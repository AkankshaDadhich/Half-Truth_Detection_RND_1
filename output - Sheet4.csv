9341,false,John Boehner,The Democrat-backed health care reform plan will require (Americans) to subsidize abortion with their hard-earned tax dollars.,"In an already contentious health care debate, the last thing the Obama administration wants is a fight over abortion. The word abortion was never mentioned in the initial health care plans released by the House and Senate. The decision of whether to offer abortion coverage in the proposed public plan, then, would be left up to the health and human services secretary. Abortion opponents said that would allow Democrats to slip abortion into the plan as part of the standard coverage. In an op-ed piece on July 23, House Republican Leader John Boehner of Ohio repeated the concerns of many who oppose abortion that the Democratic-backed health care reform plan will require (Americans) to subsidize abortion with their hard-earned tax dollars. Although there are several versions of the health care bill kicking around in Congress, one thing has now become clear: Most envision a government-run health plan option that could include abortion coverage, as well as a health care exchange in which participating private insurance companies would be permitted to offer such coverage. But does that mean that federal tax dollars would be used to subsidize abortions? That's a more difficult question. Let's back up a minute and explain some background: Currently, the 1976 Hyde Amendment prohibits the use of federal funds for abortions through Medicaid except in cases of rape, incest or when the mother's health is in peril. So states that want to offer abortion coverage have to pay for it themselves. Similar restrictions on public funding for abortions applies to federal health care coverage extended to active and retired military and federal employees. President Barack Obama gave a nod to that precedent when asked in a July 21 CBS interview with Katie Couric whether he favored a government option that would cover abortions. Obama said, As you know, I'm prochoice. But I think we also have a tradition of, in this town, historically, of not financing abortions as part of government-funded health care. Rather than wade into that issue at this point, I think that it's appropriate for us to figure out how to just deliver on the cost savings, and not get distracted by the abortion debate at this station. Abortion opponents had hoped similar restrictions to those in the Hyde Amendment would be placed on any government-run health care option, and also be extended to any private insurance companies that participate in the government-sponsored health care exchange, which will provide health insurance for people who don't get it through their employer. To that end, Rep. Bart Stupak, D-Mich., offered an amendment to the House health care proposal that would prohibit the use of public money to cover any part of the costs of any health plan that includes coverage of abortion. The amendment was narrowly defeated. Donna Crane, policy director for NARAL Pro-Choice America, called Stupak's proposal a radical departure from the status quo, because millions of women who currently have private insurance plans that cover abortions would be stripped of that coverage if their plan ultimately became part of the exchange — which seems likely. According to a 2002 Guttmacher Institute study, 87 percent of employment-based insured health plans offered coverage for abortions (though not all companies select it for their employees). A 2003 Kaiser Family Foundation survey found that 46 percent of covered workers had coverage for abortions. The two surveys asked different questions, but the bottom line is that a significant percentage of women currently have health insurance that covers abortions. And so began the debate over how to make the health care reform bill abortion neutral. A compromise plan offered by Rep. Lois Capps, D-Calif., which passed the House Energy and Commerce Committee, seeks to alleviate many of the concerns expressed by abortion opponents — particularly the issue of tax dollars being used to subsidize abortions — while specifically making abortion coverage available in both the public plan and in private plans participating in the exchange. Under the Capps amendment: • Abortion coverage would not be part of the required minimum benefits package. In other words, insurers would not be required to offer, or be prohibited from offering, abortion services in order to participate in the exchange. • The public plan could include abortion coverage, but the cost of the additional coverage could not be paid through public subsidies (tax dollars), only through the premiums paid by the insured. And with private plans in the exchange, again, federal subsidies could not be used for abortion coverage. • Public funding would only be permitted for abortions allowed under the Hyde Amendment — in cases of rape, incest or when the mother's life is in danger. • At least one plan in every region must offer full abortion coverage; and one must not. • Any insurance plan participating in the exchange cannot discriminate against hospitals or other health care facilities (such as Catholic hospitals) that are unwilling to provide abortions. • The plan will not pre-empt any state laws regarding abortion, such as parental notification laws. Douglas Johnson, legislative director for National Right to Life, said the amendment is hardly a compromise, and the pledge not to prohibit the use of public funds amounts to little more than symbolic bookkeeping. The Capps amendment may claim to segregate funds used for abortions, he said, but the bottom line is you have the government paying subsidies to people who are then able to obtain abortion coverage. And, he said, It's still the government running the whole plan. The government would be participating in the killing of unborn children under the guise of a health care plan, Johnson said. But that's not the opinion of all antiabortion groups. Chris Korzen, executive director of Catholics United, which opposes abortion, said his group doesn't want to see an important health care plan derailed by a misleading campaign that claims the health care plan would mean taxpayer-subsidized abortions. The goal should be to maintain the current policies, Korzen said. That Capps amendment accomplishes just that. It specifically prohibits taxpayers' funding of abortions. It disappoints me that there are people who are still making that claim. And, he said, there's a lot to be happy about, including the fact that abortion coverage was not included as part of the required minimum benefits package. Crane said NARAL believes abortion should be treated like any other health service. But they think the Capps amendment at least maintains the status quo, and that it helped to alleviate many of the concerns expressed by abortion opponents. We thought they got everything they wanted, Crane said. We are confused why they continue to push. Obviously, there's a lot at stake in the health care bill for both sides in the abortion debate. The fact that several versions of the health care reform bill are floating around Congress makes it difficult to say with certainty what the final plan will or will not include. But while it appears likely the plan would allow for the coverage of abortions, we don't see anything in the plans that would require taxpayers to foot the bill for that. In fact, in a key version of the bill — the one passed by the House Energy and Commerce Committee — members went to great pains to include an amendment to ensure that federal money is not used for abortion coverage. Again, things could change as the health reform package works its way through Congress, but for now, we don't see anything to support Boehner's claim that taxpayers would subsidize abortions. And so we rule his statement False."
8322,false,Josh Hawley,Says a bill co-sponsored by Sen. Claire McCaskill would give a free pass to any illegal immigrant who brings a child to the border.,"Missouri Attorney General Josh Hawley and outside groups supporting his campaign have criticized Sen. Claire McCaskill for her views on immigration during their Senate race. A recent salvo in this subtext of their contest comes from Hawley in the form of an op-ed for FoxNews.com.  now she (McCaskill) is sponsoring the most radical open-border bill ever introduced in Congress, Hawley wrote. Her bill was written by California liberal Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein, and it would give a free pass to any illegal immigrant who brings a child to the border. Hawley is referring to the Keep Families Together Act, which would bar family separations except if the child is at risk of trafficking and abuse by parents or guardians. Kelli Ford, the Hawley campaigns press secretary, said that Hawleys free pass comments meant that if you are an immigrant coming here illegally with a child, this bill would let you enter into the United States. With immigration becoming a wedge issue between McCaskill and Hawley, we spoke to experts and consulted the text of the bill to determine the accuracy of Hawleys assertion. Ford pointed to the language of the bill from Section 2(a), which, in her words, tells agents/officers that they cant remove a child from a parent/legal guardian within the 100-mile limit of the United States. Thats true — with exceptions. Border officials could separate if the child is a victim of trafficking or at significant risk of it; if there's a strong likelihood that the adult is not the parent; or if the child is in danger of abuse or neglect. State courts and state or county child welfare agencies can also separate families if it's in the child's best interest. Finally, Ford pointed to an excerpt from the bill that says children cant be removed from guardians solely for the policy goal of deterring individuals from migrating to the United States or for the policy goal of promoting compliance with civil immigration laws. Hawleys depiction of the Keeping Families Together Act is incorrect, experts said. The bill would not grant illegal immigrants a pass — free or otherwise — to enter or live legally or illegally in the United States, David Bier, an immigration policy analyst at the libertarian Cato Institute think tank wrote in an email. It would only prohibit the separation of children from their parents who come to the border unless the child is a victim of trafficking or abuse. Bier went on to write that the bill does not forbid the removal of parents who are undocumented immigrants from the U.S., meaning it does not change existing immigration law, nor does it seek to make it easier for such parents or guardians to stay in the U.S. Leon Fresco, an immigration attorney based in Washington, D.C., put his objections to Hawleys claim simply: Nothing in this bill prevents the removal of a family unit in its entirety. The bill does not block families from being detained together, said Fresco, aformer deputy assistant attorney general who drafted the Senates comprehensive immigration reform bill in 2013. While Fresco understands the reasoning behind thinking its wrong to prevent the government from prosecuting an adult for crossing the border illegally if they bring their child, that is not what this proposed law would do. It only prevents the separation of the adult and the child, Fresco wrote. The bill does not put forth safeguards for immigrants without documentation; adults can still be prosecuted. Matt Barreto, UCLA professor of political science and Chicana/o studies, was adamant in his disagreement with Hawleys conclusion about the bill: It absolutely does not do that. It just blocks DHS/CBP from taking children away from their parents, Barreto wrote in an email. People still have to go through all the normal procedures for asylum, refugee or immigration. The Hawley campaign pointed out that Barretos firm Latino Decisions did polling work for the Hillary Clinton campaign. Hawley said McCaskill backed a bill that would give a free pass to any illegal immigrant who brings a child to the border. The bill in question takes no such measure. Undocumented immigrants are not afforded any new protections from prosecution under the bill; it seeks to stop the separation of immigrant children from their families or guardians. The thinking behind Hawleys charge against McCaskill has been echoed by Republican officials throughout the country. That doesnt make it more right. Update, Oct. 6, 11:30p.m.: The article has been updated to add context to two sources, Leon Fresco and Matt Barreto."
7357,false,Facebook posts,"The toxicity of COVID-Omicron is 5 times higher than that of the delta variant, and the mortality rate is also higher than that of Delta.","The omicron variant of the COVID-19 virus screeched onto the global stage in late November, with ominous warnings about how fast it could spread and questions about whether it could evade vaccines. Theres a lot that scientists still dont know about the variant that can only be learned with time and further research. But we spotted one lengthy and widely shared Facebook post that warned about omicrons dangers and included some very specific data points we had not seen before. Among them: The toxicity of COVID-Omicron is 5 times higher than that of the Delta variant, and the mortality rate is also higher than that of Delta, the Dec. 4 post said. The post was flagged as part of Facebooks efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Its not clear where this data originated. We saw the same post being shared publicly by others as early as Dec. 3 with no source information. Toxicity is not a commonly referenced measure of COVID-19 variants, so its unclear what point the speaker was trying to make. And there is no evidence so far to support the claim that the mortality rate for omicron is higher than delta. Early indications suggest that omicron might result in milder illness. But it also appears to be highly transmissible. Because hospitalizations and deaths usually lag outbreaks of cases, experts still need time to study the trends. On whether the variant could be less severe, Dr. Emily S. Gurley, an epidemiologist at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, told The New York Times, It would not be shocking if thats true, but Im not sure we can conclude that yet. Omicron was first identified by researchers in South Africa, who reported it to the World Health Organization on Nov. 24. The WHO designated it as a variant of concern two days later, citing its large number of mutations; evidence of an increased risk of COVID-19 reinfection with the variant; and the number of cases that were appearing in South Africa. The omicron variant has since been identified in at least 50 countries, including the United States. In a preliminary study published Dec. 2 that has not been peer-reviewed, scientists in South Africa said omicron was at least three times more likely to cause reinfection than previous coronavirus variants beta and delta. And newer studies, including from Pfizer and BioNTech, suggest ​​omicron can partially dodge immune defenses granted by vaccines, which seems to be strengthening the case for boosters, including the possibility of a fourth shot. As far as the harshness of illness goes, Dr. Anthony Fauci, White House chief medical adviser, on Dec. 5 said that further study is needed before anything definitive can be determined. Thus far, he said on CNNs State of the Union show, it does not look like there's a great degree of severity to it. In South Africa, hospital researchers said current patients are experiencing milder illness than those who had other variants of the virus, including delta. One doctor said symptoms of omicron that she has witnessed include fatigue and a scratchy throat, but no cough. And a very small study in South Africa of 42 patients admitted to a hospital between Nov. 14 and 29 showed that most didnt need oxygen, and many had initially come to the hospital seeking treatment for other illnesses, not COVID-19. The study has not been peer-reviewed, and the researchers did not know how many of the COVID-19 patients were infected with the omicron variant, though the government reported last week that it already accounted for three-quarters of virus samples in South Africa, the New York Times reported. Meanwhile, Harvard experts warned Dec. 7 that omicron could overtake delta as the dominant strain within a matter of weeks because of its transmissibility. That remains difficult to confirm until more information is available because conditions vary in each country, and the U.S. has much higher vaccination rates than South Africa. A Facebook post says, The toxicity of COVID-Omicron is 5 times higher than that of the delta variant, and the mortality rate is also higher than that of Delta. Its not clear where these data points originate and we find no evidence of them in available research to date. Early evidence indicates omicron might result in milder illness. But research has found it is highly transmissible, can cause reinfection at a rate of at least three times higher than prior COVID-19 variants and has the power to elude some of the protections vaccines give. But more information is still needed, in part because hospitalizations and deaths usually lag outbreaks of cases. That said, there is nothing in the research so far that indicates the data reported in this post is accurate."

Sandy Pasch, her recall opponent, voted to allow public school employees to use taxpayer dollars to pick up the tab forViagra.","One of the eye-catching direct mail pieces of the Senate recall campaigns is Republican Sen. Alberta Darlings depiction of her opponent, Democrat Sandy Pasch, on the screen of an electronic tablet.iBad, The Sandy Pasch Edition, the mailer shouts.It invents applications such as iSpend, iTax, iOink, and iBilk to paint Pasch as a tax and spend liberal.The iBilk, the mailer says, runs union applications that send taxpayer dollars to the bedroom -- for Viagra -- instead of the classroom.Thats right, Viagra is a topic in the Milwaukee-area Senate recall to be decided Aug. 9, 2011.Darling also focuses on the issue in a campaign TV ad that says: Sandy Pasch even voted to allow public school employees to use taxpayer dollars to pick up the tab forViagra.Did Pasch, D-Whitefish Bay, vote to give teachers health insurance coverage that paid for Viagra and other pills for erectile dysfunction?The Viagra issue won wide publicity in 2010 when the Milwaukee Teachers Education Association sued the Milwaukee Public Schools over the issue, claiming men were unfairly discriminated against by an MPS decision to stop covering the pills.MPS first agreed to cover the drugs in 2002, leading to 1,002 claims for such drugs from MPS employees by 2004. During negotiations with the union for its 2003-2005 contract, MPS tried to stop coverage of the drugs, citing rising costs.An arbitrator sided with the district in 2005, leading to further appeals that ultimately did not go the unions way. The 2010 union lawsuit was dropped in March 2011, in effect settling the issue in favor of the district.We asked Darlings camp to explain the connection between the nearly decade-old MPS dispute and Pasch, who was elected in 2008.Andrew Davis, Darlings campaign manager, did not cite a specific vote on the MPS issue or on coverage of Viagra.He offered a more general response, saying that Pasch has stood with unions and backed union rights in the controversy over Gov. Scott Walkers move -- supported by Darling -- to curtail collective bargaining for public employees.Said Davis: The extent of collective bargaining gave unions the power to bargain for Viagra, and that bill was put on the backs of the taxpayers.But thats not what the TV ad said.Pasch is pro-union, and has supported a reversal of the collective bargaining limits that Walker and GOP lawmakers put through. But she has at times disagreed with the Milwaukee teachers union.That union recently declined to reopen bargaining to talk about contributing more toward teachers benefits in order to possibly save some jobs. Pasch said she wished they had come back to the table.But there was no legislative vote related to Viagra.And Pasch came into public life three years after an arbitrator ruled MPS could deny Viagra to employees.Darling tries to make the case that collective bargaining enabled the union to get Viagra coverage. But MPS management was the party that signed off on it. Even if MPS didnt have to negotiate with employees in the early 2000s, it could have added the drugs. And it didnt need an end to collective bargaining in 2011 to make the call to drop the drugs -- it did that years earlier.The bottom line?In seeking to tap into anger in some quarters over the Viagra issue, Darling claims Pasch voted to allow it for school district employees.Darling cites Paschs support for collective bargaining. But there was no vote in Madison on the matter. The issue was resolved in Milwaukee when an arbitrator ruled in favor of the school district -- years before Pasch came to office."

A viral Feb. 23 post on Facebook says, It was revealed in court a few moments ago that Tory Lanez DNA WAS NOT found on the weapon in the Meg Thee Stallion case.

It is our hope that we will be able to review and confirm the (Los Angeles Police Departments) analysis, which from our standpoint was favorable. But the precise nature of the LAPD analysis and its results were not disclosed or described, Dillon wrote in a follow-up tweet. There is a discovery protective order on this case, so it's not public. The Los Angeles County District Attorneys Office told a news organization, We believe the evidence substantially supports the charges and allegations and that evidence will be borne out in court. Lanez is charged with one count of assault with a semiautomatic handgun and one count of carrying a loaded, unregistered firearm in a vehicle.

9201,false,Facebook posts,The CDC was normalizing blood clots by tweeting about the health condition before the Super Bowl.,"A few days before Super Bowl LVI , the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention referenced the game in a tweet about how to safeguard against the common risk of blood clots. That prompted several vaccine skeptics on social media to respond that it was an effort by the agency at normalizing blood clots. Normalizing blood clots, read a Feb. 12 Facebook post that shared a screenshot of the CDC tweet from two days prior. Maybe, if you avoid a certain strongly pushed jab you wont have to worry so much about this. & if you get CO\/ID you can take aspirin or NAC. Have they EVER before put out anything like this for the SuperBowl? The answer would be NO. The post was flagged as part of Facebooks efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The pre-Super Bowl tweet, however, was not the first time the CDC took to Twitter to warn about the dangers of blood clots. We found instances of such tweets published in February and March of 2015, years before there was a COVID-19, as well as twice in October of 2020, before there was an authorized COVID-19 vaccine in the U.S. Neither was it the first time the CDC tied such a warning to a big sporting event. In 2016, it also warned its Twitter followers during March Madness about the dangers of blood clots. The CDC did not return a request for comment for this article. The best defense is a good offense! Defend yourself against #bloodclots w/ these tips. #MarchMadness pic.twitter.com/6F8UO9aYWY Blood clots are normal and are the bodys way of stopping bleeding after an injury. Those clots normally dissolve on their own and are harmless. But venous thromboembolism, which refers to clots that form in the veins, can be deadly. VTE consists of deep vein thrombosis (clots that usually begin in the legs but sometimes in the arm or pelvis) and pulmonary embolism (when a deep-vein clot dislodges and travels to the lungs). The CDC says these types of blood clots affect about 900,000 people yearly in the U.S. and that about 100,000 people die from them. Its the leading cause of death in people with cancer, aside from the cancer itself. It also is a leading cause of death in pregnant women or those who have just given birth. Blood clots can happen to anyone, even athletes, but there are risk factors, including injuries, surgery, chronic illnesses, obesity and extended periods of limited movement, such as during long flights. The Pfizer and Moderna vaccines were first authorized for emergency use in December 2020 and the Johnson & Johnson vaccine was given emergency authorization in February 2021. There have been some reports of people developing blood clots after COVID-19 vaccination, but they are very rare. According to the CDC and the FDA, there have been 57 confirmed reports of people who received the Johnson & Johnson vaccine and later developed a rare clotting disorder called thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS). Thats out of more than 18 million doses given in the U.S., as of Feb. 3. There have been nine deaths related to TTS among Johnson & Johnson vaccine recipients, according to the CDC. It recommends the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines instead, although it said the Johnson & Johnson vaccine can still be offered. There have been three confirmed cases of TTS among Moderna vaccine recipients out of more than 522 million doses, according to the CDC, which said that there is not an increased risk of TTS from the vaccine. The COVID-19 vaccine developed by AstraZeneca and Oxford University has also been tied to a rare blood clot disorder. Scientists believe they have figured out the cause: its use of another harmless virus that can leak into the bloodstream and bind to a protein that is involved in the natural clotting process, The New York Times reported. The AstraZeneca vaccine has not been authorized for use in the U.S. Health experts say that patients who are infected with COVID-19 commonly develop blood clots due to the virus. The virus is very well known to cause blood clots, so your odds of getting COVID-induced blood clots if you catch COVID are higher than the vaccine induced blood clots, Dr. Shruti Gohil, associate medical director for epidemiology and infection prevention and assistant professor of infectious diseases, at the University of California, Irvine, School of Medicine, told PolitiFact in October. The SARS-CoV-2 infection causes high levels of inflammation, which could trigger clotting often seen in COVID-19 patients, according to the National Heart Blood and Lung Institute. A Facebook post expressing skepticism about the safety of the COVID-19 vaccines claimed the CDC was normalizing blood clots by tweeting about it before the Super Bowl. Blood clots are common and can kill up to 100,000 Americans a year. The CDC has previously tweeted about the dangers of blood clots, including during the 2016 NCAA college basketball tournament. The Johnson & Johnson vaccine has been linked to rare cases of TTS, and the CDC said people should get the Pfizer and Moderna instead. Another vaccine from AstraZeneca, which has not been authorized for use in the U.S., has been linked to a separate, rare clotting disorder. Meanwhile, people are at risk of developing blood clots from the COVID-19 infection itself, which causes inflammation in the body. The post is wrong to suggest that the CDCs warning about blood clots is a new thing and that its somehow tied to COVID-19 vaccines."
4547,false,Karin Housley,Tina (Smith) profited from the opioid crisis. ​,"In a recent Minnesota Republican ad for U.S. Senate, a man and woman clink flutes of champagne on the beach as text rolls across the screen: Tina Smith loves the good life. Smith is defending her U.S. Senate seaton Nov. 6. She was appointed to the position earlier this year after fellow Democrat Al Franken stepped down following sexual misconduct allegations. The good life ad comes from Smiths Republican challenger, state Sen. Karin Housley, and the text on screen quickly departs from the beach scenes serenity.  The next line: Tina profited from the opioid crisis. The ad lists other dubious ways Smith supposedly enjoys herself, but this one caught our attention. We decided to see if the claim that Smith benefited financially from the opioid crisis held any water. As evidence of Smith profiting from the opioid crisis, Housleys campaign sent us financial disclosure forms, pointing to Smith and her husbands jointly owned stock in Abbott Laboratories of a value between $250,000 and $500,000. The Smiths invested in St. Jude Medical, a medical device company, which was acquired by Abbott Laboratories in 2017. After the acquisition, St. Jude Medical stock was changed to Abbott stock. In 1996, Abbott partnered in aggressive OxyContin marketing with Purdue Pharma — the company responsible for introducing OxyContin as a supposedly safe opioid pill. In OxyContins first year on the market, Abbott made $49 million. That annual figure had jumped to $1.6 billion by 2002.  But Abbott cut off its opioid connections in 2002, nearly 15 years before it acquired the company in which the Smiths held stock.The Housley campaign also pointed out that Archie Smith, Tinas husband, held between $1,000 and $15,000 in stock in Johnson & Johnson, which has been sued for its role in the opioid crisis. Johnson & Johnson is a also a parent company of two companies that have also been sued for marketing opioids. In Smiths most recent financial report, the income from that stock was between $200 and $1,000. Housley claimed Smith profited from the opioid crisis. The idea that the Smiths benefited financially from Abbott Laboratories actions a full 14 years before the company acquired St. Jude Medical goes too far. Smiths husband does hold between $1,000 and $15,000 in stock in Johnson & Johnson, but it's hard to draw a straight line from that amount ofstock ownership to profiting off the opioid crisis. Overall, the statement is not accurate."
17407,false,Mitt Romney,Says President Barack Obama has opened up no new trade relationships with other nations.,"During the Jan. 7, 2012, Republican presidential debate in Manchester, N.H., former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney took a shot at President Barack Obamas trade policies. We have to open up markets for our goods, Romney said. We haven't done that under this president. European nations and China over the last three years have opened up 44 different trade relationships with various nations in theworld. This president has opened up none. We wont check the claim about European and Chinese trade deals here, but we will look at whetherRomney is correct about Obamas record on trade agreements. After lengthy negotiations, Obama signed tradeagreements withthree separate nations on Oct. 21, 2011 -- South Korea, Colombia, and Panama. These were not trivial deals. The one with South Korea, in particular, was the largest trade deal since 1994, when the U.S. approved the North American Free Trade Agreement, Bloomberg News reported at the time, citing administration data. The South Korea deal was poised to increase U.S. export access for everything from cars to farm goods, Bloomberg wrote. All three deals were initially forged under President George W. Bush, but Bush was unable to get the deals past a Democratic-controlled Congress. After the GOP took control of Congress in the 2010 midterm elections, Congressional Republicans pointed to the proposed deals as rare areas of possible cooperation between the two parties. But implementation negotiationsinitially stalled amid administration insistence on securing protections for workers. During the 2008 campaign, Obama had promisedto use trade agreements to spread good labor and environmental standards around the world. Even though negotiations with lawmakers dragged on, the administration was ultimately able to secure a legislative formulation that could garner enough votes to pass. Doing so required some political risk for the president with his own base, since a sizable faction within his own party is skeptical of expanding free trade agreements.(Public Citizen, a group that opposed all three agreements, produceda detailed comparison of whatObama promised and what the trade agreement with South Korea contains.) We askedthe Romney campfor their view, anda spokesman said that Romney wasreferring tonewdeals initiated and completedby this administration, rather thandealsinitiatedduring the previous administration and closed by Obama. But we think that'sa misleading standard.If that's what Romneymeans, he's effectivelystripping Obama of any credit for enactmentofthe three trade agreements, when in factbringing them to fruitionrequired significant negotiating effortswith lawmakers ofthe opposite party (and led to an achievementthat eluded his predecessor, Bush). Our ruling It did take the better part of three years for Obama and Congress to enact the languishing South Korea, Colombia and Panama trade agreements. But ultimately he did reach an accord with lawmakers that enabled the agreements relatively easy passage in both the House and the Senate, including strong support from Republicans as well as the votes of several dozen Democratic lawmakers. To say of trade relationships that Obama has opened up none deserves aratingofFalse."
12254,half-true,John McCain,"The border security plan of Sens. McCain and Kyl called for 3,000 additional troops to keep us safe. President Obama says he'll send 524.","Sen. John McCain of Arizona is up for re-election and facing a challenge in the Republican primary from J.D. Hayworth. His latest television ad ignores his primary opponent, instead going after President Barack Obama and emphasizing that McCain is committed to border security.The border security plan of Sens. McCain and Kyl called for 3,000 additional troops to keep us safe. President Obama says he'll send 524, the narrator says. This is no political game, Mr. President. It's about Arizona lives. It's a fight we must win. And with John McCain on our side, we will.We wanted to check whether it was true that McCain called for 3,000 troops while Obama said he would send 524.First, we checked out the plan outlined by McCain Sen. John Kyl, R-Ariz.. The 10-point proposal was released in April and includes the following point:Immediately deploy 3,000 National Guard Troops along the Arizona/Mexico border, along with appropriate surveillance platforms, which shall remain in place until the Governor of Arizona certifies, after consulting with state, local and tribal law enforcement, that the Federal Government has achieved operational control of the border. Permanently add 3,000 Custom and Border Protection Agents to the Arizona/Mexico border by 2015.McCain and Kyl introduced a bill to carry out the plan in May, but there has been no significant action on the proposed legislation.But McCain did add an amendment to a pending appropriations bill that authorizes defense spending; the amendment would send 6,000 troops to the border area, double the number McCain mentioned in his ad. The bill has not yet come up for a vote in the full Senate.Now, for Obama's plan. Obama announced in May that he was sending 1,200 National Guard troops to the southwest border to help with border security. The troops were sent to different states: 524 to Arizona, 250 to Texas, 224 to California, and 72 to New Mexico. Other troops were to serve in command and control or support positions in various states, according to the U.S. Army.But Obama has also asked Congress to pass emergency legislation to add 1,000 new border patrol agents. That legislation is pending, and the number has been increased to 1,500 agents. It does not specify how many agents would be assigned to which states. McCain said he supports the bill and that it should be passed as quickly as possible.So McCain supports 3,000 to 6,000 additional troops. On Obama's side, you could count the 1,200 National Guard troops he sent in May, plus 1,500 agents to be funded by legislation Obama is expected to sign upon passage. That totals 2,700, or 2,200, if you only count Obama's original request to Congress.In his ad, McCain gives a fair description of his own proposal calling for 3,000 more troops. But he downplays the number of personnel Obama has called for. The number 524 represents only National Guard troops being sent to Arizona as part an initiative announced in May. It does not include the 1,000 to 1,500 additional border patrol agents in proposed legislation that Obama supports, some of whom would be assigned to Arizona. Still, McCain does appear to want more new agents and troops sent to the border than Obama does."
13503,half-true,Mary Burke,The nation as a whole has created jobs at a rate that is two times the rate that we have created jobs here in Wisconsin under Gov. Walker.,"Introducing President Barack Obama in Milwaukee, Democratic gubernatorial hopeful Mary Burke touted economic growth nationwide when compared to that in Wisconsin under Gov. Scott Walker: The nation as a whole has created jobs at a rate that is two times the rate that we have created jobs here in Wisconsin under Gov. Walker. Asked to back up the claim, the Burke campaign pointed us to data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics quarterly employment surveys. That data is considered the most reliable measure of jobs, though it is less timely than that from separate monthly employment surveys. The campaign told us the statistics show U.S. growth at nearly twice the rate of Wisconsin. Burke, though, was more definitive at the rally, saying two times the rate. Burkes phrasing of the talking point has changed. In early 2014, she said the latest data from the quarterly surveys showed the national rate was nearly double Wisconsins rate. At that point, she quoted a Milwaukee Journal Sentinel story that came to the same conclusion after Wisconsin reported 1 percent growth compared with 1.9% nationally from June 2012 to June 2013. At the time, that was the latest available data, due to the lag time in the release of the detailed quarterly numbers, We crunched the same numbers the Burke campaign cited, examining private-sector employment, which has been the central focus of both candidates plans. Figures show that from the start of Walkers term to the end of his third year, the national gain was 6.6 percent compared to Wisconsins 4.1 percent. That meant the U.S. growth was 1.6 times that of Wisconsins. In the most recent year (March 2013 to March 2014), Wisconsins growth rate was 1.3 percent, compared with the U.S. rate of 2.1 percent. Same result: the national rate was 1.6 times better. As we examined year-over-year growth at different quarterly vantage points, we repeatedly saw growth 1.6 to 1.7 times larger for the national figures. (We also looked at results from another government jobs survey, the monthly reports. They are more up to date -- through September 2014 -- but less reliable. They, too, show, national growth at 1.6 times the states, from the start of Walkers term.) There were some smaller and larger differences at various points along the way. Annual growth rates in the United States in 2011, 2012 and 2013, and into early 2014 ranged from 1.2 to 2 times larger than Wisconsins. The high point was from September 2011 to September 2012, when the rate was twice that of Wisconsin. Our rating Burke claimed that the nation as a whole has created jobs at a rate that is two times the rate that we have created jobs here in Wisconsin under Gov. Walker. Wisconsin lags behind the nation significantly, but for the most part quite not as badly as Burke says, based on the last year and on results from most of Walkers term."
11341,half-true,Facebook posts,Most Americans on minimum wage earn less than a Dickensian allegory for destitution.,"In Charles Dickens 1843 classic A Christmas Carol, Ebenezer Scrooges poor, put-upon clerk Bob Cratchit certainly didnt have the best working conditions. He labored long hours for a classic micromanager, who paid him a salary that made raising a family of six children difficult, especially with a tiny child with big medical problems. One person on social media used the Cratchit character to try to make a point about the plight of Americans working for minimum wage today. A Facebook post on Dec. 19 shared a screenshot of a tweet by a user who wrote: Time for your annual reminder that, according to A Christmas Carol, Bob Cratchit makes 15 shillings a week. Adjusted for inflation, that's $530.27/wk, $27,574/yr, or $13.50/hr. Most Americans on minimum wage earn less than a Dickensian allegory for destitution. This post was flagged as part of Facebooks efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The Facebook post by The Other 98% now includes a label that it is missing context and the caption notes that the post has been fact-checked by Lead Stories, which wrote that there was no evidence to support the claim. The author of the original tweet later admitted his claim was based on super-sloppy googling. The federal minimum wage in the U.S. is $7.25 an hour and has not been raised since 2009. However, 30 states, plus three territories, have minimum wages higher than the federal level, the highest being $15.20 in the District of Columbia. Many cities or counties also have minimum wages higher than the federal or state levels, including a high of $17.13 in Emeryville, Calif., and many employers are surpassing the required minimum as they face difficulty filling jobs during the pandemic, CNBC reported. We spoke with several experts about the posters claim, and the consensus is there is really no perfect way to make such a comparison. There are various ways to calculate what 15 shillings in 1840 would be in English pounds today, and they dont give the same answer, said George Boyer, the senior associate dean for academic affairs and professor of economics, and international and comparative labor at Cornell Universitys School of Industrial and Labor Relations Moreover, you then need to convert to U.S. currency, and the value of the dollar in terms of British pounds is far different from what it was in 1840. So 10 different people doing the calculation would get 10 different answers, he said. Vincent Geloso, an assistant professor of economics at George Mason University who specializes in the measurement of living standards now and in the past, said the post appears wrong on a great many levels, first of which is the numbers are just off. But are the numbers even relevant? Cratchit is not exactly the allegory for destitution the post claims. He was a skilled worker that would have made much more than many workers in the Victorian era, they said. Geloso said the comparison is meaningless, arguing that Cratchit was paid well above the median Briton and that his annual income of 39 pounds was only a bit less than the U.K. average of 57 pounds in 1846. He said that a well-known measure called welfare ratios, which estimate earnings divided by the cost of a basket of subsistence goods, show that Cratchit could buy more than six times that basket, far more than the poorest workers. Cratchit was thus well above the poverty line, Geloso wrote. Boyer also said the comparison in the post is off base. The key thing for Thompson and others to remember is that Cratchits occupation was clerk. He was NOT one of the working poor. Saying that Cratchits wage was above todays minimum wage is not a relevant calculation. He could have been a badly paid clerk and still made more than a member of the lower working class, Boyer said, adding that comparing the wages of day laborers in that era may have made a better choice. Gregory Clark, an economics professor at the University of California, Davis, argued that Cratchit would be worse off than todays minimum wage worker, saying, The tweet overestimates the hourly wage in 1843 in terms of purchasing power by about eightfold. Clark said Cratchit, as a relatively skilled worker in a time when 40% of men were illiterate, would have been well paid for that time, though he lived in a high-cost city. But, he said, his wages, based on a 60-hour work week, amount to a meager purchasing power of only $1.70 per hour in todays U.S. dollars. Samuel Williamson, co-founder and president of the economic data site MeasuringWorth and professor emeritus of economics at Miami University in Ohio, pointed us to two blog posts he wrote about Cratchits salary and what it would be worth today. In one, he writes that Cratchit was poorly paid for the job he had, but would have had a salary with a relative earnings value of $43,000 in U.S. dollars in 2020, or $21.44 per hour, based on a 40-hour work week, far more than the $13.50 cited in the tweet. In the other, he also calculated the same figure as Clark on the real wage value of 15 shillings, but said that value is computed using a retail consumer price index of a basket of goods and services and is unrealistic because the market baskets purchased by representative consumers have changed so much. He said that the relative earnings value is a better comparison and wrote in another essay that most measures of worth are better than using the CPI. Experts we spoke with agree that the average work week in the Victorian era would be more than 40 hours, probably at least 60. Dividing Williamsons $43,000 figure by 60 hours gets you to the original posters $13.50 figure. But the post seems to ignore the gains made by workers, said James Kincaid, a professor emeritus of English at the University of Southern California and editor of The Daily Charles Dickens: A Year in Quotes. It seems to suggest that all the efforts of organized labor have done nothing more than maintain the status quo, and that's nonsense, said Kincaid, who said the average worker in that era worked 66 to 75 hours per week. Kincaid said there is no good way to determine what 15 shillings then would amount to in U.S. wages today. He added that Dickens knew what a barely-above-starvation wage would be for a worker like Cratchit with his family would be, as did his readers. A Facebook post based on a tweet said that a Charles Dickens allegory for destitution made more than most American workers today do on a minimum wage salary. Cratchits earnings outperformed U.S. minimum-wage earners, but his experience was not a portrayal of a low-wage worker. Cratchit was making far more than the average worker in London during the Victorian era, experts say. The comparison between 1840s shillings and todays dollars is problematic. One expert said Cratchit would be making $21.44 per hour in todays dollars, assuming a 40-hour week. CORRECTION:We updated this fact-check on Jan. 4 to correct the name of Cornell professor George Boyer."
15136,half-true,Sherrod Brown,"Says the average Ohio student graduates from a four-year college or university with nearly $27,000 in tuition debt.","Editor's note: We originally rated this claim True. After receiving feedback from readers, we have downgraded that rating to Half True because the claim applies the average debt of about $27,000 to a much broader group than did the study from which it was cited. Interest rates on federally subsidized student loans went on the front burner as a political issue after Mitt Romney followed President Obama in saying he did not want those rates to go up. Congressional Republicans -- who earlier passed a budget allowing the rates to double in July to their 2007 rate of 6.8 percent -- closed ranks behind their presumptive presidential nominee.They voted for a hastily introduced bill that would keep the rate at 3.4 percent, and pay for it with funds intended for preventive health care programs under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.Raiding that fund made the legislation unpalatable for Democrats -- just as the Democratic proposals to extend the lower interest rates were unpalatable to Republicans.One of the proposals would have paid for the college loan subsidies by ending tax subsidies for oil and gas companies. Another would end a payroll tax exemption given some business owners.Ohio's Sen. Sherrod Brown was a co-sponsor of the latter bill and of earlier legislation to stop the loan rates from going up.Federally-subsidized Stafford loans have allowed thousands of students—who might not otherwise be able pay for to college—afford the ever-increasing cost of higher education, he said in a news release. With the average Ohio student graduating from a four-year institution with nearly $27,000 in tuition bills, the last thing we should be doing is adding to their already-heavy debt load.The figure of $27,000 caught the notice of PolitiFact Ohio. It is more than $6,700 per year for four years of school.We asked Brown's office for his source and more information. They referred us to the Project on Student Debt, a project of the independent, nonprofit Institute for College Access and Success.Its most recent survey of public and private four-year institutions in Ohio found that 68 percent of students graduate in debt, and that the average debt on college loans is $27,713 -- the 7th-highest statewide average in the nation. (New Hampshire was highest, with average debt of $31,048; Wyoming was lowest, with $20,571.)The actual debt level is probably higher, the Project on Student Debt noted, because the data is voluntarily reported by colleges and not available for all of them.The report also reflects only graduates of public and private nonprofit colleges because few for-profit colleges report the student debt data. Based on national surveys by the U.S. Department of Education, graduates of for-profit four-year colleges are much more likely to borrow student loans, and borrow significantly more, than counterparts at nonprofit institutions.Nationally, according to a report from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, the average student loan balance per borrower is $23,300. The median balance is roughly half of that, $12,800. About one-quarter of borrowers nationally owe more than $28,000, and about 10 percent owe more than $54,000, according to the New York Fed.In aggregate, the bank said, the outstanding student loan balance now stands at about $870 billion, surpassing the nations total credit card balance ($693 billion) and the total auto loan balance ($730 billion). About 37 million people hold outstanding student loan debt.The key with all these figures is that they deal specifically with students who borrow and then graduate with loan debt.So how does that mesh with Browns claim? In his statement he said the average Ohio student graduating from a four-year institution. That describes a bigger pool of people than just the students who graduate with debt. In that most recent survey it would also include the 32 percent of the graduates who had no debt. But the figure Brown cited, nearly $27,000, was an average covering just those students who graduated with debt.Browns statement is partially accurate. He cites the correct figure from a survey on debt among college students. But he describes those affected by debt too broadly, applying the average to all rather than just those who graduate with loan balances. Including all students would lower the average for loan debt by about a third. Thats an important detail needed to fully understand Browns claim.On the Truth-O-Meter, Browns statement rates as Half True."

CONDOIEEZZA RICE SUMS UP THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY IN 75 WORDS, the 2018 post says, misspelling her name before launching into the quote: If you are taught bitterness and anger, then you will believe you are a victim. You will feel aggrieved and the twin brother of aggrievement is entitlement. So now you think you are owed something and you dont have to work for it and now youre on a really bad road to nowhere because there are people who will play to that sense of victimhood, aggrievement and entitlement, and you still wont have a job.

Searching for the quote online, we couldnt find any credible, corroborating sources. But we did find elements of the Facebook post in public remarks Rice has made in the past. Part of the quote seems to come from a 2012 speech Rice gave at a fundraiser for a congressional candidate in Utah. Rice said that what concerns here most is that the essence of who we are and we believe is actually changing, the Salt Lake Tribune reported at the time. America has never had a narrative of grievance. Weve never believed I am doing poorly because youre doing well, the paper quoted Rice as saying. The moment we begin to believe that we are doing badly because someone else is doing well, that moment that aggrievement takes over, its not long before his twin brother comes behind, and that would be entitlement. Earlier that year, during the Republican National Convention, she said something similar: My fellow Americans, ours has never been a narrative of grievance and entitlement. We have never believed that I am doing poorly because you are doing well. We have never been jealous of one another and never envious of each others successes. No, no, ours has been a belief of opportunity. And it has been a constant struggle, long and hard, up and down, to try to extend the benefits of the American dream to all. Though the Facebook post could be read to mean that Rice said this describing the Democratic Party, that does not appear to be the case at either of these two events. However, it is clear that she is advocating for Republican candidates in both speeches. As for other elements of the quote in the Facebook post, we couldnt find evidence that Rice made those statements. If such evidence emerges, well update this fact-check accordingly. In the meantime, while this Facebook post does pull from statements Rice has made, this doesnt appear to be a direct quote from Rice, or a shot at the Democratic Party."
10575,half-true,Congressional Leadership Fund,"Says Kansas U.S. House candidate Paul Davis was caught with a stripper during a drug raid and later voted to allow strip clubs to open near homes, churches, schools and daycare facilities.","A new ad from the Congressional Leadership Fund, a super PAC working to protect the GOP Majority in the U.S. House, attacks a Kansas congressional hopeful for an incident at a strip club 20 years ago. You bet we wanted to see if the facts here stood up to scrutiny. Democrat Paul Davis is locked in a competitive race with Republican Steve Watkins in Kansas 2nd Congressional District, a seat that includes Topeka, Lawrence and the communities west of Kansas City. The ad targets Davis for his alleged involvement in a 1998 strip club drug raid, where he was found in a dark room with a nearly naked woman. Whats worse than getting caught at a strip club during a drug bust? Ask Paul Davis. The ad then claims Davis was found in a VIP room with a woman wearing only a G-string.Then it says, Even worse, after Davis was caught with a stripper, he voted to allow strip clubs to open near our homes, churches, schools and even daycare facilities. Shady Paul Davis cant be trusted. Here, we are checking the details surrounding the strip club incident, along with the claim that Davis voted to allow strip clubs to operate near places like schools, homes, churches and daycares. The situation involving Davis and a strip club came to light in September 2014 during his bid for governor, which he lost. According to reports, Davis was getting a lap dance in a back room in the late 1990s when cops raided the club in search of drugs. He was not charged with a crime, but police involved in the raid reported he was found in a compromising position. Davis said he was at the wrong place at the wrong time. Independence Police Chief Harry Smith later corroborated Davis account that the candidate was not involved in any wrongdoing, or, to his knowledge, the focus of an investigation. He said Davis was questioned briefly before being released. Kelsi Browning, a spokeswoman for Davis campaign, told PolitiFact that the ad is based on something that happened 20 years ago when Davis was 26. As a new lawyer, she said, Daviswent with his boss to meet an unsavory client of the law firm. The ad refers to HB 2107, or the Community Defense Act, which was a 2011 state bill that would have prohibited strip clubs and other sexually oriented businesses from being established within 1,000 feet of the property line of an existing one as well as any schools, churches, public parks, residences, libraries or daycare centers. The bill would have also required semi-nude dancers to remain at least 6 feet away from their customers and for sexually oriented businesses to remain closed from midnight to 6 a.m. Davis was one of 28 Kansas House members who voted against the bill, which ultimately failed in the Senate. The Davis campaign says that the legislation was a perennial bill thatrarely made it out of committee. When it first came up in 2010, Davis actually voted for the bill before it was struck down in the Senate. It came up again in the 2011 session, but this time, he voted against it. Critics of the legislation, which included Davis, argued at the time that regulating these businesses was best left to cities and counties. Some also questioned taking the time to focus on the issue when the state was facing a massive budget deficit. In a Lawrence Journal-World story around the time of the vote, Davis, who was the House minority leader, was quoted saying that the Legislature was probably intruding in areas where we dont need to be. Weve got a lot more important things that we need to be dealing with here. The Congressional Leadership Fund ad says that Kansas U.S. House candidate Paul Davis was caught with a stripper during a drug raid and later voted to allow strip clubs to open near homes, churches, schools and daycares. The ad is piecing together two unrelated issues to draw an unsavory conclusion, while embellishing parts of the story. Davis did not vote to allow strip clubs to open near schools, churches, daycares and the like. He once voted against a measure that would have banned them from opening near these places. He also once voted for the same proposal. The ads claim that he was found in a strip club during a drug raid is accurate, but any suggestion he was connected to the drug raid is misplaced. Overall, this claim is partially accurate but takes things out of context."
9271,half-true,Viral image,Says Hillary Clinton threatened to bomb Iran —totally obliterate them —if she was president.,"In the wake of the U.S. airstrike that killed Iranian commander Maj. Gen. Qassem Soleimani on Jan. 3, social media users have been sharing a deceptively edited video of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton that takes her comments as a presidential candidate out of context. I want the Iranians to know that if Im president, we will attack Iran, begins the video of Clinton in one such Facebook post published on Jan. 4. And I want them to understand that because it does mean that they have to look very carefully at their society, because whatever stage of development they might be in their nuclear weapons program in the next 10 years during which they might foolishly consider launching an attack on Israel, we would be able to totally obliterate them. If Im the president, we will attack Iran. The video then cuts to footage of a bomb exploding. This post was flagged as part of Facebooks efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Clinton made the comments during a 2008 interview on ABCs Good Morning America, but there are a few things the Facebook post doesnt make clear. First, Clinton doesnt repeat, if Im president, we will attack Iran, as the video makes it seem. Second, the video excludes context. At the time, a Reuters report on the ABC interview said that Clinton wanted to make clear to Tehran what she was prepared to do as president in hopes that this warning would deter any Iranian nuclear attack against the Jewish state. During a presidential debate a week earlier, Clinton promised massive retaliation against any Iranian attack on Israel, according to Reuters. During the ABC interview, Clinton says: Well, the question was if Iran were to launch a nuclear attack on Israel, what would our response be. She then says, And I want the Iranians to know that if Im president, we will attack Iran, which is about where the Facebook video starts. French broadcaster France 24 posted other clips from that interview online that give more context to the comments that appear on Facebook. Whatever stage of development they might be, Clinton says, in their nuclear weapons program, in the next 10 years during which they might foolishly consider launching an attack on Israel, we would be able to totally obliterate them. Thats a terrible thing to say but those people who run Iran need to understand that, because that perhaps will deter them from doing something that would be reckless, foolish and tragic. Her comments drew criticism from her opponent, Barack Obama. In a separate ABC interview, Obama said: One of the things that weve seen over the last several years is a bunch of talk using words like obliterate. It doesnt actually produce good results. As Democrats criticize President Donald Trump for ordering the airstrike, Facebook users are remarking that Clintons comments didnt age well. Well leave that to you to decide. But the video is deceptively edited, taking her comments out of context and repeating one of her statements at the end of the clip as a bomb explodes."
6098,half-true,Frank Lautenberg,Guns have murdered more Americans here at home in recent years than have died on the battlefields of Iraq and Afghanistan.,"War may be good for one thing: providing U.S. Sen. Frank Lautenberg with leverage for his argument that the United States needs stricter gun laws.Lautenberg, who is pushing to reinstate a federal ban on high-capacity ammunition clips in the wake of the deadly mass shooting last month at a Colorado movie theater, said, our lax gun laws make it far too easy for murderers to commit acts of violence.Here are the facts: Guns have murdered more Americans here at home in recent years than have died on the battlefields of Iraq and Afghanistan. In support of the two wars, more than 6,500 American soldiers have lost their lives. During the same period, however, guns have been used to murder about 100,000 people on American soil, Lautenberg said in a July 30 op-ed article posted on NorthJersey.com.Lautenbergs numbers are technically correct since 2001. In fact, he could have cited just a year of gun violence in the U.S. to make his point. But experts call his comparison flawed and misleading.More pickles are consumed in New York City than in Rhode Island. Is that a good comparison? I dont think so. Because there are way more people in New York City, said Alan Lizotte, dean and professor at the school of criminal justice at The University at Albany.The Federal Bureau of Investigation tracks murders in the United States through its Uniform Crime Report program. Caley Gray, a spokesman for Lautenberg, cited that source -- which shows more than 8,700 people were murdered in the United States with firearms in 2010 -- to support the senators statement. Since 2001 -- the year the war in Afghanistan began -- more than 95,000 people have been murdered with a gun in the United States, according to the FBI data.Though those statistics do not include citizenship status, Gary Kleck, a professor of criminology at Florida State University, said my reaction is that you can safely assume that the vast majority of murder victims are U.S. citizens.That death toll is far higher than the number of U.S. military casualties from the nations recent wars.More than 6,500 U.S. military personnel have died in conflicts from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan since 2001, according to data from the U.S. Department of Defense.Gray said: The numbers speak for themselves. The bottom line and the sad truth is that far more Americans are being killed by guns in their own neighborhoods than in deadly war zones.But Kleck called the senators comparison foolish and misleading.Taking account of the very different population sizes at risk, the risk of a gun homicide (or any kind of homicide) is enormously greater in Afghanistan than in the U.S., Kleck said in an e-mail. Obviously even one homicide is one too many, but the hinted suggestion that the risk of death from a gun is even remotely as high in the U.S. as in Afghanistan is absurd.Lizotte also criticized Lautenbergs statement for focusing only on the deaths of U.S. troops. Many more people were killed in Afghanistan and Iraq than Americans, he said.For example, a July 2012 report from the Congressional Research Service noted that in Afghanistan 11,864 civilians have been killed in the conflict since 2007, when the United Nations began reporting statistics, to the end of 2011.Our rulingLautenberg said, guns have murdered more Americans here at home in recent years than have died on the battlefields of Iraq and Afghanistan, claiming that more than 6,500 American soldiers died while guns have been used to murder about 100,000 people on American soil.Though Lautenbergs numbers are mainly on target, three experts agreed that the senators statement is flawed largely because he uses raw numbers to compare two very different populations.Also, Lautenberg focuses solely on deaths of U.S. troops in Iraq and Afghanistan, when many more have died in both wars.To comment on this ruling, go to NJ.com."
18305,half-true,Andy Puzder,Obamacare has caused millions of full-time jobs to become part-time.,"Critics of the Affordable Care Act, President Barack Obamas health care law, have assembled a long list of complaints about the law. One provision thats getting increasing scrutiny these days is the penalty on employers who dont provide their workers with health insurance. For workers who are on the job at least 30 hours per week, companies must offer health coverage or be hit with a financial penalty. The Obama administration twice delayed enforcement of this requirement, but it finally took effect this month for companies with at least 100 workers, and it is set to start next year for companies with between 50 and 99 workers. (The rule will not apply to small businesses with fewer than 50 workers.) Some Republicans have urged changing the rule so the cutoff is 40 hours a week, rather than 30. The House has passed a bill to do that; its now heading to the Senate, though the White House has pledged to veto it. A reader asked us to check out a Jan. 13 column on this topic in the Wall Street Journal. It was written by Andy Puzder, the chief executive officer of CKE Restaurants, which is the parent company of Carls Jr. and Hardees. In the column, Puzder explained his companys thought process about whether and how it should provide health coverage to its employees. Puzders column makes clear that hes no fan of the Affordable Care Act, particularly the employer mandate: So what does Obamacares 30-hour rule accomplish? Some would argue that it does a lot, pointing to the previously uninsured who now have employer-sponsored health insurance. In our company, that would be 2 percent of total employees and 6 percent of eligible employees. For results like that, Obamacare has caused millions of full-time jobs to become part-time, imposed a tax on lower-income workers who cannot afford it, forced millions of people out of insurance they liked, restricted access to doctors for millions of others, and created an enormous bureaucracy that discourages our doctors and nurses while suppressing health-care system innovation. Here, well take a look at just one of these claims -- that Obamacare has caused millions of full-time jobs to become part-time. The bottom line, we found, is that there isnt enough data to state a number with any specificity. Suggesting that its millions, as Puzder did, is speculative -- something he acknowledged to PolitiFact. At the same time, the number of people experiencing a cut in hours isnt trivial, with informed estimates putting it into the low hundreds of thousands of people. Puzder elaborates When we reached out to Puzder, he sent us a detailed response. (Weve posted the full text of it here, but well excerpt it in this article.) Puzder acknowledged that there is no definitive data available on the question. That said, there is also nothing definitive to the contrary of which I am aware, he added. Puzder noted -- and other economists agree -- that employment data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics is imperfect for answering this question. The BLS threshold in hours per week for full-time employment is different than it is for the Affordable Care Act. In addition, BLS counts someone who works two 20-hour-a-week part time jobs as one full-time worker. Both of these factors complicate any calculations using BLS data. The available evidence is also murky for another reason: Its impossible to tell whether any changes actually stem from the Affordable Care Act, as opposed to the labor-market dynamics of the recovery to the Great Recession. However, Puzder provided some anecdotal evidence from his own sector -- restaurant chains -- that suggests a plausible case for millions. Many restaurant chains, he noted, are operated as franchises. In his own companys case, 230 franchisees own 73 percent of the companys 2,920 restaurants in the United States; the company itself owns the rest. While the parent company employs about 20,000 people, its domestic franchisees employ many more -- about 55,000. And industry leaders like McDonalds and Burger King have more franchises and franchise employees. The disparate nature of franchise ownership makes it difficult to calculate the number of workers who may have had their hours cut. Based on his own experience at his company and the conversations hes had with other industry CEOs, Puzder thinks its reasonable (but, he acknowledges, unscientific) to assume that 20 percent to 25 percent of their operational employees have had their hours cut to under 30 per week due to the employer mandate. And if thats the case, the math adds up quickly. The International Franchise Association counted nearly 8.1 million employees in 2012, working at 750,000 franchise establishments. If these franchise employers lowered the hours of 20 percent of these employees, that would equal 1.6 million employees. Adjusting the hours for 15 percent would impact 1.2 million. And this number doesnt include employees of the parent company; nor does it include the employees of retail companies that do not franchise. Puzder also referenced a data set being compiled by Jed Graham, a journalist with Investors Business Daily. (Editorially, Grahams publication has argued firmly against the Affordable Care Act, but several of the economists we checked with said Grahams information is valuable.) When we accessed Grahams database in January 2015, he had documented just over 450 employers that had made cuts to work hours or staffing levels as a result of Obamacare. However, this list by itself doesnt get to millions, and because it has been compiled anecdotally rather than using scientific sampling, it cant simply be scaled up to estimate a national figure. (Well also note that a full 81 percent of the employers that made cuts documented by his list are government entities; the share of private companies, which were the the focus of Puzders op-ed, accounted for just 19 percent of his list.) What all this means is that its easy build a scenario in which millions of workers could see their hours cut. But neither Puzder nor our own research has produced incontrovertible evidence that it has actually happened. What the data shows That said, its likely that the law is having some impact on part-time hours, albeit a smaller one than millions. • One study -- authored by Bowen Garrett of the Urban Institute and Robert Kaestner of the University of Illinois and published by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation -- found a modest (0.6 percentage-point) increase in the share of employees working part-time during the first seven months of 2014 compared to what would typically be expected based on previous economic recoveries. However, the authors attributed this finding to the dynamics of the recovery from the Great Recession, rather than to the Affordable Care Act. Ultimately, they found little change during the run-up to the implementation of the employer mandate -- an indication that the provision wasnt having a big effect on pushing workers involuntarily into part-time work. • Another study, by Helene Jorgensen and Dean Baker of the liberal Center for Economic and Policy Research, did find a small rise in the share of employees working 25 to 29 hours a week during the first half of 2013 -- but this bump came at the expense of those working fewer than 25 hours a week, not at the expense of those working 30 or more hours a week. Thats not the dynamic one would expect if Obamacare was pushing employers to cut hours. • Neither of the previous two studies offered hard estimates of how many workers saw their hours cut. But one analysis did -- one written by Ben Casselman, the chief economics writer at the website fivethirtyeight.com. When Casselman looked at the data, he found that the proportion of part-time workers working just below 30 hours a week had been rising for about two years, while the share working just over 30 hours was falling. Thats consistent with the trend Puzder pointed to. Heres a chart that accompanied his story:  Overall, Casselman concluded that the health law has likely led a few hundred thousand workers to see their hours cut or capped. Thats small in the context of an economy with 150 million workers. But it isnt a minor issue for those workers. Most of them are among the economys most vulnerable: low-wage, part-time workers who likely have few other options. Several economists we checked with said Casselmans estimate of a few hundred thousand was more plausible than Puzders millions. I think we can safely say that at this point it's clearly not millions, because that size shift would be noticeable in the aggregate data, said Tara Sinclair, a George Washington University economist.  A few hundred thousand seems a lot more plausible. Its worth noting that Casselmans a few hundred thousand and Puzders millions are not apples-to-apples figures. Casselman included employees who were already working part-time when their hours were cut, not just those who (as Puzder wrote) saw their full-time jobs shrink to part-time jobs. So Casselmans figure may actually overstate the number of employees who saw their jobs specifically shift from full-time to part-time. That makes it even harder to reach the millions threshold. Possible benefits Finally, several of the economists told us that focusing only on the negative aspects of Obamacare-inspired changes in working hours painted an incomplete picture. While its true that the law hurts employees who would like to work longer hours, the law also aids unemployed workers who are only too happy to work in newly created part-time jobs, as well as older workers who would like to retire but havent yet reached Medicare age and individuals who prefer part-time work and no longer have to take full-time jobs in order to secure health insurance. Indeed, the law makes it easier for Americans to start businesses on their own, since they are able to leave jobs where they work for someone else and still be able to secure affordable health care for themselves and their families. And it may be having that effect: Baker noticed that during the final quarter of 2014, the number of self-employed Americans rose by a whopping 400,000 compared to the previous years fourth quarter. Those 400,000 jobs are not counted in the widely reported BLS job-creation numbers, which only survey companies with payrolls. Our ruling Puzder said that Obamacare has caused millions of full-time jobs to become part-time. The statistics, in this case, are inadequate to either prove or disprove that millions of Americans have seen their job go from full-time to part-time due to the law. That number is possible, but unsupported. That said, theres evidence suggesting that hundreds of thousands of workers may have seen their hours cut as the laws impact began to be felt. Thats not millions, but its not insignificant either."
866,half-true,George LeMieux,(George) LeMieux never requested a single earmark and pushed to ban them all.,"A new Web ad from the campaign for former Sen. George LeMieux claims there's a big difference between him and Democratic U.S. Sen. Bill Nelson on the issue of earmarks.A narrator in the ad, called The Choice, says, Nelson voted for billions in wasteful spending earmarks like the Bridge to Nowhere. LeMieux never requested a single earmark and pushed to ban them all.We broke this claim into two fact-checks. In a separate item, we explore the claim that, Nelson voted for billions in wasteful spending earmarks like the Bridge to Nowhere.  In this item, we will address the second half of the equation, the claim that, LeMieux never requested a single earmark and pushed to ban them all.While this is technically true, the contrast isn't as black-and-white as the ad suggests.Here's why:LeMieux was appointed to the Senate by then-Florida Gov. Charlie Crist to fill the remaining term of retiring Sen. Mel Martinez. LeMieux took office on Sept. 10, 2009, and served until Jan. 3, 2011.Soon after taking office, LeMieux voted in favor of a handful of appropriations bills that included thousands of earmarks worth billions of dollars.We'll break it down.On Oct. 15, 2009, LeMieux voted in favor of an appropriations bill for energy and water development and related agencies for the 2010 fiscal year. According to a Congressional Research Service report, the bill included 2,293 earmarks at a cost of $5.7 billion.On Oct. 6, 2009, and Dec. 19, 2009, LeMieux voted in favor of appropriations bills for the Department of Defense. They included 1,719 earmarks at a cost of $4.2 billion.On Oct. 20, 2009, LeMieux voted in favor of an appropriations bill for the Department of Homeland Security. It included 192 earmarks at a cost of $420 million.On Nov. 5, 2009, LeMieux voted in favor of an appropriations bill for Commerce, Justice, Science and related agencies. The bill included 1,513 earmarks at a cost of $781 million.On Nov. 17, LeMieux voted in favor of an appropriations bill for military construction and veterans affairs. It included 745 earmarks at a cost of $14.5 billion.In other words, LeMieux voted for bills containing billions of dollars in earmarks, the very thing the ad criticized Nelson for in the previous sentence.But the ad is artfully worded. It doesn't say LeMieux never voted for an earmark, it says he never requested a single one.That's true, but it's also true that earmarks bound for Florida were already packed into the appropriations bills before LeMieux took over for Martinez. We checked the earmark database for the 2010 fiscal year compiled by Taxpayers for Common Sense -- a group that tracks federal earmarks -- and found several dozen earmarks at a cost of hundreds of millions of dollars requested by Martinez (sometimes jointly requested with Nelson and others) for various Florida projects, which were included in the appropriations bills that LeMieux voted for. We didn't find any evidence that LeMieux tried to remove those Florida earmarks.We asked LeMieux about those votes via e-mail.I never requested an earmark, LeMieux said. It became clear to me after my first couple months in D.C., and those first appropriation bills, that earmarks are the engine that drive the train of increased spending. After that experience I had a press conference with Sens. DeMint, Graham and others pledging not to seek an earmark.In that press conference, the Republican legislators called for a one-year moratorium on all earmarks.Let me tell you why I think earmarks are a problem, LeMieux said at the press conference. They're not just a problem for the amount of the budget that they are, because it's not a huge amount. They are a problem because they are the enabler.In my short time here, I have seen that if you ask for a project and you bring it back for your home state, then when the budget that they bring before you on a particular appropriations bill is 10 percent, 15 percent, 20 percent, 25 percent more than last year, you can't vote against it or you'll never get another project again. So I haven't done earmarks since I've been here, and I made a decision last month not to do them for the rest of the time I'm here, because the nation is in dire financial straits.So there's no question LeMieux pushed to ban earmarks, as the ad claims. But to back up that point, the ad cites LeMieux's vote on Nov. 30, 2010, in favor of an amendment that sought to establish a moratorium on earmarks through the 2013 fiscal year. The amendment failed with 39 senators voting in favor (including LeMieux) and 56 against. But here's what the ad doesn't say: Nelson also voted for the moratorium.Sen. Nelson may have voted to ban all earmarks, but he still sought them and still supports them, LeMieux wrote to us in an e-mail. My vote was sincere.Also, LeMieux stated, I have signed a pledge not to seek any earmarks if I have the honor of serving again.We contacted Nelson's press office for comment but did not hear back.Again, the wording of the earmark claims in LeMieux's ad are technically true. LeMieux has not personally requested any earmarks, and he has pushed to ban them all. But we think it's a bit hypocritical for LeMieux to call out Nelson for voting for a bill that included billions of dollars worth of earmarks (and specifically the infamous Bridge to Nowhere).LeMieux also voted for bills that included thousands of earmarks worth billions of dollars. By the same logic in LeMieux's ad, Nelson could counter with an ad that says LeMieux voted for billions in earmarks including any number of outrageous-sounding pet projects from around the country that were included in the handful of appropriations bills LeMieux voted for in late 2009.LeMieux makes the distinction that he never personally requested earmarks (while Nelson certainly has). But again, we think it's worth noting that the appropriations bills LeMieux voted in favor of were stuffed with dozens of Florida earmarks -- costing hundreds of millions of dollars -- that were requested by his Republican predecessor, Martinez. LeMieux has put himself out front on the issue of reining in earmarks, taking a stand early in 2010 calling for a complete ban. And LeMieux may not buy that Nelson has found religion on earmarks, but Nelson was among only a half dozen Democrats in the Senate who also voted for the earmark moratorium."
17211,half-true,Ohio Democratic Party,"Cuts in local government and school funding in John Kasichs budget caused many communities to seek school levies, local tax increases, layoffs.","After a recent appearance on NBC's Meet the Press in which Gov. John Kasich said he had balanced Ohio's budget and cut taxes, the Ohio Democratic Party issued a statement that his budget had negative consequences for local communities.Kasich slashed local government and school funding to the bone, the statement said, causing many communities to seek school levies, local tax increases, layoffs to offset budget cuts.PolitiFact Ohio decided to check out the claim.The governor's office answered with its own statement. It said the number of local government workers in Ohio has increased under Kasich after decreasing under his Democratic predecessor, Ted Strickland, and that the number of local tax issues has declined.PolitiFact Ohio was intrigued. Kasich and other Republicans often talk about shrinking the size of government. We found he was accurate, three months ago, when he said the number of state workers in Ohio had gone down.So it was something like a man bites dog story for him to boast that local government employment increased on his watch after declining under a Democratic administration.Kasich's spokesman referred us to the employment database of the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics.It showed that the number of local government workers in Ohio in July 2011, when the Kasich budget went into effect, was 520,600. It was 526,200 in preliminary numbers for May, the most recent number available -- an increase of 5,600 workers.The number stood at 554,700 in July 2007, when the first Strickland budget went into effect, and 523,400 in June 2011 -- a decrease of 31,300.The decrease continued until last January, when it reached 520,000, the lowest level since 1999. The peak of local government employment in Ohio was 560,600, reached in July 2004, according to the BLS.Kasich spokesman Rob Nichols also pointed to the local election tallies on the Ohio secretary of state website. The figures show tax issues were at the lowest levels since 2003, he said, countering the claim that Kasich's budget led to local tax increases.We looked, though we find it difficult to draw any conclusions about local finances from a simple count of the number of tax issues on local ballots. For consistency of comparison, we looked at November general-election tallies. (There has been one November general election and one spring primary since Kasich's budget went into effect.)What we found was a general consistency in the number of tax issues: a total of 1,009 last November; 1,059 in November 2010; 1,100 in November 2009; 1,053 in November 2008, and 995 in 2007 -- the lowest level in the years for which a local issues summary was available.Kasich's two-year budget, signed a year ago, cut state funding for local governments by about $630 million over the two years, and cut funding for schools by about $700 million. The governor challenged local governments to be more efficient and creative to deal with the cuts without raising taxes.Ohio Democratic Party Spokesman Jerid Kurtz cited 10 municipalities and school districts looking at layoffs and tax hikes that officials blamed on the funding cuts.One was the city of Lima. Its finance director said it had a balanced budget as recently as 2008, but faced a $2 million deficit in its general fund, largely because of state budget cuts, despite reducing the general fund consistently for the past 10 years, the Lima News reported.Another was Sycamore Township, near Cincinnati. It laid off most of its firefighters in May 2012 because, township officials said, state budget cuts would eliminate half of the community's general fund revenue.A third was the Berea school district, which passed a 3.9-mill operating levy in March 2012 after reducing its budget by $5.1 million for reasons that included the loss of state dollars.According to the Ohio School Boards Association, school levies passed in March 2012 at an exceptionally high rate of 74 percent, the highest level since November 2000. The usual passage rate for school levies in Ohio is about 54 percent, the group said.The growth in local government employment is more likely due to the Ohio recovery that began a full year before Kasich took office, Kurtz said. There is absolutely no proof Kasich's budget is the cause.Seeking further perspective, we called the Ohio Municipal League, which lobbies for cities and villages. Communications director Kent Scarrett said he certainly agreed there is more of an uptick in school levies because of state funding cuts, and said the full impact has not yet been felt.The biggest cuts in direct payments to municipalities through the Local Government Fund will come in year two of Kasich's budget in 2013. The elimination of the estate tax in 2013, which is also part of the budget, will further reduce revenue to local governments.They're going to be up against it next year, Scarrett said. In 2013 the cuts are going to be much more profound. It's kind of scary.That's looking into the future, which we won't do.Let's get back to the statement we're checking: Kasich slashed local government and school funding to the bone, causing many communities to seek tax increases and lay off workers.The claim is partially accurate.Kasich's budget did cut funding for local governments significantly. Some school districts and municipalities have sought, considered or passed tax issues to deal with budget shortfalls to which the funding cuts have contributed. And the Ohio Democrats can provide anecdotal evidence that some budget shortfalls have threatened or led to layoffs.But the claim also overlooks important details that give the it context.The number of local government jobs in Ohio has actually increased since Kasich's budget was enacted, after dipping to a 12-year low. And the number of local tax issues to appear on ballots across Ohio has been steady for several years.Further, one of the outside experts we talked to says it is too soon to tell the full impact of cuts in funding because the biggest cuts through the Local Government Fund havent kicked in yet, nor has the elimination of the estate tax.On the Truth-O-Meter, the claim rates Half True."
13383,half-true,Ken Cuccinelli,Says Virginia saved $300 million by rebidding a Metrorail construction project to exclude guaranteed union contracts.,"GOP gubernatorial nominee Ken Cuccinelli says Democrat Terry McAuliffe will drive up transportation costs by steering road and rail construction contracts to labor unions. For proof, Cuccinelli has been describing Virginias experience this year soliciting bids for a construction phase of the Metrorails new Silver Line that will provide subway service from Washington to Dulles Airport in Loudoun County.  I keep trying to come back to transportation and spending for transportation and when youve got the kind of union ties (McAuliffe) does, thats a concern, Cuccinelli said during a July 29 radio interview on the John Fredericks Show. I mean, the one specific example is in Northern Virginia where the governor forced the rebidding of half of one transportation project -- the Metro extension -- because they had done that with Project Labor Agreements. These are guaranteed labor contracts and the governor said, `If you want to get state money (for the project), youve got to rebid those contracts. So they did and the price came down $300 million. Gov. McAuliffe wont force the rebidding of guaranteed union contracts and Gov. Cuccinelli will, he said. Cuccinelli made the same claim during a July 20 debate with McAuliffe. So we decided to examine his contention that $300 million was saved by rebidding the contract without the union-friendly provision. Lets start with some background. Construction of the 23-mile Silver Line began in early 2009. Phase 1, a $2.7 billion extension of Northern Virginia subway lines from Falls Church to past Tysons Corner, is expected to be completed this year. Work on Phase 2, an 11-mile expansion to Dulles Airport and slightly beyond, is scheduled to start next year and be finished in 2018. The Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority is managing the project and last year estimated the second phase would also cost $2.7 billion. In April 2010, the MWAA Board of Directors ordered a Project Labor Agreement that would allow construction unions to determine the wages, benefits and employment conditions for all Phase 2 laborers -- whether they belonged to a union or not. The action was denounced by the state chapter of Associated Builders and Contractors and many Republican politicians, including Cuccinelli and Gov. Bob McDonnell, who said the agreement would elevate costs to depress bidding competition for Phase 2. Critics also said the agreement was inconsistent with the states libertarian culture, pointing to an academic study that found 95 percent of private-company construction workers in Virginia last year were non-union. Virginia is one of 24 states with a right-to-work law that bars compulsory union membership.  In April 2012, McDonnell signed a bill banning state aid to projects requiring a Project Labor Agreement. Two months later, the MWAA rescinded the union-friendly policy. Now, lets return to Cuccinellis claim that after the agreement was dropped, Phase 2 was rebid and taxpayers saved $300 million. Cuccinellis campaign defended the claim by sending us a May 2013 news release from the MWAA announcing its awarding of a construction contract for roughly half of the work in Phase 2. But there has been no rebidding in Phase 2, according to Transportation Secretary Sean Connaughton, so any savings from eliminating the union agreement is conjecture. The MWAA originally estimated that the contract it put out this spring would come in at between $1.4 billion to $1.6 billion, but Capital Rail Constructors submitted a winning bid of $1.18 billion. Thats the basis of the savings Cuccinelli claims: A range of $222 million to $422 million compared to the original estimates. Connaughton said he believes the elimination of the union agreement reduced costs -- although he didnt know by how much -- because it encouraged contractors weary of unions to bid on the contract. That expanded competition and bidders sharpened their pencils, he said. Debate over the value of Planned Labor Agreements goes far beyond Virginia and there are many defenders of the arrangements. The Laborers International Union of North America pointed us to a report from Cornell University professor Fred Kotler that says PLAs have saved money on New York projects because they establish predictable costs, guarantee standards of excellence and management rights, and give contractors flexibility on starting times. A few final notes: Cuccinelli said that McAuliffe, if he was governor, would back union-guaranteed contracts. McAuliffe, in June, declined to say whether he supports such agreements. McAuliffe has reaped almost $1.2 million in contributions from organized labor this year, prompting Cuccinelli to portray him as a pawn for unions. Cuccinelli, in contrast, has received only $250 from unions. In July, we gave a False rating to a Cuccinelli claim that McAuliffe opposes Virginias right-to-work law. Our ruling Cuccinelli says Virginia saved $300 million by rebidding a Dulles Metrorail contract without a union-friendly agreement. But the project was not re-bid -- the savings was a reflection of preliminary construction estimates compared to the winning bid made by a contractor. The states transportation secretary believes that eliminating a requirement for union contracts expanded bidding competition and led to savings, but says theres no way of knowing how much. The basis of Cuccinellis statement has merit; Virginia did force the repeal of the union requirement and project bids came in lower than expected. But he twists facts to suggest there was a tangible $300 million savings in killing the union agreement. "
11271,half-true,Maria Cantwell,7 million more Americans are uninsured now than when President Trump was elected.,"Concern over health insurance helped Democrats take back the House of Representatives in the 2018 elections. And the issue remains a potent one for the party. In a Jan. 23 tweet, Sen. Maria Cantwell, D-Wash., sent out a image that said, 7 million more Americans are uninsured now than when President Trump was elected. The percentage of Americans without health insurance is at its highest since 2014, and 7 million more Americans are uninsured now than when President Trump was elected.We should be working to expand access to affordable #healthcare, not cut it off. pic.twitter.com/aRWCINCjm5 Cantwells tweet included the source -- Gallups National Health and Well-Being Index. However, her tweet didnt mention that two widely respected federal studies show much less erosion in insurance coverage since Trump was elected in 2016. Lets take a look at the numbers. In its National Health and Well-Being Index, the survey firm Gallup publishes quarterly data on how many Americans lack health insurance. To arrive at its numbers, the firm surveys approximately 10,000 U.S. adults aged 18 and older each month. Heres a chart Gallup put together showing the historical trend for the uninsured rate in recent years:  In its release of its findings for the fourth quarter of 2018, Gallup wrote, Today's level is the highest in more than four years, and well above the low point of 10.9 percent reached in 2016. The 2.8-percentage-point increase since that low represents a net increase of about seven million adults without health insurance. That parallels what Cantwell tweeted. However, Gallups data shows the most extreme rise in the uninsured rate; other data shows relatively little change. • The Census Bureaus Health Insurance Coverage in the United States: 2017 showed an increase of the uninsured of 492,000 people between 2017 and 2016. Thats a rise, but its about one-fourteenth as large as the one Cantwell cited. Heres the historical trend line for the Census Bureaus study:  • The National Health Interview Survey, undertaken by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, actually found a decline of 300,000 uninsured Americans between 2016 and the first quarter of 2018, if you measure by uninsured at the time of interview, which is the closest comparison to Gallups data. If you instead use uninsured for at least part of the past year -- a different statistic the CDCs survey collected -- there was essentially no change in the ranks of the uninsured over that period. Here are the long-term historical figures for the CDC study:  Its worth noting that the various studies have some differences in methodology. Every survey that measures health insurance coverage and the uninsured comes out with somewhat different answers, said Linda Blumberg, a health-policy specialist at the Urban Institute. They all have different questions, different ordering of questions within the survey, different sample sizes, and different sampling frames. For instance, the CDC survey doesnt include adults over 65, whereas Gallup does. Perhaps the most important advantage for the Gallup data is that it includes the most current data of the three -- a factor that Bryan Watt, a spokesman for Cantwell, cited in an interview with PolitiFact Watt also pointed to another non-governmental survey, undertaken by the Commonwealth Fund, that shows an increase in the uninsured rate since 2016, a finding thats consistent with what Gallup found. The Commonwealth Fund survey reported that the uninsured rate for non-elderly adults was 12.7 percent in February-April 2016, 14.0 percent in March-June 2017, and 15.5 percent in February-March 2018. Still, Blumberg said there are reasons to rely on the governmental studies, particularly the one published by the CDC. Gallup is more recent, but they also show larger changes than the NHIS in recent years, she said. The CDC study has a higher response rate, and it has been transparent as to whether any questions or data collection methodology has changed. Given the differences in the way these surveys are measuring changes in the number of uninsured, its probably best to acknowledge that and be careful not to draw conclusions too quickly, Blumberg said. Gail Wilensky, who headed Medicare and Medicaid under President George H.W. Bush, agreed. We will know more when the Census Bureau or the CDC put out updated estimates, she said. In the meantime, politicians should hold their fire. Cantwell tweeted, 7 million more Americans are uninsured now than when President Trump was elected. The tweet cites one study of health insurance coverage, the one undertaken by Gallup. However, she ignores two closely watched government studies that showed much smaller changes in uninsured Americans, and in one instance, actually found a modest reduction in the number of people without insurance."
16188,half-true,Todd Staples,"Savings that I achieved helped fund cameras on the border. As a result, more than 21,500 arrests have been made and 46 tons of narcotics confiscated.","Lieutenant governor candidate Todd Staples says he not only has a plan that addresses border security, hes already tackled the challenge. Staples, Texas agriculture commissioner, wrote in a Jan. 13, 2014, campaign email blast, Using cost savings that I achieved from cutting government waste, I helped fund Operation Drawbridge, a low-cost, high-tech, DPS-led operation that placed game cameras along the border to detect illegal trafficking. As a result, more than 21,500 arrests have been made and 46 tons of narcotics confiscated. The Texas Department of Agriculture indeed approved aid for Operation Drawbridge, we learned, but the multimillion-dollar Department of Public Safety project had already been in place for most of a year. Also, Staples cited arrest and confiscation totals reflected Drawbridges overall results. In an interview, Staples told us his statement was intended to reflect totals for the entire program and hes never said all the results were due to Agriculture Department aid. Staples also stressed that his email blast said the agencys savings helped achieve the results. I dont want to get popped for something Ive never taken credit for, he said. Operation Drawbridge The states Department of Public Safety started Drawbridge in January 2012, according to its website. DPS spokesman Tom Vinger told us by email that Agriculture Department grants in October 2012 and August 2013 provided $345,000 to the program. The main source of Drawbridge funding, Vinger said, is the Criminal Justice Division of the Governors Office, which has so far provided grants totaling $2.5 million. A description of the initiative from a June 9, 2012, San Antonio Express-News news story said, (T)he department is installing 500 cameras along the border, part of an electronic monitoring program called Operation Drawbridge. It's an update of the much-criticized Texas Border Watch Program, a multimillion-dollar effort by the state to set up video cameras along the border. It was recently canceled after only a few dozen cameras were put in place over more than three years and unimpressive results. A 2013 DPS conference presentation placed online illustrates how Drawbridge uses modified off-the-shelf, motion-sensing, low-light cameras of the type hunters use to spot and track game at all hours. Farmers and ranchers volunteer to have the $300 cameras placed on their land near the Texas/Mexico border. Once an image is captured, software transmits it to law enforcement, and response times can be as quick as 10 minutes, according to the presentation.   Images from 2013 conference presentation on DPS website preparingtexas.org  Staples has long warned that because of a lack of border security, farmers and ranchers are under siege. His campaign spokesman, Bryan Black, told us via email that Staples helped bring landowner organizations into Operation Drawbridge. Staples told us his involvement with border security issues arose in response to landowners asking him for help. Savings to buy cameras Black said the grants came from agency savings in fiscal year 2013. Agriculture Department spokeswoman Lindsey Pope emailed us a chart with the agencys lapsed appropriations, money budgeted by lawmakers but ultimately unspent, in each biennium from 2006-07 through 2012-13. It showed the total returned to the state treasury in 2012-13 was $10.3 million. DPS spokesman Vinger sent us web links to his agencys Oct. 11, 2012, press release on the $225,000 grant and Aug. 8, 2013, release on the $120,000 grant. The 2012 release said, Operation Drawbridge is fully operational today with hundreds of cameras located along the border. This funding will essentially double the number of cameras involved in the program. Drawbridge was operating 750 cameras as of June 30, 2013, according to the online DPS presentation. Legislative Budget Board staff spokesman John Barton emailed us a Sept. 28, 2012, grant agreement between the agencies stating that the $225,000 grant was for the funding of additional DPS remote motion-sensing cameras, installation and monitoring activities associated with the surveillance along the border, particularly in those areas of the Texas-Mexico border where illegal activity and border violence have adversely affected rural landowners and the Texas agriculture industry. An Aug. 8, 2013, McAllen Monitor news story said, The $120,000 grant is for DPS to expand the program by purchasing more motion-sensing cameras. Arrests and confiscations From January 2012 through December 2013, according to Vinger and the DPS website, Drawbridge resulted in the apprehension of more than 22,950 individuals and more than 50 tons of narcotics. The October 2012 press release announcing the first Department of Agriculture grant said Drawbridge had resulted in the apprehension of approximately 4,000 individuals and 10 tons of narcotics since January 2012. So it would appear that at least 18,950 people and 40 tons of narcotics were captured from Oct. 11, 2012, through Dec. 31, 2013. Some supporting detail comes from the 2013 DPS conference presentation:   Our ruling Staples said savings he achieved helped fund cameras on the border and that as a result, more than 21,500 arrests were made and 46 tons of narcotics were confiscated. This statement could leave the misleading impression that a few hundred thousand dollars committed on Staples watch to an established program near the border culminated in the touted arrests and confiscations. Its documented that the grant money supported the border effort. But we dont see a way to tie particular arrests and confiscations to the grants. Also, this statement leaves out the critical fact that about 90 percent of the operations funding has come from federal aid awarded through the governors office.

19364,half-true,Van Wanggaard,You're more likely to be the victim of a violent crime in Milwaukee than in 96 percent of the country.,"Resentment and recrimination often characterize political relations between Milwaukee and the rest of Wisconsin. In the latest clash, the Milwaukee Public Schools board thwarted an effort by Republican state lawmakers to reform the low-performing district. That led the GOP leader of the Senate to say the Legislature might respond by cutting the districts funding. About two weeks later, on July 10, 2016, another GOP lawmaker issued a broadside against largely Democratic Milwaukee. State Sen. Van Wanggaard of Racine wrote an opinion piece in the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel that was laden with statistical claims unfavorable to the city -- including one making a national comparison about crime that we want to check. Recent complaints from Milwaukee leaders about their lack of state funding are misguided and lack perspective, the column began. Unfortunately, Wanggaard later wrote, the only way to cut this expenditure is to reduce the number of people needing assistance — reducing poverty. But the failing school system and Milwaukee's crime problem prevent that. Then came the claim were interested in, with Wanggaard saying you're more likely to be the victim of a violent crime in Milwaukee than in 96 percent of the country. Milwaukee is known for a relatively high violent crime rate. But this way of expressing that has some problems. Trends in violent crime Across the country, crime has been on a downward trend. Thats what PolitiFact National reported in June 2016 in rating as Pants on Fire Donald Trumps claim that crime is rising. With regard to violent crime, our colleagues checked FBI figures through 2014, the latest year for which complete figures are available. They found that nationally, the rates of violent crime per 100,000 people have been falling on an almost uninterrupted basis since the early 1990s. As counted by the FBIs Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR), violent crime includes murder, rape, robbery and aggravated assault. Milwaukees violent crime rate has been among the highest among large cities. In 2014, there were 8,864 violent crimes reported in the city, according to the FBI figures. That was up 8 percent from 8,194 in 2013. Now, to Wanggaards claim. Wanggaards evidence To back the statement, Wanggaards staff cited rankings from two websites that rank places to live. Each used the FBIs UCR violent crime figures for 2014. AreaVibes.com says Milwaukee is safer than 4 percent of the cities in the United States. Another way to say that would be that Milwaukees violent crime rate is higher than 96 percent of the country. NeighborhoodScout.com says the figure is 3 percent. Michael OHear, a law professor at Marquette University in Milwaukee, told us the rankings give some basis for Wanggaards 96 percent claim. But OHear and other criminal justice experts told us there are problems with the claim. Its sort of a dubious measure on so many grounds, said Alfred Blumstein, an emeritus professor of urban systems and operations research Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh. Comparison problems 1. UCR figures are solid. But the FBI strongly discourages using them to make rankings to evaluate different communities, saying: These incomplete analyses have often created misleading perceptions which adversely affect geographic entities and their residents. For this reason, the FBI has a long-standing policy against ranking participating law enforcement agencies on the basis of crime data alone  many factors cause the nature and type of crime to vary from place to place. 2. Across the country, violent crime generally is concentrated in larger cities, so it stands to reason there is less violent crime in most parts of the country. But the figures used in the website rankings compare Milwaukee with cities such as Mount Pleasant near Racine (15 violent crimes in 2014)and Sun Prairie (32) near Madison that have a population as low as 25,000. Theres a world of difference between a city of 25,000 and a city the size of Milwaukee (population 600,000), OHear said. 3. Violent crime in Milwaukee is concentrated in certain neighborhoods, while other neighborhoods carry no more risk of violent crime than many suburban neighborhoods. In other words, youre not suddenly at great risk of being a violent crime victim simply by crossing the city limits. Usually if youre not hanging out in high-crime neighborhoods, your chances of being a victim of crime are pretty low, said Michael Jacobson, executive director of the City University of New York Institute for State & Local Governance. Our rating Wanggaard said: You're more likely to be the victim of a violent crime in Milwaukee than in 96 percent of the country. Three rankings using violent crime rates from the FBI give Milwaukee such a ranking. But the FBI warns against using its figures to do rankings; the rankings compare Milwaukee to relatively tiny cities; and the claim makes a broad claim about Milwaukee but ignores the fact that most violent crime in the city is limited to certain neighborhoods. For a statement that is partially accurate but takes things out of context, our rating is Half True."
11521,half-true,Facebook posts,"Fact: Mike Bloomberg spent $12 million to re-elect a Senate Republican (Toomey) in 2016. Toomey beat the Dem (McGinty) by 1.5 points. If McGinty had won, Ds would have controlled the Senate after Doug Jones won and could have blocked Kavanaugh from the Supreme Court.","Mike Bloombergs past spending to help some Republican candidates has drawn the ire of Democrats, now that hes seeking to be their presidential nominee. But a Facebook post goes too far in linking his spending to help re-elect U.S. Sen. Pat Toomey, R-Pa., to the confirmation of U.S. Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh. In 2016, Toomey won a second term when he beat Democrat Katie McGinty, a former aide to Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Wolf and former environmental adviser to President Bill Clinton, by about 1.5 percentage points. Fact: Mike Bloomberg spent $12 million to re-elect a Senate Republican (Toomey) in 2016, stated the Facebook post. Toomey beat the Dem (McGinty) by 1.5 points. If McGinty had won, Ds would have controlled the Senate after Doug Jones won and could have blocked Kavanaugh from the Supreme Court. We found that Bloomberg did spend millions to help Toomey; whether that changed the outcome of the election is anybodys guess. But the post exaggerates when it says the race had the power to change the Supreme Court. The post was flagged as part of Facebooks efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Two ads by Bloombergs Independence USA PAC praised Toomey for crossing party lines to support background checks for gun buyers. Toomey backed legislation to expand checks to online sales and gun shows — a position shared by Bloomberg, who helped launch the gun control advocacy group Everytown for Gun Safety. A New York Times analysis of Bloombergs donations stated that he spent $11.7 million to support Toomey in 2016. Since 2012, the New York Times found, Bloomberg has helped candidates from both major parties, but his political committees have given more to Democrats than Republicans. We used the database of donations posted by the Center for Responsive Politics and found that Bloombergs Independence USA PAC spent $5.9 million in support of Toomey in 2016. As an individual, Bloomberg gave $2,700 to Toomeys campaign. The Pennsylvania U.S. Senate race was the most expensive general-election Senate contest in the nation in 2016, reaching a total of $170 million with candidate and outside spending combined. The Facebook post misleads when it states, if McGinty had won, Ds would have controlled the Senate after Doug Jones won. At the beginning of 115th Congress in January 2017, there were 52 Republicans, 46 Democrats and 2 independents who caucused with the Democrats. When Alabama Democrat Doug Jones took office in January 2018, that gave Republicans a 51-49 lead. If McGinty had won, the Senate would have ended up at 50-50. So who would have been in control? Washington University political scientist Steve Smith said that there are Senate precedents that allow the vice presidents party — in this case Mike Pence — to be treated as the majority party. When the 2000 elections produced a 50-50 tie and a Republican vice president, the two parties worked out a power-sharing agreement that provided for committees to be equally divided between the parties but with Republican chairs, Smith said. However the majority leader was the Republican leader. If the Senate found itself in another 50-50 split, that would lead to another round of negotiations. The Democrats would not control the Senate in the case of a 50-50 division, he said. To the contrary, some power sharing arrangement would again be negotiated and the term control, an informal term, really would not fit. If the vice president was Republican, the majority leader would be Republican. Now that brings us to the part of the Facebook post that said after Jones won, if McGinty had also won, the Democrats could have blocked Kavanaugh from the Supreme Court. This statement does have a qualifier of could, but if it assumes that a McGinty win alone could have changed the outcome. Thats misleading. The Senate voted 50-48 to confirm Kavanaugh in October 2018. U.S. Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia was the lone Democrat to vote in favor. If we take the hypothetical scenario of McGinty beating Toomey, and assume she would have followed Democratic Party lines, and all other senators would have voted in the same way as they actually did, the vote would have tied 49-49. That means that Pence could have cast a deciding vote. Other scenarios are equally hypothetical. A Facebook post said, Fact: Mike Bloomberg spent $12 million to re-elect a Senate Republican (Toomey) in 2016. Toomey beat a Dem (McGinty) by 1.5 points. If McGinty had won, Ds would have controlled the Senate after Doug Jones won and could have blocked Kavanaugh from the Supreme Court. Bloomberg did support Toomey and gave him significant funding. The rest of the claim is murky and relies on a hypothetical situation. Kavanaugh was confirmed in a 50-48 vote. If McGinty had won and all other things were the same, it likely would have ended up in a tie vote to be broken by Pence."
12296,half-true,David Axelrod,Says Newt Gingrich is responsible for the gridlocked politics of Washington.,"During an interview on the Dec. 5, 2011, edition of MSNBCs The Daily Rundown, David Axelrod, a senior campaign adviser to President Barack Obama, coined a new description for Republican presidential candidate and former House Speaker Newt Gingrich: the godfather of gridlock.Discussing a newly released Gingrich ad that portrays the former speaker in a soft light, Axelrod told host Chuck Todd that he was amused by the ad because he talked about (how) he was going to bring the country together to solve problems. You're talking about the godfather of gridlock here, the guy who two decades ago really invented the kind of tactics that have now become commonplace in Washington. So, this is a whole new Newt.We wondered whether it was really fair to pin todays policy gridlock on tactics engineered by Gingrich. So we sought comments from historians, political scientists and other political observers. We thought analyzing this quote might prove too subjective, but we found concrete evidence to both bolster and undermine Axelrod's claim. Gingrich the fighter Some historians and analysts say Gingrich's bare-knuckled tactics created a sharp partisanship that continues today.Gingrich came to national attention when he led a group of fellow backbenchers to challenge the ethics of House Speaker Jim Wright, D-Texas. Their challenge led Wright to resign in 1989, driving the ousted speaker to decry the mindless cannibalism consuming Congress.It was a watershed moment for Gingrich, and only solidified his belief that confrontation, not compromise, was what Congress needed.Beginning in 1989, Gingrich bided his time as House minority whip, serving under a more conciliatory Republican leader, Bob Michel of Illinois. By 1993 and 1994, -- when a Democratic president, Bill Clinton, was in the White House and the 40-year Democratic House majority was looking shaky -- Gingrich upped the ante.The Republican strategy in 1993 and 1994 was to vote as a parliamentary minority, in unison against the new president's initiatives, and that was as much or more Newt's idea as anybody's, said Norm Ornstein, a congressional scholar with the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank. Clinton's economic program, his first big initiative, took almost eight months to pass, denying him a big early victory and making the eventual passage look like a humiliation. The same approach had success with a crime bill and, of course, with health care reform.Michels impending retirement cleared the way for Gingrich to become speaker if the GOP managed to take over the House in the 1994 election. And they did.Once in office, Gingrich continued his confrontational strategy, most notably in the budget fights of 1995 that led to shutdowns of the federal government. Purdue University political scientist Bert A. Rockman cited Gingrich's defamatory misuse of the C-SPAN morning one-minute diatribes to an empty chamber, his over-the-top-rhetoric and his dogged pursuit of Clintons impeachment. Its become much worse, and for reasons hardly exclusive to any individuals nastiness, but Newt was a major contributor to the nastiness that prevails today.Gingrich developed wedge issues to divide the Democratic majority and magnets to pull voters into the Republican orbit, said Steve Gillon, a historian at the University of Oklahoma and author of The Pact: Bill Clinton, Newt Gingrich, and the Rivalry that Defined a Generation.University of Kansas political scientist Burdett Loomis argues that Gingrichs attacks on Congress itself have harmed the institution in the long term. Though Gingrich is a historian by training, Loomis said, he ignored the importance of maintaining (Congress) legitimacy, which has haunted us since.Gingrich the deal-makerBut Loomis and others also say Gingrich's legacy is not black and white. After Gingrich lost the public relations war over the shutdown to Clinton, he became more willing to compromise with his rival.What Axelrod's comment does not account for is the change that took place in Gingrich after the 1995 budget battle, Gillon said. Both Clinton and Gingrich realized they had more to gain by working together than they did by fighting each other. Both men saw their poll numbers rise.This period of cooperation lasted until the emergence of the Monica Lewinsky affair in 1998, which Gingrich played a significant role in promoting.So what did Clinton and Gingrich accomplish during this era of (relatively) good feelings? Here are a few notable bills, each of which passed with broad, bipartisan majorities.Telecommunications Act, 1996 -- described by the Federal Communications Commission as the first major overhaul of telecommunications law in almost 62 years. The House passed the final version of the bill by a 414-16 margin, with 236 Republicans and 178 Democrats supporting it.Welfare reform, 1996 -- a landmark bill to end cash payments and instead encourage recipients to find work. The House passed the final version of the bill by a 328-101 margin, with 230 Republicans and 98 Democrats.Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, 1996 -- a law that allowed people to change jobs without fearing the loss of their health insurance due to pre-existing conditions, as well as provisions dealing with health information privacy. The House passed the final version of the bill by a 421-2 margin, with 227 Republicans and 193 Democrats.Taxpayer Relief Act, 1997 -- which established a child tax credit, tuition tax credits, and penalty-free withdrawals from IRAs for education expenses and first-home purchases, as well as a decrease in the capital gains tax and limitations on the estate tax. The House passed the final version of the bill by a 389-43 margin, with 225 Republicans and 164 Democrats.Balanced Budget Act, 1997 -- a bill that cut spending in order to balance the budget by fiscal year 2002. The House passed the final version of the bill by a 346-85 margin, with 193 Republicans and 153 Democrats.At the presidential bill-signing ceremony on the South Lawn of the White House, Gingrich called for bipartisan leadership across the planet to put aside party differences and address other nagging problems that, like the deficit, worry the public, the Washington Times reported. We will meet the moral integrity test in peacetime of not spending our children's and grandchildren's money, he said. We have a chance over the next three and a half years to work together . . . to accomplish a lot.Overall, Newts four years as speaker can be characterized as gridlock followed by greased wheels, said Donald Wolfensberger, who served as the Republican staff director of the influential House Rules Committee before and during Gingrichs tenure as speaker. Wolfensberger is now director of the Congress Project at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars.Alan Abramowitz, an Emory University political scientist, agreed, and added that the Senate -- long the home of blocked nomination hearings and a filibuster rule that allows one senator to stand in the way of legislation -- has been at least as much a force for gridlock in Washington as the House. The Senate deserves far more blame for gridlock than the House, Abramowitz said.So Gingrich has been more of a prince of partisanship than a godfather of gridlock.Axelrod is mixing up apples and oranges, said John Feehery, a longtime House Republican spokesman who worked under then-House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., among others. Intense partisanship does not necessarily lead to gridlock, and gridlock is not necessarily the result of partisanship.Gillon, who wrote the book on the Clinton-Gingrich relationship, calls the former speaker a very complicated figure. He is a man who will use the most ruthless methods in order to gain power, but who can be restrained, creative, and bipartisan once he has power... The political people in the Clinton White House viewed Gingrich as the antichrist. But many of the policy people – Chief of Staff Leon Panetta, domestic policy adviser Bruce Reed, Chief of Staff Erskine Bowles – painted a portrait of a pragmatic, though temperamental, policymaker.Our rulingSo while Gingrich was sharply partisan, there are solid examples where he short-circuited gridlock to push bills to enactment."
17328,half-true,Chris Coons,"Obamacare granted the protection against preexisting condition discrimination that extended to more than 150 million Americans, folks who get their health insurance through their employer.","During a recent appearance on MSNBC, Sen. Chris Coons (D-Del.) answered questions from Morning Joe co-host Mika Brzezinski about the latest lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of the Affordable Care Act. The most important part of Obamacare, as you know, Mika, is the protection against preexisting condition discrimination that extended to more than 150 million Americans, folks who get their health insurance through their employer, he said. Because, as almost everyone agrees, health care is complicated, we decided to take a closer look at Coons statement, especially because much has been written and said — and put in campaign ads — about how many Americans have preexisting health conditions and how they gained insurance protections under the ACA. We will not attempt to judge Sen. Coons assertion that the ACAs protection for people with preexisting conditions is the most important part of the law, although it is often mentioned along with the expansion of Medicaid to millions more Americans with low incomes. We started out by contacting Coons office to get the background information on his assertion, but didnt hear back. So, we moved on to examining the statutes and talking to various experts. First came HIPAA What we found out is what few people realize: Protections for preexisting conditions for most people with job-based insurance predated the ACA by more than a decade. The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, is best known for its provisions regarding medical privacy and patient access to their medical records. But the principal purpose of the law was to put an end to what was known as job lock. That happened when people with preexisting health conditions were afraid to leave one job with insurance for another job with insurance because the new insurance would not cover their condition, or would impose long waiting periods. HIPAA was a big advancement at the time in terms of protecting people with preexisting conditions who had employer coverage, said Sabrina Corlette, a research professor who studies health insurance at Georgetown University. Specifically, HIPAA required that as long as someone had been continuously covered by health insurance for at least 12 months, without a break longer than 63 days, new insurance at a new job could not impose waiting periods for a worker or family member. HIPAA also required insurers who sold policies in the small-group market to sell to all small groups, regardless of health status, and to cover every eligible member of the group, also regardless of health status. Most of the states had already attempted to address the job-lock problem by the mid-1990s, but states could not reach the majority of the population with health insurance because they were covered by the federal Employee Retirement Income Security Act, or ERISA. HIPAA basically ratified what most states had already done, said Joel Ario, a former Pennsylvania state insurance commissioner who helped implement the ACA for the federal government. HIPAA also tried to smooth the transition from employer-based insurance to individual coverage by requiring insurers to offer coverage to people who exhausted their post-employment COBRA benefits. (COBRA, short for the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act, was a 1986 law that allowed workers to continue to purchase their employer plans at full cost for up to 18 months.) But HIPAA did not address how much insurers could charge for those plans, and many insurance companies tried to deter enrollment by making premiums unaffordable for nearly anyone who qualified. While the group-to-individual conversion problem was the most glaring gap in HIPAA, it was not the only one. HIPAA did not require employers to offer health coverage nor did it require those who did offer coverage to offer a minimum package of benefits. Most of those gaps were addressed by the ACA. It effectively required large employers to provide a minimum package of benefits (or else pay a substantial fine). The ACA also, for the first time, required insurers to sell policies to individuals with preexisting conditions — without charging them more. Much of HIPAA was written into the health law, making the relationship between the two measures even more complicated. Our ruling In this statement, Coons suggested that that ACA provided pre-existing condition protections to the more than 150 million Americans who get their health coverage through their place of employment. But that is not completely correct.Those were already in place through HIPAA, though expanded by the ACA."
13769,half-true,Wannabe Entertainment,LeBrons I Promise School To Cost Taxpayers Millions Of Dollars Every Year,"An entertainment blog took a shot at LeBron James for not paying a fair share of the cost of his I Promise School in Akron, Ohio. Wannabe Entertainment published a story criticizing national media for not acknowledging that James isnt paying for the bulk of the schools costs. Its headline paints taxpayers as bearers of the burden for the school, which opened July 30. LeBrons I Promise School To Cost Taxpayers Millions Of Dollars Every Year, it says. Wannabe Entertainment is correct that taxpayers will pay millions of dollars for the school. However, the framing of the article could mislead readers to believe taxpayers will pay millions of dollars on top of what they were paying before, which is not the case. The first few paragraphs of the story are lifted straight from an Aug. 5 Cleveland Plain Dealer story. After that, the Wannabe Entertainment story switches to a diatribeabout Trump's tweeted critique of James and CNN's Don Lemon after an interview and the entire anti-Trump universe coming to the basketball star's defense. Its versiondoes not go on, as the Plain Dealer did, to credit James's investment. The I Promise School is a first-through-eighth grade public school that is part of the Akron Public School District. Because it is a public school, the LeBron James Family Foundation will foot a portion of the cost, but not the entire bill. This is a public school, Akron Public Schools spokesman Mark Williamson told PolitiFact. Taxpayers support all of our schools including this one. Public schools are funded by the state, property taxes and federal funds. So by law, the LeBron James Family Foundation cannot fully fund the school if it wanted to. The foundation pays for the additional services at the school that the other schools in the district do not have, including GED classes and job placement for parents, guest speakers and a food pantry. Stephanie Rosa, a spokeswoman for the LeBron James Family Foundation, told PolitiFact the foundation hasnt added up how much it contributed to the school. A $2 million rough estimate covered some building renovations, such as rewiring for technologyand staff hires for the family center. But the amount of money spent up until the day the school opened has not been made public. Before the opening of Jamess school, the I Promise program had been in Akron elementary schools for more than 10 years. There are 32 elementary schools and kids from all those schools were in the program but now in one location. Its not a new program, not new students, not even a new building, Williamson said. Point being, taxpayers were going to pay for the students whether or not James got involved. There are 46 schools in the Akron Public School District. Williamson said 35 of those schools have been rebuilt and during that time, the home of the current I Promise school served as the temporary school for those students who were displaced in that in-between time. For about 15 years, this building housed every student from every school that has been rebuilt, Williamson said. Williamson said the 240 students enrolled at I Promise were already in the program but in their respective elementary schools. All were doing is taking kids that we already support and putting them in a different location, he said. The cost of educating the students is consistent. So are the teachers salaries. The opening of this school puts all the students in the I Promise program under one roof from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., July through May. There are no additional costs because the district didnt hire any new teachers or recruit new students. A story on Wannabeent.com says, Lebrons I Promise School To Cost Taxpayers Millions Of Dollars Every Year. The headline and subsequent story might leave people thinking James school will be a drag on taxpayer resources. Buttaxpayers are paying the same amount of money theyd pay whether or not James got involved.Jamess foundation is funding enhancements meant to try to elevate students attending the school. The statement is partially accurate."
15872,half-true,Will Weatherford,"Expanding Medicaid would require borrowing more money, drastically expanding our deficit.","The Florida House did the nation a solid by refusing to expand subsidized health insurance to 1 million low-income Floridians, argues Speaker Will Weatherford. Weatherford was instrumental in blocking a proposal favored by the Florida Senate and Gov. Rick Scott that would have used $51 billion in federal Medicaid dollars over 10 years to provide private health insurance to people below 138 percent of the federal poverty level. In 2013, that is $15,865 for an individual and $32,499 for a family of four. People arguing in favor of Florida expanding Medicaid, one of the biggest facets of President Barack Obamas health care law, argued it is paid for by taxes Floridians already sent to Washington. Weatherford tried to diffuse that, saying he could not support widening the program because more federal spending by an unreliable government will escalate the countrys debt woes. Congress has not passed a budget in four years, and each year the federal government spends over a trillion dollars more than it has, leading to a national debt approaching $17 trillion, he wrote in a May 9 column. Expanding Medicaid would require borrowing more money, drastically expanding our deficit. Does the Medicaid expansion drastically raise the deficit? We wanted to check it out. The deficit is not the same thing as the debt. The deficit is how much the government spends in a year versus what it has on hand to pay what is owes. The debt, at $16.8 trillion and climbing, is the sum of annual deficits. Weatherford spokesman Ryan Duffy responded to our inquiry with a document that includes a Wall Street Journal op-ed by Christina Corieri, a health care policy analyst at the Goldwater Institute, a free-market research group that opposes the expansion of Medicaid. Her column does not say that expanding Medicaid as outlined in the health care law will drastically increase the deficit. Instead Corieri says the Supreme Court ruling presents fiscally conservative states with a the unique opportunity to veto hundreds of billions of dollars in new federal spending. She said that the nearly 30 states that have either opted out or are considering it could save the government $609 billion over the next eight years. The more than $609 billion in total savings from these 30 states would represent over 50 percent of the expected federal spending on the Medicaid expansion, she wrote. A drop in the bucket? That's more than seven times the $85 billion in 2013 sequester cuts and more than half the projected federal deficit for this fiscal year. We sought our own answers, starting with the nonpartisan research arm of Congress, the Congressional Budget Office. CBO has not assessed our specific inquiry about how the Medicaid component of the law influences the deficit, but the office has evaluated the short- and long-term cost of the whole health care law a few times. In short, what CBO determined is the law as a whole reduces the deficit, and repealing the law would increase the deficit. That's because the includes a host of new taxes on high earners and the health care industry. U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis., requested the CBO perform a new analysis for the cost of repealing the health care law, but the CBO director said they essentially did not have time to do it, as there are hundreds of provisions in the ACA and those provisions are already in various stages of implementation, CBO director Douglas Elmendorf wrote May 15. He referred Ryan to a July 2012 analysis completed for Speaker John Boehner for pretty much the same thing. On balance, the CBO and the Joint Committee on Taxation estimated then that repealing the law would result in a net increase in budget deficits of $109 billion over the 2013–2022 period. Although CBO and JCT have not updated that estimate to reflect the most recent baseline projections, we anticipate a similar result were we to do so, Elmendorf wrote. So basically what the government will pay out to subsidize health insurance for the uninsured, such as through tax credits to go on health exchanges or Medicaid, is more than offset by new revenues coming from reduced payments to Medicare providers and insurers as well as new taxes on high-income earners and the health care industry, said Edwin Park, vice president for health policy at the left-leaning Center for Budget and Policy Priorities. While Park considers the CBO estimate of the health care law key to our research, a couple other experts questioned its relevance and pointed out it relies on a lot of assumptions. Corieri, for instance, said CBO has not factored in how removing some unpopular taxes from the law, such as a tax on medical devices, would affect the law's fiscal impact. She also questioned CBO including time before the law takes effect in 2014 into its analysis. Overall, she agrees with Weatherford's point. Obviously if they're not spending that money, then the deficit will be smaller, she said. Marc Goldwein, senior policy director of the Center for a Responsible Federal Budget, said CBOs analysis does not factor in which specific states will expand coverage, so its impossible to know whether Texas and Florida were included in its post-Supreme Court analysis. The researchers assumed 70 percent of beneficiaries would be in states that opted to expand. Any decision in isolation to expand or not expand Medicaid could result in higher or lower overall deficits than if the decision went the other way, he wrote by email. The fact that the bill as a whole reduces the deficit doesnt change that. The best we can say is that expanding Medicaid will require borrowing more money than not expanding Medicaid, he said. The deficit, he added, will be modestly higher if a state elects to expand Medicaid. CBO assumes all laws will be enacted exactly as written, included the component that reduces Medicare cuts to physician payments, which we all know never happens, said Gail Wilensky, a health care analyst who ran the Medicare program under President George H.W. Bush. What is clear is that some of Floridas poorest uninsured people could have had Medicaid coverage at no direct cost to Florida for at least the first three years, she said, adding that Weatherfords logic is hanging on a theoretical and abstract principle. As for Weatherfords statement, Goldwein says its accurate to say expanding Medicaid would require borrowing more money so long as you qualify that means more money than would otherwise be borrowed. Goldwein said its hard to assess the expanding the deficit part of Weatherfords statement. That really raises the question – compared to what? Goldwein said. Steve Ellis, vice president of Taxpayers for Common Sense, took a broader read of Weatherfords claim, saying the health care law is too complicated to tease out the budgetary impacts of any one policy without noting the impacts elsewhere. The speaker talked about it as if expanding Medicaid was the only policy change instead of being coupled with many others in a package that had net deficit reduction and wouldnt require borrowing more money or expanding the deficit, Ellis said. Our ruling Weatherford defended his key role in blocking federal money to help insure more low-income Floridians by pointing to the effect of all that extra health care spending on the countrys national deficit and debt. Expanding Medicaid would require borrowing more money, drastically expanding our deficit, Weatherford said. Theres no doubting the federal Medicaid expansion is a lot of dough, with the government slating about $900 billion over 10 years for each state to expand the program, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. Ramping up federal spending for Medicaid, one of the biggest long-term deficit-drivers, will not be cheap. Weatherfords commentary, however, is vague. He ignores nonpartisan research showing the cost of expanding Medicaid coverage is offset by other parts of the health care law. And yes, states that decide not to expand Medicaid can prevent more federal spending, but it would just further reduce the deficit -- by how much is unknown -- on top of its already slated contraction. Saying Medicaid expansion will drastically enhance the deficit is unproven. Weatherfords claim hits a note about federal spending but omits key information."
12392,half-true,Scott Walker,"Our county now has the fastest growing airport in America, attracting nearly 1,000 new private sector jobs.","On Sept. 14, 2010, after winning the Republican nomination for governor, Milwaukee County Executive Scott Walker in a victory speech rattled off a list of on-the-job accomplishments -- from holding down taxes to cleaning up county government.Among the items Walker listed:Our county now has the fastest growing airport in America, attracting nearly 1,000 new private sector jobs.Every month seems to bring a new announcement from Walkers county office of a new record for passengers at Mitchell International Airport.But is Mitchells traffic growth really leading the nation? And what about those 1,000 jobs?A review of county records shows these are boom times at Mitchell -- thanks to consolidations and convulsions in the airline business. Airlines are adding flights to and from the airport and more passengers are coming through the gates.In July 2010, the airport set a single-month record with 928,497 passengers, the 11th consecutive month of record passenger growth.In the first quarter of 2010, the airport handled 2,192,859 passengers -- a 35.3 percent increase over the first quarter of 2009.That first quarter performance put MKE near the top of an international list.According to Airports Council International, an industry group, Mitchells year-over-year passenger growth was the worlds fourth largest, behind Istanbul, Turkey; Phuket, Thailand; and Moscow. Milwaukee was the only U.S. airport in the top 30 list.So what is going on at Mitchell, and is Walker right to claim county credit for it?Its simple, according to aviation consultant Michael Boyd, of Boyd Group International in Evergreen, Colo.: Three airlines -- AirTran Airways, Southwest and Republic -- are trying to kill each other.It has nothing to do with county government, Boyd said. It has to do with airline economics.After the former owner of Midwest Airlines slashed the number of flights by 40 percent and cut hundreds of jobs, the others moved in on the business.AirTran established a second national hub at Mitchell, increasing departures from 18 to 47 in the past year. Southwest began service in November 2009, adding 10 departures. And Republic, the new owner of Midwest (now operating as Frontier Airlines), began restoring service. It now has 90 flights a day, five less than what Midwest offered a year ago.So the airport is leading the nation in passenger growth -- in part because it is working its way back up of the decline that came when Midwest cut its flights.But what about the nearly 1,000 new private sector jobs?No one counts airport jobs. Not the state, county or the Metropolitan Milwaukee Chamber of Commerce, which compiles area employment reports each month.When asked for documentation, the Walker campaign responded with three clippings -- one each from the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel (Republic Airways to add up to 800 jobs here), BizTimes.com (Southwest Airlines to begin with 12 flights out of Milwaukee) and WISN.com (AirTran Brings More Jobs to Milwaukee). Tallied together, they covered 940 new jobs.The clips were all from 2009, so we contacted the airlines for fresh information.Republic said it has added 500 jobs. AirTran said it added 100. Southwest added 41. Thats about 640 jobs -- far short of those promised of the 940 promised , though AirTran and Republic have said they plan to continue to add jobs into next year.Of course, the new jobs come against the backdrop of lost jobs, as Midwest struggled to stay afloat. The airline cut 2,600 jobs nationwide between early 2008 and the fall of 2009. In Wisconsin, Midwest notified the state of plans to lay off 1,600 workers -- 1,379 in 2008 and 234 in 2009.The other airlines will, no doubt, hire some of those laid-off workers. But employment remains far short of where it was before Midwests fall.So, lets see if Walkers statement flies.When it comes to growth in passenger count, Mitchell International Airport is leading the nation -- though much of that is through regaining traffic that had been lost in recent years. Experts note this is due to an airline battle, more so than any direct action by Walker or the county. On the jobs side, the new (and promised) jobs wont replace all the jobs that were lost. If they ultimately come through, Walkers election-night number of nearly 1,000 may be on target, but for now that portion of his claim can be marked Flight delayed."
8487,half-true,Facebook posts,"Says Nike pays factory workers, 80% of whom are women, 20 cents an hour and has them work 70 to 80 hours a week.","In September 2018, Nike announced an endorsement deal with former NFL quarterback and activist Colin Kaepernick. Since then, claims about the companys labor practices have flooded the internet, attracting thousands of shares on Facebook and Twitter. Many of these viral posts feature a photo of Nike factory workers accompanied by a claim that the company exploits workers with long hours and abysmally low wages. (Most posts are screenshots of a September 2018 tweet by conservative commentator Ryan Fournier.) The posts say: Just so I'm clear: These factory workers (which are 80% female) are making NIKE's for 20 cents an hour and working 70 to 80 hours a week, so NIKE can profit enough to pay Colin Kaepernick millions to speak out against oppression and injustice? The Associated Press photo accompanying the post is legitimate, though quite old. It shows Vietnamese workers putting finishing touches on Nike shoes at a factory in Ho Chi Minh City in February 2005. The posts were flagged as part of Facebooks efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) It is true that, at one time, Nike paid factory workers close to 20 cents per hour and that many worked over 10 hours a day, six days a week. While most of these numbers are now outdated, experts tell us that overseas factory workers for Nike (and most other major garment industry bands) continue to work long hours for low wages. Lets take a look. In October 1996, CBS 48 Hours news program aired an investigative report on the conditions of Nike factories in Vietnam. The segment revealed that factory workers, mostly women, worked six days a week for only $40 a month, which translated to about 20 cents an hour. An investigation by Dara ORourke, a researcher with the Transnational Resource and Action Center, followed in 1997 and reported several labor law violations at the Vietnamese Tae Kwang Vina plant, a factory that employed over 9,000 workers who produced 400,000 pairs of shoes a month for Nike. According to the investigation, the plants night-shift employees worked an average of 10.5 hours a day, six days per week at a monthly salary of $40. A 2003 World Bank report said Nike violated Vietnamese environmental and labor laws by exposing 10,000 workers at the Tae Kwang Vina plant to toxic solvents and forcing them to work above legal overtime limits. The report noted that the investigations, along with public outcry evoked by activists in Vietnam and the United States, prompted Nike to make improvements: Consequently, Nike took proactive measures and allowed independent auditing of the sweatshops. In 1999, Nike implemented its own Code of Conduct in Vietnamese factories. During recent years, there has been a visible improvement in VTs practices, such as safer work conditions and workers awareness of their rights and entitlements. PolitiFact reached out to the Clean Clothes Campaign, an alliance of labor unions that focuses on improving working conditions in the garment and sportswear industries. The organization told us that the numbers for the pay and hours, arent precise but the sentiment with regard to fair pay and treatment is correct: Factory workers for Nike –– and other major sportswear brands such as Adidas and Under Armour –– do not earn anywhere near a living wage. They confirmed that the claim of 80% of factory workers being women lines up with industry estimates, which have been as high as 85%. Clean Clothes also pointed us to a June 2019 report that surveyed top brands about their progress in implementing a living wage for workers and said most brands –– Nike included –– provided no evidence that their workers anywhere in the world were being paid a living wage. Research from 2014 shows that, in most of the Southeast Asian countries that Nike sources from, wages reach around 25% of a living wage. Paul Roeland, a campaign coordinator with the Clean Clothes Campaign, told PolitiFact that, when it comes to working hours, most workers have a contract to work 48 hours a week but regularly continue working beyond that, often up to 60 hours a week. He said the hours fluctuate and are often longer during peak production times. The factual numbers are shocking enough: it would come down to between 65-90 cents (USD) per hour (depending on the country), and regular 60-hour work weeks, Roeland told PolitiFact by email. That said, he bristled at the overall message in this viral post: At Clean Clothes Campaign, our aim is in supporting garment workers worldwide, as it has been over the past 30 years, Roeland said. However, we strongly believe that criticizing Nike's labour practices with the sole aim of disparaging the anti-racist activism of others, as some right-wing U.S. political figures are doing, is highly disingenuous. Garment workers deserve so much better than to be used as a handy argument in a social media meme. PolitiFact reached out to Nike for a response but did not hear back in time for publication. Nikes code of conduct for supplier facilities reads, the regular work week shall not exceed 48 hours and suppliers should allow workers at least 24 consecutive hours of rest in every seven-day period. All overtime work shall be consensual. Suppliers shall not request overtime on a regular basis and shall compensate all overtime work at a premium rate. Other than in extraordinary circumstances, the sum of regular and overtime hours in a week shall not exceed 60 hours. Its important to note that Nike isnt alone. While wages and hours for factory workers vary from country to country, many major companies use the same factories and all pay the same low wages for their workers. Experts tell us that while it depends on the country and the volume of production, violation of legal overtime standards is common in the garment industry. Viral social media posts claim that Nikes factory employees work 70 to 80 hours a week and get paid 20 cents an hour. The numbers in the post are outdated, but not entirely far off. Today, Nike pays workers more than 20 cents an hour and employees work, on average, a little less than 70 to 80 hours per week. However, workers rights experts tell us the pay from Nike and other major brands is still below a living wage and average weekly hours are routinely well above standard workweeks."
4761,half-true,Martina Navratilova,"In 29 states in this country you can still get fired for not just being gay, but if your employer thinks you are gay.","One of the biggest news stories of last week came from the world of sports, with NBA player Jason Collins becoming the first active male athlete playing for a major U.S. team sport to come out as gay. Several Sunday public-affairs shows tried to put Collins declaration into historical context. CBS Face the Nation invited retired tennis great Martina Navratilova, among others, to discuss its significance. Navratilova came out as gay more than three decades ago. I think when President (Barack) Obama came in favor of  gay marriage, that really changed the tide. But we have to remember that this has been a long time coming, she said. We still don't have equal rights. I have been getting (questions) on Twitter, Why does this matter? I don't care. Which is kind of code for, I really don't want to know. But it does matter because in 29 states in this country you can still get fired for not just being gay but if your employer thinks you are gay. ... We don't have equal rights. We wondered whether Navratilova was correct that in 29 states in this country you can still get fired for not just being gay, but if your employer thinks you are gay. According to the Human Rights Campaign, a gay-rights group, 21 states plus the District of Columbia explicitly prohibit employment discrimination based on sexual orientation. The remaining 29 do not. (This map shows the legal situation by state.) We should note that the 29 states in question are defined by the absence of a law prohibiting discrimination based on sexual orientation, rather than the presence of a law allowing such discrimination. This means employees in these states who believe they are discriminated against would not have grounds to win a lawsuit alleging discrimination. The group said that its possible for an employer to discriminate based on the perception, rather than the fact, that someone is gay. But while Navratilova gets the number right, our discussions with legal experts produced a few exceptions to the rule: • Government employees in those states have protections. Government workers are covered by the equal protection clause of the 14th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. A public employee can establish a violation if they can show they were subjected to adverse treatment when compared with other similarly situated employees, and that the treatment was motivated by an intention to discriminate on the basis of improper considerations, according to Lambda Legal Defense, a legal organization focused on challenging discrimination against lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender individuals. Courts have backed the idea that sexual orientation is one of the categories that would permit such a lawsuit. In addition, nine other states -- beyond the 21 that currently ban discrimination based on sexual orientation -- have an executive order, administrative order or personnel regulation that prohibits such discrimination against public employees, according to the Human Rights Campaign. • Localities may have an anti-discrimination law even if their state does not. To give just one example, Pennsylvania has no statewide law, but many of its cities do, from Philadelphia and Pittsburgh all the way down to Jenkintown and Susquehanna Township, according to the Pennsylvania Diversity Network. According to the group, 12 of the 15 most populous cities in the Keystone State have anti-discrimination laws that cover sexual orientation, meaning a sizable percentage of employees in the state are covered even without a state law. • Individual employers may have policies that bar discrimination based on sexual orientation, even if their state or city does not. Some employers, through union agreements, company handbooks or other contracts, may have explicitly or implicitly promised to refrain from certain kinds of discrimination, and these provisions, depending on the particulars, might protect some employees against irrational discrimination of this kind, said Vik Amar, a law professor at the University of California at Davis. • Title VII of the Civil Rights Act provides protection for employees who are subjected to gender-based stereotyping. This is relevant because Navratilova said you could get fired if your employer thinks you are gay -- not just if you are actually gay. While the Civil Rights Act currently protects only sex discrimination and not discrimination based on sexual orientation, gender-based stereotyping can include elements that overlap significantly with an employer think(ing) you are gay. Hayley Gorenberg, deputy legal director of Lambda Legal, cited the 1989 Supreme Court case Price Waterhouse vs. Hopkins. In that case, a woman sued the accounting firm where she worked because she was not offered a promotion after a senior manager told her she should walk more femininely, talk more femininely, dress more femininely, wear make-up, have her hair styled, and wear jewelry. The plaintiff convinced the court that sex stereotyping constitutes sex discrimination, Gorenberg said. This precedent could protect a straight person who appeared to an employer to be gay and suffered discrimination as a result. Gorenberg said that despite these exceptions, Navratilova has a point. She said that calls to her groups national legal help line include a very high percentage of workplace discrimination complaints. Without specific national protection, people are fired based on their sexual orientation far more easily, she said. Our ruling Navratilova said, In 29 states in this country you can still get fired for not just being gay, but if your employer thinks you are gay. If you frame this statement in the context of blanket protections by states, shes correct. Still, even in those 29 states, many gay and lesbian employees do have protections, either because they work for the government, because they live in a city that bars such discrimination, or because they work for a company that has pledged not to discriminate based on sexual orientation."
8317,half-true,Charlie Crist,"41,200 veterans in Florida dont have health care because Scott didnt expand Medicaid.","As Memorial Day approached, both Gov. Rick Scott and his anticipated Democratic rival Charlie Crist called on Veterans Administration Secretary Eric Shinseki to resign amid news reports that VA staff falsified documentation about how long veterans were waiting to receive health care. But then Crist pointed the finger at Scott in a series of tweets on May 22 and 23: • In addition -- if I were governor, I would take immediate action to make sure our veterans here in FL are getting the care they need. • Id call a special session to expand health care to the more than 41,000 FL vets who are left w/o coverage due to Scotts failure. • 41.2k vets in FL dont have health care because Scott didn't expand Medicaid. Unconscionable. It was that last tweet that caught our eye. We decided to fact-check the number Crist cited and whether they lack health care because Scott failed to expand Medicaid. Florida rejects Medicaid expansion Medicaid is an insurance program operated by states in partnership with the federal government to care for low-income people. The Affordable Care Act aimed to expand the program. Specifically, the law would cover all costs for the first three years for states to extend Medicaid to households earning up to 138 percent of the federal poverty level — which in 2013 was $15,865 for an individual, $32,499 for a family of four. Scott, who campaigned on his opposition to Obamacare, initially opposed Medicaid expansion. But in February 2013 he changed his position and came out in support of it. Scott didnt push the Republican-led Legislature to approve it, and ultimately legislators rejected it. The result is that now more than 800,000 uninsured Floridians earn too much to qualify for Medicaid but too little to qualify for subsidies to help buy insurance in the federal marketplace. Urban Institute study  About 40 percent of veterans nationwide are on VA care. Generally, veterans have to serve for two consecutive years and not be discharged dishonorably to be eligible for VA health care, which gives priority to those with service-related injuries or who are low income. Also, some veterans choose not to enroll in VA care, for example, if they dont live near any VA facilities. Some veterans who either arent eligible or choose not to enroll in VA could be eligible for Medicaid. In tweeting his attack, Crist linked to a March 2013 nationwide study by the Washington-based Urban Institute. The study analyzed U.S. Census Bureau data to estimate how many military veterans aged 19 to 64 dont have insurance. (Veterans 65 and older qualify, like other Americans, for Medicare.) The study found that 535,000 uninsured veterans nationwide would qualify for Medicaid or new subsidies under the Affordable Care Act. However, the majority would only qualify for Medicaid if their state chose to expand it. The institutes report said in Florida there were 103,700 non-elderly veterans who lacked health insurance, which included 41,200 who would qualify for Medicaid if the state expanded the program. We ran the study by Jack Tsai, an assistant professor of psychiatry at Yale who co-wrote a separate study about the number of uninsured veterans and Medicaid expansion, but didnt include a state-by-state breakdown. Tsai said that the methodology of the Urban Institute study is fairly solid. However, he noted it is based on data from a few years ago, and that Crists statement didnt include details about the studys limitations. There are various reasons why some veterans remain uninsured: Some might feel they dont need insurance or havent gotten around to obtaining it or may not be aware of their VA eligibility or dont want anything to go to the VA. Likewise, there might be similar reasons to not enroll with Medicaid, while others could be in between jobs. We asked spokespersons for the governors office and his campaign if they had any evidence to refute Crists claim. Campaign spokesman Greg Blair reiterated that Scott supported Medicaid but the Legislature didnt go along with it. He also pointed to 2011 Medicaid reform intended to lower the cost of health care. Our ruling Crist said in a tweet that 41,200 veterans in Florida dont have health care because Scott didnt expand Medicaid. Crists tweet linked to a map that cited the Urban Institute study showing the number of uninsured veterans in each state that might qualify for the Medicaid expansion. Crists tweet omits two major points: Some of those 41,200 veterans could get health care other ways. Its possible some are eligible for services through the VA but for a variety of reasons havent sought those benefits. Also, Scotts not solely responsible for Florida failing to expand Medicaid. After Scott opposed the expansion, he came out in support of it in February 2013. But Scott didnt lobby for it, and the Legislature rejected it last year."
9513,half-true,Tom Cotton,Says Mark Pryorcut Medicare to pay for Obamacare.,"So far, PolitiFact has heard some familiar attacks in the 2014 midterm election campaign rhetoric. The latest comes from the Arkansas Senate race, where incumbent Mark Pryor, a Democrat, faces U.S. Rep. Tom Cotton, a Republican. Recently, they traded jabs over Medicare funding. Some politicians like Tom Cotton voted to cut Social Security, turn Medicare into a voucher system and raise the age of eligibility to 70, Pryors ad said. Pryor cut Medicare to pay for Obamacare, Cottons ad shot back. Weve addressed Pryors claim in a separate fact-check. Here, well focus on Cottons assertion that the Affordable Care Act strips Medicare funding. Cottons office didnt respond to our requests for comment, but we did hear from Pryors folks. Were certainly no stranger to different versions of this claim. There is a connection between the Affordable Care Act and cuts to Medicare funding. Both parties have recognized a need to rein in Medicare costs, which were growing at an annual rate of 6.8 percent in 2010, according to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. Without reform, the nations already excessive health care spending would have reached unsustainable levels within the next few decades, the 2010 CMS report read. With the enactment of the health care law, Medicares growth was projected to slow to 5.3 percent, according to the same CMS report. Over time, CMS predicts this will result in a 10-year savings of more than $700 billion. The savings will come from reductions to Medicare Advantage, which represents a subset of Medicare plans run by private insurers. In additions, hospitals will be paid less if they dont meet certain benchmarks for patient care. The laws intent was to save money by making the system more efficient and without making reductions in benefits. So Obamacare doesnt cut Medicare funding that already exists. Rather, it controls future spending, which politicians on both sides of the aisle called for.  The cost control is part of what Congress does to try to manage the insanely complex and expensive Medicare system, said Jay Wolfson, a public health professor at the University of South Florida. It is not new, nor is it partisan. When Mark Pryor voted with the Senate to pass Obamacare in 2009, he wasnt voting to cut Medicare. He was voting to slow its growth. The goal is to reallocate some of the money saved toward Obamacares goal of covering the currently uninsured, said Timothy Jost, a Washington and Lee University health policy law professor. So the savings are designed to offset costs in Obamacare so that the law doesnt increase the national deficit. Our ruling Cottons ad claimed that Pryor cut Medicare to pay for Obamacare. In reality, the Affordable Care Act calls for a slowed growth of Medicare funding, not a slash to current funds. The savings from this approach will be used to offset Obamacare costs."
14821,half-true,Hillary Clinton,"The Bush administration has the Pentagon trying to take away the signing bonuses when a soldier gets wounded and ends up in the hospital, something that I'm working with a Republican senator to try to make sure never can happen again.","The dig by Sen. Hillary Clinton makes the Bush administration's treatment of wounded veterans seem almost so heartless as to be implausible. The Bush administration sends mixed messages, Clinton said during the Democratic debate in Las Vegas. They want to recruit and retain these young people to serve our country and then they have the Pentagon trying to take away the signing bonuses when a soldier gets wounded and ends up in the hospital, something that I'm working with a Republican senator to try to make sure never can happen again. The Army suggests this issue may all be a tempest in a political teapot, that it simply made a clerical error in asking a wounded vet to return a portion of his signing bonus. But there's another issue, one that may be a bit more legitimate: whether wounded soldiers ought to be guaranteed future installments of enlistment bonuses, bonuses pegged to future years of service they were not able to complete. In 2007, nearly 39,000 army recruits received an average of $16,500 in enlistment bonuses, according to Maj. Nathan M. Banks Sr. of the Department of the Army Public Affairs. The issue Clinton addresses was first raised in July 2007 by the bipartisan Dole-Shalala Commission, when, in the course of work with veterans and their families, they noticed that service members' remaining enlistment bonuses were not being paid when they were injured and medically retired or separated from active duty. The Defense Department assured the problem was fixed. In October 2007, Rep. Jason Altmire, D-Pa., introduced the Veterans Guaranteed Bonus Act to formally ensure that wounded veterans are paid the entirety of any signing bonus they were promised within 30 days after discharge for combat-related wounds. A Senate version of the bill was introduced by Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Ala., in November 2007. The Senate bill has 18 co-sponsors, including Clinton. The issue gathered steam that month when a Pittsburgh television station reported the story of Jordan Fox, an army private who was partially blinded in one eye from the explosion of a roadside bomb in Iraq. After Fox returned home with a medical discharge, he got a letter from the Army asking him to repay $2,800 of a $7,500 enlistment bonus. While Fox was held up by many politicians as Exhibit A in the case for the new legislation, his case also may have muddied the waters. The Army says it simply made an error in pay processing. Defense Department policy is clear: Bonuses already paid should not be recouped if injury or illness of the service member was not the result of the service member's misconduct. The Army contends Fox's was an isolated case. In fact, when it set up a hotline for pay problems, it received just two calls on that issue. So are we talking about legislation to fix a problem that may have affected just three people? As it relates to wounded soldiers having to return portions of paid bonuses, perhaps. And certainly a lot of politicians made a lot of political hay about that. But that's different than unpaid, future installments of bonuses. Say a soldier who got a $10,000 up-front bonus, and was promised an additional $5,000 at the end of each of three years of completed duty. If he was injured and medically discharged in his first year of service, would he get the final two years of unpaid bonuses? Defense Department policy there is less clear. The secretary of the Military Department may decide to pay the soldier unpaid installments if he or she determines that not paying would be against equity and good conscience, or contrary to the best interests of the United States. The legislation Clinton co-sponsored would require the military to pay all future installments upon medical discharge. No one knows, still, how many wounded veterans this may affect. The Congressional Budget Office informally told congressional staffs that the proposed legislation — to include unpaid installments — might cost about $1-million a year. That may seem like a lot of money, but considering the number of wounded vets, it doesn't suggest they think this is a widespread, institutional problem. The Senate bill seeks an accounting by the military to find out. So while Clinton highlights a legitimate issue — paying future installments of enlistment bonuses even after wounded veterans have been discharged — her wording is somewhat misleading, suggesting wounded veterans are being forced to return bonus money. There is little evidence to suggest that happened to more than a couple veterans, and the Army admitted its mistake. Also misleading is her suggestion that there was some kind of Bush administration effort to deny future bonus payments promised to wounded vets. But she may be right that some were denied future bonus payments (although it is far from clear that this is still happening), and the legislation co-sponsored by Clinton would make it crystal clear they are to be paid.

16309,half-true,Mike Gibbons,Joe Biden's sanctions on Russia are riddled with loopholes and don't even start for 30 days. They have carve outs for the energy and financial sectors.,"In ads for their 2022 campaigns, some Republicans are attacking President Joe Bidens sanctions on Russia as too slow and too weak. One ad is in the race for an open Senate seat in Ohio, which could help determine which party controls the Senate. Biden's sanctions are riddled with loopholes and don't even start for 30 days, investment banker Mike Gibbons said in his ad on Facebook and Instagram. They have carve outs for the energy and financial sectors. The claim is a mixed bag: Some of the sanctions took immediate effect, some were phased in over 30 days. The energy sector was largely spared, but banks were targeted directly. Russia invaded Ukraine Feb. 24, but the United States began imposing sanctions two days earlier, in response to Russias deployment of troops into two pro-Russian regions of eastern Ukraine. The Feb. 22 sanctions focused on two major Russian state-owned financial institutions, imposed restrictions on Russian sovereign debt and sanctioned five Kremlin-connected elites, according to the U.S. Treasury Department. The Feb. 24 sanctions, according to a Treasury Department news release, targeted all of Russias largest financial institutions and the ability of state-owned and private entities to raise capital — and further bars Russia from the global financial system. Gibbons ad cited that news release. In all, between Feb. 22 and March 3, the U.S. imposed 148 sanctions on Russia, according to a running list produced by CORRECTIV, a nonprofit investigative newsroom in Germany. In announcing the Feb. 24 sanctions, Biden said some effects were immediate, but he also alluded to 30 days in terms of assessing their effects. Weve cut off Russias largest bank — a bank that holds more than one-third of Russias banking assets by itself — cut it off from the U.S. financial system, Biden said. He added: The sanctions we imposed exceed anything thats ever been done. The sanctions we imposed have generated two-thirds of the world joining us. They are profound sanctions. Lets have a conversation in another month or so to see if theyre working. Navin Bapat, a professor of peace and war in political science at the University of North Carolina, said the Feb. 24 sanctions provided for a period of 30 days to allow U.S. financial institutions to wind down their transactions. But the Feb. 22 sanctions took effect more quickly. They prohibited U.S. institutions from participating in purchasing rubles or any other assets from Russian financial institutions after March 1, Bapat said. Gibbons campaign cited clauses in the sanctions that allow exceptions for certain financial transactions, including some related to the energy industry. The Biden administration, facing the possibility that energy sanctions could lead to higher gas prices in the United States and energy prices abroad, has acknowledged that the energy sector was not a major target. Daleep Singh, a deputy national security advisor and deputy director of the National Economic Council, said at a news conference on the Feb. 24 sanctions: To be clear: Our sanctions are not designed to cause any disruption to the current flow of energy from Russia to the world. Weve carved out energy payments on a time-bound basis to allow for an orderly transition of these flows away from sanctioned institutions, and weve provided other licenses to provide for an orderly winddown of business. Republican and Democratic lawmakers have moved to stop the U.S. from importing oil from Russia. Alan Cole, a former economist with Congress Joint Economic Committee and former adviser to U.S. Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, wrote in an article cited by Gibbons campaign that while the sanctions are an impressive effort overall, the sanctions also have a glaring weakness: They largely spare Russias all-important energy sector, the backbone of its entire economy, and its agricultural center — the country is a major wheat exporter. Russia expert Harley Balzer, an emeritus professor of government and international affairs at Georgetown University, told PolitiFact that Biden is endeavoring to balance punishing Russia and preventing serious damage in Europe from rising energy prices and threatened supplies. The financial sanctions are causing havoc on the Russian stock market, causing the market cap of major Russian firms to drop more than 90% on foreign exchanges and clobbering the ruble, he added. Freezing the Russian Central Bank assets abroad reduced their reserves from $600 billion to $300 billion. They are spending $5 billion to $10 billion per day to keep the ruble from depreciating even more. Cronies' assets are being confiscated at an increasing pace. All of that has far more immediate impact than the oil and gas sanctions. Other Republicans have run ads similar to Gibbons. Rep. Ted Budd, who is running for the U.S. Senate in North Carolina, and Georgia U.S. House candidate Alan Sims both said the sanctions were too little, too late; Jeffrey Sossa-Paquette, who is running for a U.S. House in Massachusetts, said the sanctions leave out gas and oil. The Ohio Senate seat Gibbons wants is open because the incumbent, Republican Rob Portman, is not seeking reelection. Both the GOP and the Democratic Senate primaries, to be held May 3, are contested. Besides Gibbons, the Republican candidates include Ohio state Sen. Matt Dolan; former Ohio state treasurer Josh Mandel; former Ohio Republican Party chair Jane Timken; and Hillbilly Elegy author J.D. Vance. The leading Democratic candidate is U.S. Rep. Tim Ryan. Overall, the Ohio race is rated variously by campaign watchers as lean Republican, as likely Republican and solid Republican. Gibbons said Biden's sanctions on Russia are riddled with loopholes and don't even start for 30 days. They have carve outs for the energy and financial sectors. Some of the sanctions made a quick impact and some were phased in over 30 days. The energy sector was largely spared, but banks were targeted directly."
13627,half-true,Julius Jones,"The policy mistakes that ... the Clintons made got us, in large degree, to the situation that we are in today with mass incarceration.","Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton offered a glimpse of her approach to issues affecting African-Americans in a tense exchange with Black Lives Matter activists that was recorded and spread across social media. Clinton told Boston-area organizers Julius Jones and Daunasia Yancey that she didnt believe in changing hearts on issues of racial justice but in changing laws and reallocating resources instead. Jones and Yancey expressed concern about Clintons remarks on MSNBCs The Rachel Maddow Show the next week. She doesnt actually feel like you can move this issue forward other than through policy, Jones said, even though the policy mistakes that she and the Clintons made got us, in large degree, to the situation that we are in today with mass incarceration. We wanted to see if Jones was right to blame the Clintons for the United States prison woes. We reached out to Jones, who identifies himself as the founder of Black Lives Matter Worcester, and Black Lives Matter Boston to clarify what Jones meant, but we did not hear back from either source. The underlying policy, however, is well-known. The question is how much it contributed to the growth of Americas prison population.As we'll see, the growth of the prison population started well before the federal law. A tough-on-crime environment As Jones suggests, the United States has the highest incarceration rate among developed nations, at around 700 prisoners per 100,000 people. African-Americans in particular are locked up at disproportionate rates. According to the Bureau of Justice Statistics, 37 percent of the 1.5 million men in state and federal prisons in 2013 were black, more than twice the percentage of their share of the population. It wasnt always this high; before 1975, the incarceration rate hovered around 200 prisoners. Some of the growth had to do with Clinton policies, but experts said not all. Crime policy during the 1970s and 1980s was driven by the War on Drugs, an initiative launched by President Richard Nixon in 1971. Nixon famously called drug abuse public enemy No. 1, which led to tougher sentencing and more arrests. New York passed the nations first mandatory minimums for drug offenses in 1973, and Washington passed the first state-level truth-in-sentencing law in 1984. By 1987, five states had adopted sentencing guidelines for judges to follow. President Bill Clinton took office in January1993 touting a tough-on-crimeagenda in response to an increase in violent crime and swelling homicide numbers. High-profile killings, such asthe murder of Polly Klaas, followed later that year. Bill Clinton was instrumental in the passage of the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994. Authored by then-Sen. Joe Biden, the sweeping crime bill provided $10 billion to fund new prisons, $6.1 billion for crime prevention and money for 100,000 new police officers. It also enforced harsher sentencing in federal prisons and incentivized the creation of truth-in-sentencing laws at the state level. These laws require violent offenders to serve a minimum portion of their original sentence by ruling out the possibility of early parole. Under the bill, states that set this minimum at 85 percent of the sentence were granted funding for new prisons, and by 1998, 27 states and the District of Columbia had qualified. The president took the final minutes of his first State of the Union to lobby for the bill. Hillary Clinton, too, campaigned for the legislation in speeches and interviews across the country. The bill ultimately found wide support among Democrats and a handful of Republicans. Just five years after the crime bill was passed, 29 states had truth-in-sentencing laws, and 24 had three strikes laws. The bills effect So did the crime bill lead to mass incarceration? The Prison Policy Initiative, a nonprofit group that supports reducing the prison population, has tracked the massive expansion of people in federal, local and state prisons over the past century.  Yes, the overall inmate population of the United States has grown significantly since 1994. But the sharp upward trend actually started in the early 1980s. Prisons were adding inmates in 1990 at about the same rate they were in 1997, three years after the crime bill became law. In addition, the bills new sentencing standards only directly applied to federal cases. But most of the growth since 1980 has taken place within state systems, which have added almost 1.25 million prisoners over that time. So even though the number of people in federal prison has grown, perhaps as a result of those new standards, federal prisoners represent only a small fraction of the national prison populations overall growth. And while the bill incentivized truth-in-sentencing laws at the state level, many states had already enacted harsher laws on their own by 1994, said Marc Mauer, the executive director of the Sentencing Project, a prison policy think tank. Mauer said its hard to place the onus of responsibility solely on the Clinton-backed crime bill because the trend towards mass incarceration started as early as 1980. (The bill) is sometimes unfairly viewed as being the major factor that has contributed to high incarceration rates, he said. So what really drove up the inmate population? Criminal justice policy leading up to the crime bill was driven by the War on Drugs and the desire to appear tough on crime by focusing on punishment and retribution, not rehabilitation, said Nicholas Turner, president of the Vera Institute of Justice, an advocacy and research group that published a retrospective on the bill in 2014. Still, the 1994 bill was the single biggest legislative victory for the tough-on-crime movement. It certainly didnt help the mass incarceration epidemic, Turner said. Crime rates have been on the decline since the early 1990s, making todays high incarceration levels even more apparent. In the past few years, the Clintons have backtracked on the policies they once championed. The former president seems to regret the bills passage. I signed a bill that made the problem worse, he recently told the NAACP. And I want to admit that. Hillary Clinton has also called for changes to the justice system during her presidential campaign, saying in an April 2015 speechthat we don't want to create another 'incarceration generation.'  Clinton's campaign highlightedits transcript of her exchange withBlack Lives Matter activists where she concedes that what was tried and howit was implemented has not produced the kinds of outcomes that any ofus would want.  Our ruling Jones said, The policy mistakes that (Hillary) and the Clintons made got us, in large degree, to the situation that we are in today with mass incarceration. While Hillary Clinton as first lady had no official role in voting for or signing the 1994 crime bill, she certainly championed some of its policies that are now partially blamed for the growth of the prison population, such as longer, tougher prison sentences. The crime bill was not the root cause of this growth, however, as Americas prison population had been expanding since the late 1980s."
17206,half-true,National Federation of Independent Business-Virginia,The vast majority of minimum wage workers get a raise within a year.,"Minimum-wage jobs may not be the dead-end theyre portrayed to be, according to the National Federation of Independent Business. The vast majority of minimum wage workers get a raise within a year, says an infographic posted on the website of the Virginia chapter of the small business lobby. We emailed Nicole Riley, state director for the federation in Virginia, to see what that claim was based on. We heard back from Todd Pack, a federation spokesman for the group. Pack pointed us to a 2004 report by the Employment Policies Institute, a fiscally conservative think tank. That study crunched U.S. Census Bureau data looking at the earnings of workers from 1979 to 2002. It examined how a minimum-wage workers pay in one year compared to the following year. Its conclusion: Over the 23 years of data studied in the report, nearly two-thirds of minimum-wage employees who continue employment are earning more than the minimum wage within 1–12 months, the report says. Well note that passage includes the qualifier that it focuses on minimum wage workers who continue working. Some low-wage workers may leave the workforce or become unemployed before they get a pay bump. Still, the reports conclusion says minimum-wage employees get a pay bump based on their hard work and hence Nearly two-thirds receive a raise within a year of starting employment. One issue with the Employment Policies Institute report is its age. It looks at a time period that ended in 2002. Thats 14 years ago and five years before the Great Recession started to grip the U.S. A more recent study examined this question. Researchers at Texas A&M University revisited the issue as part of a broad look at the minimum wage and its effect on employment in a 2013 paper. They studied Census Bureau data from 1979 through 2012 in which minimum-wage workers were asked about their earnings in an initial survey and again in a second interview a year later. The researchers found that among all minimum-wage workers, 16.55 percent of them left the labor force within a year and didnt try to find a new jobs, and another 5.85 percent became unemployed but sought new work. Among those who remained employed, 65.85 percent were paid more than the minimum wage in the following year. The median higher pay for those workers was an additional $1 an hour, according to the report. When looking at all minimum-wage workers, including those who lost a job or left the labor force altogether, about 51 percent of them were earning higher than the minimum wage after a year on the job. Jonathan Meer, a co-author of the Texas A&M report and an economics professor there, told us workers who got a pay hike may have been at the same job or moved on to another employer. We should note that the minimum wage included people who live in states that defer to the $7.25-an-hour federal minimum wage as well as in states that set the minimum at a higher rate. There are 29 states that have a higher minimum wage than the federal rate, but Virginia is not one of them, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Jeremy West, the other co-author of the Texas A&M report, updated the figures for us. He said 72 percent of all minimum wage workers got a raise between 2014 and 2015. But about one-fifth of them got raises only because the minimum wage had been increased in their states. That means 57.5 percent of minimum wage earners got a raise at the discretion of their employers or because they found higher-paying jobs between 2014 and 2015. A final note: Our colleagues at PunditFact back in 2014 examined a similar statement by Steve Forbes, the former GOP presidential candidate. Tara Sinclair, an economist at George Washington University, told them that people who keep their minimum-wage jobs for one year are proving theyre dedicated employees who can hold jobs and that might speak more to why theyre getting a raise than anything else. As for those minimum-wage workers who instead leave the labor force entirely, they might be choosing to do so because they figure they can do about as well without a paycheck, Sinclair told PunditFact. Our ruling The National Federation of Independent Business here in Virginia says on its website that the vast majority of minimum wage workers get a raise within a year. The group finds support from an older report from 12 years ago that says two-thirds of workers who stayed on the job got a raise within a year. The most recent numbers show that 72 percent of minimum wage workers got a raise between 2014 and 2015. But one-fifth of them got the boost only because their state had raised its minimum wage - a step the NFIB opposes. That means 57.5 percent of the workers got a raise at the discretion of their employers or because they had found better-paying jobs. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/2d50a0a2-974e-4229-bf51-191c8b60d9b2"
16084,half-true,Elizabeth Colbert Busch,"In South Carolina, women earn 76 cents on the dollar to mens earnings.","Next month, South Carolina voters head to the polls for a special election to select a new representative for the U.S. House in the states 1st Congressional District. The race between former Gov. Mark Sanford, a Republican candidate known for his infamous antics, and Elizabeth Colbert Busch, a Democratic candidate known for her talk-show host brothers antics, has garnered national attention for Georgias next-door neighbor.  This week, Colbert Busch tried to capitalize on Sanfords poor reputation with women, while pushing for equity in employee pay.  The Colbert Busch campaign did not return a call and an email for comment.  In South Carolina, women earn 76 cents on the dollar to mens earnings, the candidate said in a news release. She went on to say that I am committed to making sure that women earn the same pay for the same work.  PolitiFact has heard and examined similar wage gap claims before. We decided to revisit the claim and check any new material available on the subject to see whether Colbert Buschs claim was correct.  Colbert Busch made her comments about the wage gap on Equal Pay Day. That day symbolizes how many months after one year a woman must work, on average, to earn as much as a man earned that same one year.  In conjunction with Equal Pay Day, the National Partnership for Women and Families released a report examining the pay gap in the states and 50 largest metropolitan areas. For South Carolina, the group found that women in general are paid 76 cents for every dollar paid to men. The report is based on census data of full-time, year-round workers. The NPWF used the study to push for passage of the Paycheck Fairness Act to prevent pay discrimination.  Colbert Buschs figure is correct, and based on numerous studies that have controlled for factors like education level and time on the job and they still cannot explain the gender wage gap, said Drucilla Barker, a professor of womens and gender studies at the University of South Carolina. Women and men do different kinds of work and in general womens work pays less than mens work, she said. The question then becomes why?  Last year, a National Womens Law Center report provided a state-by-state ranking comparing median earnings for both genders for full-time, year-round workers, regardless of occupation, based on census data. The report found that in 2011 in South Carolina, women earned 75.6 cents for every dollar earned by a man.  The state gaps follow the often-repeated national data that shows women earning 77 cents to every dollar a man earns.The 77-cent figure is derived from a 2010 census report comparing female-to-male earnings ratio of full-time, year-round workers.  But that report compares all workers, regardless of occupation and other factors such as education level and time on the job. It has been used widely to support eliminating gender discrimination.  Last June, in a campaign ad, President Barack Obama claimed that women are paid 77 cents on the dollar for doing the same work as men. Obama neglected to include employee factors such as education level, occupation and time on the job in his analysis, and received a Mostly False rating for oversimplifying his statement. A few months later, Colorado legislator Diana DeGette received a Mostly True rating for her claim that women receive only 77 cents for every dollar a man earns because she did not use the same work as men qualifier.  The 23-cent gap has been challenged by economists and policy groups who say the gap is much smaller when factors such as education, type of job and experience level are considered.  This week, the Independent Womens Forum, a conservative nonprofit group, posted a video about the gap, calling it inaccurate, and saying that proposed laws to close the perceived gap will lead to undue government regulation.  In October, a study by the American Association of University Women, which advocates for equity for women and girls, analyzed mens and womens earnings one year after graduation. Study authors maintain that a wage gap for almost all occupations still exists. When taking qualifiers such as education, training, age and parental status into account, women in 2009 still earned 6.6 percent less than men, the study concluded.  This unexplained gap could be attributed to gender discrimination and womens ability to negotiate salaries, the report found. An AAUW researcher noted that the wage gap can grow as careers progress.  How much of a pay gap between women and men is due to discrimination against women is unclear, said Gary Burtless, an economist with the Brookings Institution. But a fair-minded person should certainly take account of hours worked per week before calculating the earnings penalty of being a women. It is less clear how much of the occupational difference, the job tenure difference and the work experience difference between women and men we should take into account.  Our conclusion:  Colbert Busch said that in South Carolina, women earn 76 cents on the dollar to mens earnings.  PolitiFact has examined similar wage gap claims several times over the past couple of years. During that time, the data used to make the claims has been reviewed extensively. Each time, we have noted that some studies reporting the larger gaps do not take into account several variables impacting pay, including types of occupations, age of employee, education and training, hours worked and duration on the job.  That is the case with the claim made by Colbert Busch.  Making such a blanket statement without the context of the qualifiers is disingenuous.  There is a wage gap between men and women. She is right about that.  But most studies indicate it tends to diminish when other factors are considered. Colbert Buschs claim is accurate, but it leaves out substantial context that would give the reader a different impression."
13535,half-true,Rick Perry,"Since 2000, Texas has reduced harmful pollutants in the air like nitrogen oxide by 62.5 percent, and ozone by 23 percent--a reduction that is 12 percent greater than the national average.","Gov. Rick Perry visited a familiar boast about the clearing skies of Texas in a May 19, 2014, letter to President Barack Obama that may have tested possible themes of another gubernatorial run for president. Saying Texas employs an all-of-the-above energy strategy tapping fossil fuels plus solar, biofuel and wind resources, Perry wrote: Even as our population has grown by more than 5 million since 2000, we've led the U.S. energy revolution while protecting our environment and reducing harmful pollutants in the air like nitrogen oxide by 62.5 percent, and ozone by 23 percent — a reduction that is 12 percent greater than the national average. 62, 23, 12 — sounds like a quarterbacks call before the snap. We were curious about his numbers. Is Perry right about the pollution reductions as well as the cuts outpacing decreases nationally? A 2010 fact check Perry made a similar claim in June 2010, saying in a press release the Texas clean air program (has) achieved a 22 percent reduction in ozone and a 46 percent decrease in NOx (nitrogen oxide) emissions. Hed earlier cited the same statistic in a letter to Obama. Half True, we found then. Perry accurately recapped improvements in ozone levels. But as for the NOx emissions contributing to ozone levels, his statistic included only one NOx source — industrial — which he did not note. Notably, nearly three-quarters of NOx emissions come from other sources. Also, whether state government merited credit for the improvements struck us as worthy of pause. Even if the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality was responsible for the drop in industrial NOx emissions, federal efforts — in particular, vehicle emission regulations — were a key factor. Significantly, too, the state's ozone-related programs existed to help Texas comply with federal expectations. As noted then, a goal of the federal Clean Air Act is to reduce the levels of what the Environmental Protection Agency calls commonly found air pollutants. Among those is ground-level ozone, which forms when nitrogen oxide emissions mix with volatile organic compounds in sunlight and heat. Common sources of nitrogen oxides: cars and trucks, power plants and industrial boilers. EPA sets limits on the concentration of ozone, the primary component of smog, in the air. Areas that fail to meet the standard are designated in nonattainment. Under the Clean Air Act, the state is required to submit plans to EPA that outline how it will clean up areas and meet the federal standard. Figures hold up As in 2010, we asked David T. Allen, a University of Texas professor of chemical engineering, about Perrys statement. By email, Allen noted that per figures posted online by the TCEQ, Perrys analysis holds up. Allen also pointed out an EPA web page indicating that nationally ozone levels in 2012 were down 9 percent compared to 2000 with NOx levels down 29 to 50 percent, depending on the measurement applied. Separately by email, commission spokesman Terry Clawson sent us a spreadsheet he described as the basis of the charts. Clawson said the data came from the EPA. Lets recap the charted changes in ozone, then NOx. Ozone down 23 percent According to a commission chart on a web page last updated April 17, 2014, ozone in Texas decreased 23 percent from 2000 through 2012, as Perry said. (The comparisons reflect what officials call fourth-high ozone readings. Clawson emailed us this technical explanation.) A headline on the chart says the ozone decrease for the other 49 states averaged 11 percent. Texas ran 12 percentage points ahead of that. The chart shows ozone decreasing in all but a few states--Wyoming, Utah, Idaho, Montana, South Dakota, Hawaii and Alaska--with the drop in Texas bested only by Tennessee, California and Georgia.  Source: Web page, Air Quality Successes - Criteria Pollutants, Texas Commission on Environmental Quality, last updated April 17, 2014 (accessed May 21, 2014) NOx from industrial sources down 62.5 percent In the period, Allen emailed, industrial emissions of NOx (not including motor vehicles) in Texas dropped 62.5 percent. He pointed out a commission chart indicating that industrial NOx emissions of more than 300,000 xx tons in 2011 compared to a shade less than 800,000 xx tons per year in 2000, which works out to a 62.5 percent reduction, as Perry said.  Source: Web page, Air Quality Successes - Emissions Inventory, Texas Commission on Environmental Quality, last updated April 17, 2014 (accessed May 21, 2014) Sierra Club stresses federal role For another perspective, we turned to Neil Carman of the Lone Star chapter of the Sierra Club. By phone, Carman called Perrys figures accurate though he suggested the cited reductions occurred mainly thanks to federal laws and enforcement. Carman, director of the clubs Clean Air program, said the federal government still considers the multi-county Houston and Dallas-Fort Worth areas as not attaining minimum ozone standards. He pointed out a Sierra Club press release stating the club on May 20, 2014, filed suit against the EPA for failing to classify Dallas-Fort Worth as having a severe ozone problem, an action that would have required polluters to clean the air, the press release says. By email, Carman said the governor's claim misleads by lumping together Texas' ozone woes in Houston and Dallas-Fort Worth with all the other ozone areas in the nation, including areas that have minimal or no problems. A comparison to other states with few ozone problems is roughly analogous to comparing a driver who gets 30 speeding tickets a year and reduces it by 50% over ten years to 15 per year, Carman said, while a second driver only had 3 tickets and reduces it by 33% to 2 tickets per year. The first driver had the greatest (percentage) reduction at 50% and the greatest volume reduction but also had the worst speeding record. Earlier, Clawson indicated the gains noted by Perry werent entirely due to federal oversight. By email, he noted a 1999 Texas law that required power plants to reduce NOx emissions, also saying other state laws enacted since 2000 stressed energy efficiency, reductions in pollution and renewable energy sources like wind power. Clawson, asked about the bulk of NOx pollution coming from vehicles and non-industrial sources, which Perrys statement did not take up, said NOx emissions from non-industrial sources in Texas in 2011 were 42 percent less than what such sources emitted in 1999. Our ruling Perry said that since 2000, Texas has reduced harmful pollutants in the air like nitrogen oxide by 62.5 percent, and ozone by 23 percent— a reduction that is 12 percent greater than the national average. Those figures are accurate, but the claim (like Perrys 2010 statement) takes into account only one NOx source — industrial — which it failed to note. Nearly three-quarters of NOx emissions come from other sources. Perrys declaration also didn't reflect on federal laws and oversight that figure into pollution reductions. Texas didnt make the gains in isolation. HALF TRUE – The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context.

15115,half-true,Dale Peterson,Says his opponent Dorman Grace brags on his Facebook page about receiving illegal campaign contributions.,"One of the most talked-about political ads of the primary election season comes courtesy of a relatively obscure race: the Republican primary for the Alabama Commissioner of Agriculture and Industries.It's the tough-talking, rifle-toting Dale Cowboy Peterson who propels the ad to an instant classic. To date, the ad has been viewed more 1.2 million times on YouTube. In it, Peterson aims his most pointed verbal attack against Republican primary opponent Dorman Grace.Dorman Grace brags on his Facebook page about receiving contributions from industries he would regulate. Bragging about receiving illegal money on Facebook. Who on earth would support such a dummy?It's one thing to call your opponent a dummy. It's another to call him a cheat. And so we decided to check out Peterson's claim that Grace was guilty of taking illegal campaign contributions. And then bragging about it on Facebook.Campaign finance reports submitted to the Alabama Secretary of State, and viewable online, show that Grace has taken contributions from several farms. Among them, deer and poultry farms. And on his Facebook page, Grace thanked some of the supporters who have contributed to his campaign, including some of the farmers in question.So are the contributions illegal?In 1998, the Alabama Legislature passed a law to prohibit the Commissioner of the Department of Agriculture and Industries or a candidate for the office of commissioner from accepting campaign contributions from persons associated with businesses regulated by the department.The contributions to Grace have given rise to several complaints with the state Ethics Commission -- not by Peterson -- but the commission has yet to rule on them.He's no expert on election laws, Peterson said in a phone interview with PolitiFact, but this seems pretty cut and dry.You can readily see that industries that we regulate, he's accepting money from them, Peterson said.End of story? Not necessarily.The Grace campaign says it has done nothing wrong because the contributions to the campaign don't come from industries regulated by the agriculture commissioner.Tullie Culverhouse, campaign manager for Grace, contends the law was intended to bar contributions from agencies regulated by the ag commissioner, such as fertilizer and pest control companies which have to come to the department for a permit to operate in Alabama.Poultry farms are not regulated by the department, Culverhouse said. They are serviced by the department. The only thing they do is serve the industry with disease control. This is frivolous.So those are the competing opinions of the two campaigns.We spoke with Glen Zorn, the assistant ag commissioner and Democratic candidate for the top agriculture job. Zorn doesn't think it would be accurate to say, for example, that poultry farms are regulated by thecommissioner. He hasn't taken any money from any poultry farmers, he said, but he would.The law about not accepting contributions from persons associated with businesses regulated by the department has never been tested, and remains a gray area, said Jeff Webb, legal advisor to the Agriculture Commissioner.We can go on anyone's property that is growing hens and make sure they are following all of the mandates to prevent outbreaks of infectious or contagious disease, Webb said. And so, he said, There is an argument that they are regulated by us.But there's a pretty good argument in the other direction, too, he said.Ray Hilburn, Poultry Program Director for the Alabama Department of Agriculture, said he doesn't view the department's role as a regulator of poultry farms.We regulate diseases, he said. We do disease work. We make sure the birds are disease-free. But we don't regulate the poultry growers themselves, in my opinion.Ultimately, it appears the state Ethics Commission is going to have to decide whether these contributions were improper (and it seems unlikely we'll hear a decision before next month's Republican primary). But we think it's fair to say that when the state's poultry program director and the legal advisor to the Alabama Department of Agriculture say the law is untested and unclear, it's a bit of a gray area. And so we rule Peterson's statement Half True."
7277,mostly-false,Planned Parenthood Action Fund,Says Mitt Romney wants to get rid of Planned Parenthood.,"In the final days of the 2012 presidential campaign, the Planned Parenthood Action fund released a radio ad in which a female narrator explains why she is supporting President Barack Obama.Ive been giving my vote a lot of thought, the ad says in part. For me, it all comes down to who I can trust, and whos best for my familys finances. And I just dont think Mitt Romney is looking out for us. Plus, his views on women seem like theyre from the 1950s. He wont say if he supports equal pay. Thats real money to us. And he says he wants to overturn Roe vs. Wade and get rid of Planned Parenthood. I know women who go to them for health care and affordable birth control.In this item, well focus on the ads claim that Romney wants to get rid of Planned Parenthood.Abortion opponents argue that federal funds should not go to a group like Planned Parenthood that provides abortions, even though federal funds are used for services other than abortion. Romney made a pledge to target Planned Parenthood several times -- but that pledge has never been as sweeping as the ad indicates.In October 2012, for instance, Romney told reporters in Ohio, I think Ive said time and again that Im a pro-life candidate and Ill be a pro-life president. The actions Ill take immediately is to remove funding for Planned Parenthood. It will not be part of my budget.And in March 2012, when asked by a Missouri interviewer what he would cut from the federal budget, Romney gave some examples. Of course you get rid of Obamacare, Romney said. Thats the easy one. But there are others. Planned Parenthood. Were going to get rid of that. The subsidy for Amtrak. We would eliminate that.Campaign officials clarified after the Missouri interview -- and confirmed to PolitiFact for this story -- that Romneys position is to eliminate federal payments to Planned Parenthood, but not to eliminate the organization.So the ad is wrong to say that Romney wants to get rid of Planned Parenthood.But is there a case that federal funding is so crucial to Planned Parenthood that it would be essentially crippled if federal funding went away?Planned Parenthood comes close to making this case.If a President Romney makes good on what hes promised during the campaign — after he ends safe and legal abortion, cuts off funding for womens preventive health care services, repeals the Affordable Care Act, and enacts abstinence-only sex education — there wouldnt be much left of Planned Parenthood, said a statement provided to PolitiFact attributed to Dawn Laguens, executive vice president, Planned Parenthood Action Fund.We cant predict the future, but we can provide some financial data that gives a sense of how important government funding is to Planned Parenthood.According to the groups most recent annual report, covering the year ending in June 2010, government health services grants and reimbursements amounted to $487 million, or 46 percent of the groups total revenue of $1.048 billion. (This figure includes both Planned Parenthoods headquarters as well as its affiliates.)The other sources of revenue listed were non-governmental health services revenue (31 percent), private contributions and bequests (21 percent) and other operating revenue (2 percent).There are some important caveats about these figures. Romney was talking about the federal budget, but the government line in Planned Parenthoods revenue statement includes funding from all levels of government, not just the federal government.Planned Parenthood did not provide PolitiFact with a more detailed breakdown of its government revenues, but we can obtain some clues from a 2010 study by the Government Accountability Office.In 2008, the most recent year for which GAO had full data, Planned Parenthood reported federal spending totaling $88.7 million. The biggest single amount was for services funded by the Health Resources and Services Administration, which directly funds low-income and rural health centers and runs such programs as the Ryan White HIV/AIDS program. Smaller amounts included funds for Temporary Assistance to Needy Families and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.In 2008, according to that years annual report, Planned Parenthood reported receiving about $349 million in government grants. By this measure, then, the federal funds cited by GAO accounted for about one-quarter of all government funds reported by the organization that year.The percentage may actually be higher. As we have previously noted, the GAO report counts only direct federal funding and does not appear to include reimbursements for patient services made through Medicaid or other federal health care programs. The group said that Medicaid patients account for about half of its patients, and if you include those who are funded by other federal programs, the percentage rises to two-thirds.Figuring out how much government funding could conceivably be eliminated by Romney if he wins office is mostly guesswork. But the hit to Planned Parenthood from Romneys elimination could range from a 12 percent reduction in its entire budget to perhaps a 35 percent cut.Would cutting that amount of funding from Planned Parenthoods budget effectively end the organization? That would be speculation -- but that speculation runs contrary to what Romney has said on multiple occasions.Our rulingThe Planned Parenthood Action Fund aid said that Romney wants to get rid of Planned Parenthood.That directly contradicts what Romney has said -- that he wants to end federal funding for Planned Parenthood, not abolish the organization -- and his staff reaffirmed that position. Theres no question that an end to federal funding would be a significant blow to the organizations operations, potentially chopping 12 percent to 35 percent from its budget. But its an exaggeration to say that Romney would act to get rid of the organization. UPDATE: After our story appeared, Planned Parenthood provided some additional statistics about how many Medicaid patients use their services. The story has been updated to include that data."
2302,mostly-false,Kelly Loeffler,Says Raphael Warnock celebrated Fidel Castro and welcomed him to his church.,"When Fidel Castro, the late communist leader of Cuba, spoke at Abyssinian Baptist Church in New York City in 1995, he was welcomed by cheers from a crowd of 1,300 and a hug from Harlems Democratic congressman, Charles Rangel. We have one of the great leaders of the world with us today, said the churchs pastor, the Rev. Calvin Butts, who was then interrupted by more cheers. The Rev. Raphael Warnock, then the youth pastor at Abyssinian, was not on the dais. But 25 years later, his connection to the church has been injected into a Jan. 5 election that will help determine which party controls the U.S. Senate. Warnock, now pastor of the Atlanta church where the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. once preached, is the Democratic challenger to Sen. Kelly Loeffler, R-Ga. With a guilt-by-association attack, Loeffler made this claim in a Nov. 10 tweet: @ReverendWarnock celebrated Fidel Castro & welcomed him to his church. Its another example of what weve been saying all along: Hes the most dangerous and radical candidate in America. Warnocks campaign has been vague about whether he attended the event, which was front-page news in the New York Times on Oct. 23, 1995. But there is no evidence Warnock was involved in arranging Castros appearance or welcoming him. And a Fox News article about Warnock and the event, which Loeffler included with her tweet, says only that Warnock worked at Abyssinian at the time. After President-elect Joe Bidens inauguration on Jan. 20, Democrats will control the White House and the House. Control of the Senate, where Republicans currently have a 50-48 edge, wont be known until after two Georgia runoff elections Jan. 5. Runoffs are being held because no candidate in either race on Nov. 3 captured more than 50% of the vote. Loeffler was appointed on an interim basis in December to replace GOP Sen. Johnny Isakson, who resigned with health problems. She finished second to Warnock on Nov. 3. In the other runoff, first-term GOP Sen. David Perdue faces Democrat Jon Ossoff, a documentary filmmaker; Perdue edged Ossoff on Nov. 3. If Democrats win both seats, they would effectively control the Senate, because as the next vice president, Kamala Harris could vote to break any ties. Castro appeared before 1,300 admirers at Abyssinian on the evening of Oct. 22, 1995, after speaking earlier in the day at the United Nations, the New York Times reported at the time. He held forth as if he were on a balcony overlooking a plaza in Havana, drinking in the cheers and applause that greeted his nearly every remark. Loeffler has repeated her attack on Warnock in a TV ad, on a website her campaign created to attack Warnock and at a campaign rally with Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla. Rubio also linked Warnock to the Castro event in a tweet, but didnt go as far as Loeffler did in her claim. Her campaign referred PolitiFact to a press release that recounted the New York event and repeated the attack, but did not offer evidence for her claim that Warnock celebrated or welcomed Castro. Warnock campaign spokesman Terrence Clark told PolitiFact that Warnock doesnt agree with the dictators beliefs and actions. He also wasnt making decisions about who spoke at the church when he was a youth pastor. Clark would not say whether Warnock attended the event. He also said Warnock would not be available for a five-minute phone interview that PolitiFact requested. We did not get replies to a call and email we left for Butts, who is still pastor at Abyssinian. Loeffler said Warnock celebrated Fidel Castro and welcomed him to his church. Warnock, now the pastor of a church in Atlanta, was the youth pastor at a New York City church when Castro spoke there in 1995. We found no evidence that Warnock celebrated or welcomed Castro or that he was involved in arranging his appearance.

17551,mostly-false,America First,"Says Joe Biden told Americans, If you elect me, your taxes are going to be raised, not cut.","A new ad from a pro-Trump super PAC uses out-of-context footage of Joe Biden to claim that the former vice president wants to raise taxes for Americans across the board. Versions of the ad from America First Action began airing Aug. 4 on Facebook and on TV screens in Wisconsin and North Carolina. They focus largely on a comment Biden made in response to a voter during a February campaign stop in South Carolina. But the America First Action ad presents that remark out of context. And while some tax experts estimate that Bidens plan would mean higher taxes on average for all income groups, those increases would be relatively small for all but the biggest earners.  The 30-second version of the ad opens with a narrator saying, Sometimes, politicians accidentally tell the truth, before cutting to the clip of Biden from the South Carolina event. Guess what, if you elect me, your taxes are going to be raised, not cut, Biden says. The ad replays the clip later, in between additional narration. The New York Times says Bidens tax increases are more than double Hillary Clintons plan. Even the Tax Policy Center admits taxes would increase on all income groups, the narrator says, before showing the clip a second time. Big tax increases, crushing our recovery. The spot finishes with Biden saying, It could go higher. America First Actions portrayal of Bidens comments in South Carolina gives the impression that Biden told a crowd that all Americans would have their tax rates raised on his watch. Thats not the case. When Biden said your taxes are going to be raised, not cut, he wasnt talking about his plan for all taxpayers. He was addressing one person at the February event. The person indicated that they had benefited from the Republican-led tax bill that became law under President Donald Trump. The exchange took place after Biden said, By the way, how many of you did really well with that $1.9 trillion tax cut? Really good shape, right? The crowd mostly laughed or groaned, but one member of the audience caught Bidens attention off camera by signaling that they benefited. Addressing that person directly, Biden said: Well, you did. Well, thats good. Im glad to see youre doing well already. But guess what, if you elect me, your taxes are going to be raised, not cut, if you benefited from that.  The full exchange shows that Biden was saying his plan would raise taxes for people who, in his words, benefited from the GOPs Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. A Biden campaign official said his point was that the wealthy — not all Americans — would not benefit from his plan. The ads portrayal of the exchange leaves a different impression. The same could be said of the ads second clip of Biden, in which he says, It could go higher. The ad doesnt specify what Biden was referring to when he made the remark. But the completeDecember interview with CNBC shows that Biden was talking specifically about the top tax rate for capital gains, the profits earned from selling property or investments, which are often taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income. We should charge people the same tax for their capital gains as their tax rate is, Biden said. And I think we should raise the tax rate back to, for example, I take it back to where it was before it was reduced. It could go higher.  America First Action frames Bidens tax plan as providing increases that are more than double Hillary Clintons plan and would impact all income groups. The ad cites a report from the New York Times and an editorial from the Wall Street Journal, both published in December, as well as a March 5 analysis from the Tax Policy Center, an independent group that models the effects of tax legislation. The New York Times said Biden was proposing more than double the tax increases proposed by Clinton, the Democratic presidential nominee in 2016. Thats accurate, said Gordon Mermin, a senior research associate at the Tax Policy Center and co-author of the March analysis. The Tax Policy Center estimated that Bidens proposals would raise revenues by 1.5% of gross domestic product over 10 years, Mermin said, citing what he said is the preferred metric for comparing across time. The groups analysis of the Clinton plan put that figure at 0.6% of GDP. But the America First Action ad was less exact in its claim that even the Tax Policy Center admits taxes would increase on all income groups. As FactCheck.org noted, thats a partial quote from the groups March report. The full sentence from the report said: In 2021, the proposals would increase taxes on average on all income groups, but the highest-income households would see substantially larger increases, both in dollar amounts and as a share of their incomes. Biden has publicly vowed not to raise taxes for those making less than $400,000 per year. His plan aims to raise up to $4 trillion in tax revenues over a decade, according to the Tax Policy Center, in part by rolling back some of the GOP-led tax laws tax cuts for corporations and for people with taxable incomes over $400,000. Among Bidens proposed changes, he would: Increase the top corporate tax rate to 28% from 21%. Raise the top individual federal income tax rate to 39.6%. Place a 12.4% Social Security tax on incomes above $400,000. Tax capital gains at the same rate as ordinary income for very high earners. The highest earners would bear the brunt of the new tax burden brought on by Bidens plan, according to the Tax Policy Center and other analyses of his proposals. The plan would lead to small, modest increases in costs for lower-income groups, Mermin said. But as weve reported, those changes would not be because of higher federal income tax rates across the board. Those small tax increases for the first four quintiles — and this is said in our brief — are almost all due to the indirect effects of the increase in the corporate tax rate, Mermin said, including lowered wages for workers. On average, the Tax Policy Centers March report predicted that the bottom 80% of earners could wind up paying between $30 and $590 extra annually on Bidens watch. It estimated that over 90% of the tax increases would be borne by the top 20% of earners. No direct taxes are imposed on any household making less than $400,000 per year, the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget wrote in its analysis of Bidens plan. RELATED: Facebook post wrongly claims Biden would hike tax rates for family earning $75,000 Biden has also added to his proposals since March, Mermin said, including pitching some tax credits that could potentially offset some of these increases for the middle-income folks. An America First Action ad showed Biden saying, Guess what, if you elect me, your taxes are going to be raised, not cut. The ad takes his words out of context. Biden was not speaking about the impact of his plan on all Americans. The comment came during a South Carolina event, when a member of his crowd said he or she had benefited from the GOP-led tax bill. The full context of the quote shows Biden saying that individuals taxes would be raised, not cut, if you benefited from that."
4529,mostly-false,Rick Perry,Only three in 10 Texas doctors are currently accepting new Medicaid patients.,"Saying Medicaid is a broken system that should not be expanded in Texas, Gov. Rick Perry and the states U.S. senators suggested many physicians decline to serve patients insured by the state-federal program. In an April 1, 2013, press release issued in conjunction with their joint Texas Capitol press conference, Perry and Sens. John Cornyn and Ted Cruz, all Republicans, said that nationally, Medicaid expenditures surged from 1990 to 2010, outpacing its caseload. Also, their press release said: Only three in 10 Texas doctors are currently accepting new Medicaid patients. Elaborating in the press conference, Perry said: And we fear that number may actually decrease if expansion went through. The 3-in-10 claim, brought to our attention by analyst Anne Dunkelberg of Austins liberal-leaning Center for Public Policy Priorities, sounded familiar, especially after spokespeople for Perry and each senator said by email that it was based on a 2012 survey of Texas physicians by the Texas Medical Association. Preliminary results from the survey figured into one of our fact checks earlier this year. Final survey results are now compiled, Donna Kinney, the associations lead researcher, told us by phone. Kinney said the results break out to 32 percent of Texas physicians saying they accept all new Medicaid patients and 42 percent declining all new Medicaid patients--with 26 percent limiting their new Medicaid patients. Put another way, the final results indicate that about four in 10 Texas physicians decline all new Medicaid patients while about six in 10 accept at least some new patients. They may accept them only in the emergency room, Kinney speculated. The limits could be anything. The groups Twitter post about the figure was missing clarification that the figure came from a survey. At the time, though, the Texas Health and Human Services Commission told us that some 67 percent of the states physicians had accepted Medicaid at least once during a recent 12-month period. Agency spokeswoman Stephanie Goodman told us by email that 34,290 Texas physicians had claims paid by Medicaid in the fiscal year that ran through August 2011. According to the Texas Medical Board, there were nearly 51,000 practicing physicians in the state at about that time.  Goodman said then that she did not have information on the share of physicians not accepting all new Medicaid patients.  Brent Annear, a medical association spokesman, guided us to a March 2012 web post by the group stating that 27,917 physicians and medical residents were asked to fill out its online survey and the group fielded 1,139 responses, a 4 percent response rate. The groups preliminary findings document says the respondents were a representative sample of all physicians. The survey reached members and non-members, Kinney told us by email.   The key question lists physician reimbursement methods including private insurance, Medicare and Medicaid. For patients covered by the following payers, the question says, does your practice currently (1) accept all new patients, (2) limit new patients that you will accept, or (3) accept no new patients? According to the final results, Kinney said, 32 percent said they accept all new Medicaid patients. Some 26 percent said they limit their new Medicaid patients, and 42 percent said they decline all new Medicaid patients, compared with 32 percent in 2010. For our previous check, Annear said by email that physicians have difficulties with Medicaids rates and bureaucratic hurdles that delay payments. The rates decreased four times from 2000 to 2011, an association spokeswoman, Pam Udall, said by email, though the state also agreed to a 25-percent boost in funds covering certain physician services provided to children on Medicaid, as part of resolving a lawsuit.  We asked Kinney to speculate on why nearly 70 percent of Texas physicians submitted at least one Medicaid claim in a recent year. She said about 60 percent of the states physicians--including many specialists in radiology, pathology and anesthesiology--must accept Medicaid to maintain their hospital admitting privileges. Those kinds of doctors would have responded to the survey by saying they limit new Medicaid patients, she said by phone.   For a real-world take, we ran the preliminary survey result by Austin opthalmologist Michelle Berger, the 2013 president of the Travis County Medical Society, which is affiliated with the medical association.  Berger said by phone that the society frequently fields inquiries from individuals newly on Medicaid seeking a doctor. Berger said she stopped accepting new Medicaid patients in her practice because related paperwork proved onerous and government payments, which have not kept up with inflation, were not quickly forthcoming. Then again, she said, doctors who do not accept new Medicaid patients may still provide charity care--the result being that some low-income patients are served even though their doctors do not seek payment. Asked to appraise the Texas leaders declaration--that only three in 10 physicians accept new Medicaid patients--Kinney said: The language does matter. They should have said all new patients. In emails, Perry spokesman Josh Havens and Cornyn spokeswoman Jessica Sandlin each said the leaders statement accurately reflected the association survey. Havens added that you cannot continue to add context to manipulate the result you want. Cruz spokeswoman Catherine Frazier, also standing by the claim, said by email that the point is that Medicaid is a broken system. Our ruling Perry said only three in 10 Texas doctors currently accept new Medicaid patients.  In a recent year, some 67 percent of Texas physicians submitted at least one Medicaid claim. More recently, 42 percent of the states physicians responding to a 2012 survey said they refuse all new Medicaid patients. Then again, 32 percent said they accept all new Medicaid patients and 26 percent said they limit such patients--signaling that 58 percent of physicians accept at least some new Medicaid patients. By not specifying that the cited three in 10 reflects only doctors who accept all new Medicaid patients, Perrys statement falls off target by nearly 30 percent. Still, it has en element of truth."
3695,mostly-false,Firearms Policy Coalition,Californias Proposition 63 would CRIMINALIZE the sharing of ammunition between friends who may be hunting or shooting together.," Proposition 63, a gun and ammunition control initiative on Californias November ballot, would require instant background checks for the sale of ammunition statewide. Known as the Safety For All Initiative and proposed by Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom, the measure is considered a significant addition to Californias already strict gun regulations. The initiative is in some cases more stringent than gun control bills introduced by state Senate leader Kevin De León and recently signed into law by Gov. Jerry Brown. Recently, a gun rights group, the Firearms Policy Coalition, in a June 16 email blast claimed Proposition 63 would restrict not only ammo sales, but criminalize the sharing of bullets between hunting and shooting partners. The Sacramento-based coalition describes itself as a grassroots nonprofit dedicated to defending Second Amendment rights. We decided to examine the claim: Would Proposition 63 really criminalizes the sharing of bullets between friends? Our research We started by checking the text of the Proposition. It broadly restricts ammunition sales by requiring instant background checks and requiring, by January 2018, all sales be conducted or processed through a licensed ammunition vendor, according to Section 8 of the text. Law enforcement would be exempted. Currently, the state does not require a license or record keeping for ammunition sales, according to the San Francisco-based Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence. By contrast, the restrictions Proposition 63 places on sharing or transferring ammunition are not as strict. Still, they would change some aspects of the largely unregulated practice. The measure would: -- Make it illegal for an individual to share bullets with any person who he or she knows or using reasonable care should know is banned from owning or possessing ammunition; -- Make it illegal for someone to share bullets if they know they will be subsequently sold or transferred to a person banned from owning them; -- Require individuals meet face-to-face to transfer ammunition; The new crimes would be classified as a misdemeanors, punishable by up to one year in jail and a $1,000 fine, according to the measure. They are listed under proposed changes to Sections 30306 and 30312 of the California Penal Code. They could still freely transfer and share that ammunition with their hunting and shooting partners provided that they do so in person and do not have knowledge that the ammunition would subsequently be provided to a felon or other prohibited person, Dan Newman, spokesman for the Safety For All Initiative, wrote in an email. Representatives from the Firearms Policy Coalition did not respond to our requests for comment. An AK-47 rifle 30-round magazine is seen with 30 rounds of 7.62x39mm ammunition, in Alexandria, Va., Wednesday, Feb. 10, 2016. (AP Photo/Cliff Owen) Our ruling The Firearms Policy Coalition recently claimed Californias Proposition 63 would Criminalize the sharing of ammunition between friends who may be hunting or shooting together. The initiative would create some new restrictions on bullet sharing. It would be it illegal to knowingly share bullets with a felon; to share with any other person banned from owning them; or with anyone who would subsequently share them with a banned person. It would also require people meet face-to-face to transfer ammunition. Breaking the new rules would be considered a misdemeanor. The coalitions statement, however, gives the wrong and overly broad impression that friends on a hunting trip or at a shooting range could never legally share a bullet -- that somehow the measure would criminalize all aspects of sharing a box of bullets with your shooting partner. Instead, the vast majority of people could keep sharing, as long as they know or within reason should know theyre not sharing with a felon or another person prohibited from owning a gun and ammunition. MOSTLY FALSE– The statement contains some element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.

11242,mostly-false,Donald Trump,Says Hillary Clinton wants to have open borders.,"Donald Trump says that Hillary Clinton wants open borders — a charge he has leveled again after an excerpt of one of her speeches leaked in a hacked email. We have no country if we have no border. Hillary wants to give amnesty, Trump said during the debate held at the University of Nevada-Las Vegas Oct. 19. She wants to have open borders. Clinton countered that she has supported border security for years and has included it in her presidential immigration plan. That prompted debate moderator Chris Wallace to ask Clinton to explain her remarks about open borders to the Brazilian bank Banco Itau in 2013. Here is that excerpt, as released by WikiLeaks: My dream is a hemispheric common market, with open trade and open borders, some time in the future with energy that is as green and sustainable as we can get it, powering growth and opportunity for every person in the hemisphere. At the debate, Clinton replied that her sentence from the speech related to energy. I was talking about energy. You know, we trade more energy with our neighbors than we trade with the rest of the world combined, she said. And I do want us to have an electric grid, an energy system that crosses borders. I think that will be great benefit to us. Trump shook his head, countering again: She wants open borders. People are going to pour into our country. We will fact-check whether Clinton is for open borders. Open borders At a rally in Pennsylvania earlier this month, Trump made a similar claim, that Clinton had made a radical call for open borders, meaning anyone in the world can enter the United States without any limit at all. The Trump campaign referred us to Clinton's pledge to offer immigration legislation within her first 100 days in office and to help Dreamers, children brought to the United States illegally as children. But that doesnt amount to wanting open borders. Clinton supported 2013 legislation (which never passed) that included a path to citizenship with conditions and billions for border enforcement for new surveillance equipment and fencing along the Mexican border, as well as adding 20,000 border agents. As a candidate, she has said she would focus on deportations for violent criminals or those who pose threats. Some experts disagree about what open borders means. Steven Camarota, a spokesman for the Center for Immigration Studies which advocates for low levels of immigration, says her focus on deporting violent criminals is only a small share of the undocumented population. That can reasonably be seen as open borders since almost all those who join the illegal population will not have to leave, rendering the current restrictions and limits mute, he said. Daniel Costa, director of immigration law and policy research at the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute, said Clinton hasnt released enough specifics about her plans such as her position on the future flow of migrant workers. Positions on these issues would shed a lot of light on whether or not she supports something approaching open borders (although the term open borders can mean many things), he said. But generally we heard from experts that although Clinton wants to make it easier for many undocumented immigrants to obtain legal status, thats not the same as getting rid of enforcement entirely and allowing open borders. Bank speech excerpt When WikiLeaks posted Clintons speech excerpt about open borders earlier this month, we asked immigration experts if her statement was a call for open borders for immigrants. The experts said Clintons remarks were not a clear-cut call for open borders. They also said that her statement sounded aspirational and contained no timeline or explanation as to how she would make it happen politically. (We asked the Clinton campaign for her full speech but did not get a reply to that request, so we can only evaluate the excerpt.) My guess would be that Clinton's Brazil speech reflects this broader call for greater hemispheric cooperation on a variety of issues, including trade, Stephen Kelly, a Duke University public policy professor. Given this context, and without seeing the rest of her speech, I would also guess that the open borders she mentions relate to the movement of goods and capital, but not people.  Daveed Gartenstein-Ross, senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, a policy institute focused on foreign policy and national security, said that Clinton seemed to refer to something related to travel such as the Schengen Agreement, which abolished many of the European Unions internal borders. For example, if the United States and Canada had such an agreement, that would not mean an open border for free immigration, but rather for free travel. I don't think she is calling for open immigration, but the context of her remarks shows that when she says open borders, she doesn't just mean open trade, he said. Jacob Vigdor, professor of public policy and governance at University of Washington, said Clinton appeared to be talking about both trade and immigration. I would read the remark as calling for open borders with regard to both trade and immigration. Otherwise the term open trade and open borders would be redundant, he said. However, he said he saw no timetable in her remarks beyond some time in the future, or discussion about how to make it happen. I don't necessarily see a contradiction between a statement of ideals and a more pragmatic policy agenda for reality, he said. One can dream of a crime-free world where there is need for neither police nor prisons while still supporting those things in reality. Our ruling Trump said that Clinton wants to have open borders. Although she wants to make it easier for some undocumented immigrants to stay here, she has repeatedly said she supports border security, so Trump is exaggerating when he says she wants open borders. In a brief speech excerpt from 2013, she called for a hemispheric common market, with open trade and open borders, some time in the future with energy that is as green and sustainable. Clinton has said she was talking about clean energy, but we cant fully evaluate her remarks to a bank because we dont have the full speech. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/c16e4a7b-33dc-4d39-a1ff-c739d65bf3a9"
17871,mostly-false,Wendy Davis,Greg Abbott did nothing to pursue reports of the sexual abuse of boys at a West Texas state-run school.,"In a TV ad suggesting Greg Abbott failed to act when allegations of misconduct came to his office, Wendy Davis reminds Texans of the sexual abuse scandal that touched off a 2007 legislative overhaul of the Texas Youth Commission. In the ad, a narrator says in a dark tone: Young boys at a state-run school are sexually abused. When a local investigation lags, a Texas Ranger notifies Attorney General Greg Abbott, asking him to investigate. Abbott does nothing, the narrator says, adding that 11 months then went by with more incidents of abuse and neglect. But Abbott didnt pursue the case, the narrator says. By way of backup, the Davis campaign offered news stories describing attempts by a Texas Ranger to get authorities outside of West Texas, including the attorney general, to look into the alleged incidents at the West Texas State School in Pyote. We reviewed those news reports and others, which together chronicled initial inaction by a state lawyer before Abbotts office presented the related allegations to a grand jury. Abbott does nothing? Public knowledge of alleged sexual wrongdoing by officials at the remote school traces to February 2007 news reports by the Texas Observer and Dallas Morning News. But a Texas Ranger, Brian Burzynski, had been on the case for years and had already reached out to the state for help. Burzynski emailed an assistant state attorney general, Will Tatum, on Feb. 21, 2006, graphically detailing sexual abuse of male youths at the school, according to information released by Abbotts office in March 2007. The Rangers email said the local prosecutor had the case but hasn't done anything with it and I am losing hope that he will. ... I would like you to view this report and tell me what you think. Burzynski had begun his investigation in February 2005. According to Abbotts office, Tatum declined to pursue the case because of jurisdictional concerns; under state law, the attorney generals office needed a local prosecutor to ask for assistance before it could get involved. As Burzynskis emailed request became public, Abbotts state spokesman, Jerry Strickland, said Tatum still should have forwarded the report to his supervisors before responding to the email, but he didn't follow agency procedures, according to news reports at the time. Knowing the seriousness of the allegations contained in that email, action would have been taken by the attorney general's office, and this agency would have actively engaged in the matter in any way possible, Strickland said. But Strickland also said that two days after Burzynski sent the email, Tatum correctly told the Ranger that the Ward County district attorney, Randall Reynolds, would have to ask Abbott's office for help on the case. An April 2007 Austin American-Statesman news story said Tatum sent Burzynski the name and address of his supervisor, Adrien McFarland, for the Ranger to give to Reynolds. Abbott acted in 2007 Strickland said the attorney general's office began an aggressive investigation after Reynolds asked for help; that request came in Jan. 17, 2007. In April 2007, a Ward County grand jury returned 13 indictments against two former school administrators for improper sexual conduct with six students, ages 16-19, the attorney generals office announced at the time. Abbott and other state prosecutors appeared before the grand jury to present the charges against former Texas Youth Commission officials Ray Edward Brookins and John Paul Hernandez, Abbotts office said. Abbott said at the time: With today's indictments, the victims of sexual abuse at West Texas State School are a step closer to the justice they deserve. According to the state announcement, on April 4, 2007, District Judge Bob Parks had granted the attorney generals office sole authority to investigate and prosecute allegations of abuse at the Ward County facility. Parks appointed the attorney general as District Attorney Pro Tem after the local district attorney recused himself from the case, the announcement said. Footnote: In April 2010, a jury sentenced Brookins to 10 years in prison on his conviction for sexual relations with a teenage inmate. In 2011, a jury acquitted Hernandez on 14 counts of molesting boys in 2004 and 2005. Texas law on the attorney general and criminal prosecutions Generally, the April 2007 Statesman news story pointed out, the Texas attorney general is an executive who primarily defends the state in civil disputes, though in local criminal cases involving fraud in insurance, Medicaid or elections, the attorney general can usually find a way to involve himself, one way or another. His staff, using a provision in the penal code dealing with computer crimes, can even initiate investigations into the solicitation of sex from minors on the Internet. Charges like the ones from West Texas, the story said, are off-limits until a local prosecutor requests assistance in writing. Eric Nichols, deputy attorney general for criminal justice, told the newspaper the state agency followed the letter of the law. At the time, the Texas Government Code said: A prosecuting attorney may request the assistance of the attorney general in the prosecution of all manner of criminal cases or in performing any duty imposed by law on the prosecuting attorney. In requesting such assistance, a prosecuting attorney may appoint any assistant attorney general as an assistant prosecuting attorney. The 2007 Legislature amended the law to say the attorney general may offer assistance in any criminal prosecution. Another adopted revision: The attorney general may offer assistance in the prosecution of criminal offenses concerning the Texas Youth Commission. The Statesman story said two lawmakers, Democratic Reps. Jim McReynolds of Lufkin and Jim Dunnam of Waco, questioned Nichols about whether Abbotts office should initially have done more: Even if he couldn't initiate prosecution, couldn't he have picked up the phone and called Reynolds, or even the governor, the state's chief executive officer? Nichols said in an interview at the time that Abbotts aides assumed the local prosecutor was doing his job. Do you automatically draw the conclusion that nothing is going to happen? Nichols asked. On the other hand, the Statesman story said, it might not have mattered whether someone in the attorney general's office called Reynolds to offer help. Burzynski told lawmakers in 2007 that Reynolds continually assured him he would prosecute the case. The story said Reynolds had said little in his defense except to blame politics or a breakdown in communications. A timeline accompanying the story said Abbott learned of the West Texas investigation at a meeting of senior agency staff Jan. 22, 2007. On March 9, 2007, Abbott announced the grand jury would soon begin hearing the case. Our ruling In her ad, Davis said Greg Abbott did nothing to pursue reports of the sexual abuse of boys at a state-run school. In 2006, Abbotts office reacted to a Rangers report detailing such allegations by saying a local prosecutor needed to seek state assistance--and a state lawyer reportedly did nothing more. But this charge ignores a pivotal development. In 2007, after the local prosecutor requested help, state attorneys overseen by Abbott steered a grand-jury presentation leading to indictments.

9711,mostly-false,Jeb Bush,Eliminating affirmative action in admissions in Florida led to more African American and Hispanic kids attending our university system than before.,"Former Gov. Jeb Bush still hasnt announced a 2016 presidential run, but he is trumpeting his conservative record on subjects like affirmative action. I eliminated affirmative action by executive order -- trust me, there were a lot of people upset about this, Bush said at the Conservative Political Action Conference on Feb. 27, 2015. But through hard work we ended up having a system where there were more African American and Hispanic kids attending our university system than prior to the system that was discriminatory. Its been some time since Bush ended race-based admissions policies, so we wondered if more African American and Hispanic students are attending state universities now than when affirmative action was in place. 'One Florida' Bush signed an executive order implementing the One Florida plan in 1999, which banned racial preference in state school admissions. It also created a program guaranteeing that the top 20 percent of high school graduates would gain admission to a post-secondary institution and some funding for need-based financial aid. Florida is now one of a handful of states preventing race-based admissions policies and the only one to do so by executive order. Other states had done so by ballot initiative, a route that ran into obstacles in Florida when supporters tried and failed to put a constitutional amendment on the 2000 ballot. Bushs spokeswoman did not comment, but the first thing we should note is that in terms of sheer numbers, Bush has some evidence to back himself up. From 1999 to 2013, the latest year for which data is available, overall enrollmentfor black students went up from about 33,000 to almost 44,000. It was the same for Hispanics (students from a Spanish-speaking culture), which shot up from just less than 33,000 students to almost 80,000. But those numbers were going up as overall enrollment was going up dramatically. From 1999 to 2013, the State University System increased enrollment by 45 percent, much higher than the national average of around 25 percent in the same time period. The question really is, did the ratio of black and Hispanic enrollmentgo up after Bushs executive order? Well, yes and no. We took a look at all state university fall enrollment, broken down by black and Hispanic students, going back to 1995. Data from the Florida Board of Governors show that black enrollmentdeclined slightly in recent years from 14 percent in 1999 to 13 percent in 2013. Hispanic enrollment, meanwhile, have almost doubled to nearly 24 percent. One thing to keep in mind is that post-2010 data cant be fairly compared to pre-2010 data. Thats because the U.S. Department of Education in 2007 decided to change racial and ethnic classifications by the 2011-12 school year. The new categories included a multiple races choice and weighted classifications for students who answered yes when asked if they are Hispanic. Choosing Hispanic overrides racial selections and results in more students categorized as Hispanic. The reclassification also has resulted in fewer students reporting as black and white, according to the Florida Board of Governors, which oversees the State University System. But as the graph shows, the trend for more students to report as Hispanic started even before the Department of Education decided to change the categories. Experts told us there are several reasons for these changes, but it doesnt appear its because of the One Florida program. Troy Miller, associate director for research and policy for the student advocacy group the Florida College Access Network, said demographics are part of the equation. Overall enrollment is up because there are more K-12 students in the state than there were in 1999, and more of them (including black and Hispanic students) are graduating than before. Also, college admissions are going up in large part because of the Bright Futures program, started in 1997. Our ruling Bush said that eliminating affirmative action in admissions led to more African American and Hispanic kids attending our university system universities than before. The raw numbers of black and Hispanic students are up, but the percentage of black students in the State University System is down slightly since Bushs 1999 executive order. The number of Hispanic students has gone up considerably, but that is partly because of a recent change in how students report ethnicity during the admissions process. Theres no hard evidence Bushs One Florida program had much to do with the enrollment changes. Experts say demographics, graduation rates and state-sponsored scholarship money have had more influence.

16255,mostly-false,Nathan Deal,A substantial number of probationers participating in a pilot project to ease the farm labor shortage are able to finish the work.,"Gov. Nathan Deals plan to use probationers to ease the states farm labor shortage has farmers wondering whether these new workers can take the heat. Literally.Temperatures soar into the 90s in Georgias fields. Harvesters spend hours in the sun stooping, bending and carrying heavy baskets of fruits and vegetables.Hispanic immigrant workers, some here illegally, usually take on this backbreaking labor, but farmers say theyre leaving the state because of the states tough new immigration laws. Probationers taking their place have trouble lasting even one day, according to media reports.WABE-FM (90.1) host Denis OHayer asked Deal about the probationers during a June 16 interview. From a practical point of view, does that say to you that this experiment may not work? OHayre asked.Well, theres no question it is difficult and hard work. I think you know that when you get into the field, Deal replied. But our reports are a substantial number of them were actually able to finish the work.Opponents of Georgias recent immigration crackdown often complain that most Americans dont want or cant handle field work and other jobs performed by legal and illegal immigrants.So, we wondered, have a substantial number of Georgias probationers really been able to withstand a full days work in the fields?Probationers are offenders who serve their sentences outside of prison. Generally, they must be employed to meet the terms of their probation.The DOC supervises about 8,000 probationers in South Georgia, the heart of the states agricultural industry. Some 2,000 of them are unemployed, according to the department.Deals pilot program started the week of June 13, soon after a survey by the state Department of Agriculture determined that farmers were short 11,080 workers. By then, the vegetable harvest season was already ending and growers complained crops were rotting in the fields.The pilot program invites low-risk, non-violent probationers to work voluntarily in the fields for $7.25 an hour or more. As of June 20, two farms in Sumter and Colquitt counties have hired probationers as part of the pilot, and the probation office in a third county, Echols, is also participating.We asked Deals office for proof that a substantial number of probationers finished the work. A spokeswoman directed us to the Georgia Department of Corrections, which has joined with the state departments of Labor and Agriculture to run the pilot project.Corrections spokeswoman Gwendolyn Hogan emphasized the pilot program is just getting started. Many qualified probationers have yet to be told about it, and its too early to say how well they fill the states farm labor needs.Hogan gave few specifics on worker turnover, saying the numbers are still being collected and reviewed. But she says that when the program began June 13, the number of participants each day was in the single digits. As of June 20, 10, 11 or 12 were showing up for work. During the first week, an average of seven probationers worked each day in Sumter County, Hogan said. An average of five or so were repeat workers.We contacted the Georgia Fruit and Vegetable Growers Association for more information. Both farms participating in the pilot project are part of the group, which opposed the immigration crackdown.Executive Director Charles Hall stressed that its too early to pass judgment on the pilot program. Growers may be unable to tell how well it works until after the fall harvest.This may be a good alternative. It may be a partial solution, Hall said. It will take us some time to work through.In Sumter County, the program began Monday June 13, when three probationers showed up for work, Hall said. None of them returned the next day.On Tuesday, two arrived and worked all day.One of them returned Wednesday, and nine new recruits joined him. Six of the 10 probationers who showed up worked most of the day. In Colquitt County, the program started June 18, Nine of 11 probationers made it through the work day, Hall said. Five returned the next day.  Since then, Agricultural Commissioner Gary Black has said publicly that the program has had mixed results so far. Black told WXIA-TV 11 and Georgia Public Broadcasting that only two farms had signed up and a number of probationers werent returning to work. He remained cautiously optimistic the program could be refined for the fall harvest.The Associated Press reported similar problems. Probationers came to work without gloves and other protective clothing. They couldnt keep up with the Hispanic crews and wilted in the heat.Deal spokeswoman Stephanie Mayfield said that the number of probationers who stick it out still count as substantial.Given that we arent trying to fill all our agricultural labor needs with probationers, the turnout has been substantial for a few farms in South Georgia, and were working hard in conjunction with the Departments of Agriculture, Corrections and Labor to expand the program, Mayfield wrote us in an email.Lets sum up.Deal said substantial number of probationers finished the work, but this claim has serious shortcomings.You could argue that since 7 out of 14 probationers returned the next day for more work, the program had a 50 percent success rate. To some, 50 percent might seem substantial. The work is difficult and newbies often drop out.But the pilot program was designed to place some of South Georgias 2,000 unemployed probationers in the states 11,000 empty harvesting slots. Participation rates of potentially eligible probationers is so low that its premature, and even bit misleading, to say that substantial numbers of probationers have finished the work.Substantial numbers of probationers have yet to even participate in the program. Deal was misleading. But well be generous and give him some credit for the fact that half of the pilots 14 participants returned to the fields for more backbreaking labor. Deal earns a Barely True."
2179,mostly-false,Shelley Moore Capito,"A study shows that households neighboring West Virginia could be on the hook for upwards of $70,000 in the first year alone under the Green New Deal!","Republicans have focused their attacks on a congressional Democratic proposal known as the Green New Deal. The proposal, whose highest-profile champion is Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., is aimed at curbing climate change, but Republicans counter that its associated costs will wreck the economy. The House version of the proposal has far-reaching environmental goals, including eliminating pollution and greenhouse gas emissions as much as technologically feasible. It reaches into other domestic policy areas, as well. One of the GOP lawmakers who took a shot at the Green New Deal is West Virginia Sen. Shelley Moore Capito. Capito took the proposal to task in an Aug. 20 Facebook post: Democrats are desperate to implement their Green New Deal. They care little about the cost and will leave you with the bill! A study shows that households neighboring West Virginia could be on the hook for upwards of $70,000 in the first year alone under the Green New Deal! This doesnt sound like much of a deal to us!  Capitos congressional and campaign offices declined to comment for this article, but her Facebook post linked to a Fox Business article that, in turn, cited a study by the Competitive Enterprise Institute on the household effects of the Green New Deal, or GND. At a minimum, the GND would impose large and recurring costs on American households, the study said. We conclude that in four of the five states analyzed — Florida, New Hampshire, New Mexico, and Pennsylvania — the GND would cost a typical household more than $70,000 in the first year of implementation, approximately $45,000 for each of the next four years, and more than $37,000 each year thereafter. Pennsylvanians could expect a $72,439 hit. In the fifth state, Alaska, the costs would be the highest of all. Travis Burk, a CEI spokesman, said Capitos Facebook statement accurately described the study. The study looked at the available data in those states and estimated increased costs for electricity production, upgrading vehicles and housing, and elements of shipping, Burk said. In the interest of fairness, the study is transparent about the inability to estimate a price tag for several of the more costly but vaguely-worded elements of the plan, including a universal job guarantee and guaranteed retirement security for all. Adding in those other elements would mean that Capito was underestimating the potential costs, Burk said. There is little doubt that a proposal as sweeping as the Green New Deal would come with a significant price tag. Where Capitos assertion falls short is in its specificity. The Competitive Enterprise Institute is dedicated to advancing the principles of limited government, free enterprise, and individual liberty, according to its website — so its not surprising that the group would be skeptical of a pro-regulatory plan like the Green New Deal. More to the point, Capito glosses over some of the studys shortcomings. The Green New Deal is an aspirational blueprint rather than a binding piece of legislation. The proposal doesnt lay out any cost figures. And it has not received a cost estimate by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office — the gold-standard source on such estimates. As a result, the details of the proposal are vague and open to a range of interpretations. The study itself acknowledges that its calculations require a considerable number of assumptions — assumptions that other policy specialists say will make specific figures hard to pin down. We have previously fact-checked a statement that, at $93 trillion, the Green New Deal would cost more than the entire recorded spending of the U.S. since the Constitution went into effect in 1789. The $93 trillion figure comes from a high-end estimate by a conservative group, the American Action Forum. The CEI study that Capito relied on cited the American Action Forum as a key source for its own calculations. As we noted at the time, the American Action Forum report described its estimates as an initial foray, filled with assumptions and caveats. The Green New Deal lacks too many details to seriously model, Howard Gleckman, a senior fellow at the Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center, told PolitiFact West Virginia. Capito wrote that a study shows that households neighboring West Virginia could be on the hook for upwards of $70,000 in the first year alone under the Green New Deal! Capito cites a study by an anti-regulation group that estimated that the one-year cost to a household in neighboring Pennsylvania would be $72,439. However, experts warn that the costs associated with the Green New Deal are too fuzzy at this point to come up with detailed cost estimates. This position is echoed by the report itself, which acknowledges that its calculations require a considerable number of assumptions. Its also worth noting that the resolution would be non-binding — if it actually manages to secure congressional approval. EDITORS NOTE, Oct. 10, 2019: This version of the article has beenupdated with a statement from the Competitive Enterprise Institute. The rating does not change."
17078,mostly-false,Florida Democratic Party,Says Mitt Romney belittled middle-class tax cuts as nothing more than 'little Band-Aids.' ,"As the president pressured Congress to extend his payroll tax cut, Florida Democrats issued a statement calling Republican opposition shameful.With Republicans like Mitt Romney belittling middle-class tax cuts as nothing more than 'little Band-Aids,' the Republican Party is sending a clear signal to the American people: they are willing to raise taxes on middle-class Americans just to pay for more tax breaks for millionaires and billionaires and big oil, says a quote from Florida Democratic Party executive director Scott Arceneaux.The phrase little Band-Aids caught our eye. Did Mitt Romney really use that phrase to describe tax cuts for the middle-class?We asked Florida Democratic Party spokeswoman Brannon Jordan, who issued the Dec. 1, 2011, release, contacted the Romney campaign and searched for the phrase ourselves.What emerged wasn't quite what Democrats had claimed.What Romney saidRomney did use the phrase little Band-Aids in an Oct. 11 presidential debate, in his answer to a question about Obama's effort to extend his payroll tax cut. Here's how the exchange with Bloomberg TV White House correspondent Juliana Goldman unfolded: Democrats seized on the conversation as evidence that Romney opposed extending payroll tax cuts, which the Obama administration says save a typical family $1,000 a year. Within days, the Democratic National Committee rolled out Operation Band-Aids, including a Web video, conference calls and events.By opposing the extension of middle-class tax cuts, (Romney) is supporting a tax increase on middle-income families and small businesses, POLITICO quoted DNC communications director Brad Woodhouse as saying.Romney's tax planOf course, a closer reading of the debate shows Romney opposed the tax cuts, not on their merits or because of whom they would benefit but rather as temporary cuts rather than long-term changes.The right course, he said, was to make permanent changes to the tax code. He criticized a temporary change to the payroll tax, calling it a temporary shift in a tax stimulus before he concluded he didn't like temporary little Band-Aids.His opposition to temporary tax code fixes wasn't a new point.Page 39 of his economic plan, released in early September, says, President Obamas proclivity for fostering uncertainty about the long-term shape of the tax code is particularly troublesome. He has embraced one temporary solution after the next while rejecting permanent adjustments that would bring some predictability and stability to investment decision-making.That's the essence of his Oct. 11 debate answer. And it's scarcely a blanket opposition to middle-class tax cuts, as Democrats characterized it.In fact, he had previously exempted the payroll tax cut extension from his criticism.On Page 47, he mentioned some short-term measures he would support — and a lower payroll tax is among them. So the Democrats were right to seize on Romney's debate answer in one sense: It differed from his on-the-record support for a lower payroll tax as distinct from other counterproductive short-term measures. In the debate, he instead grouped Obama's proposed tax cut extension into his criticism of short-term fixes.That departure didn't last long. Days after Florida Democrats' news release, Romney returned to the talking points of his published economic plan in an appearance on Michael Medved's conservative radio talk show:I would like to see the payroll tax cut extended just because I know that working families are really feeling the pinch right now — middle-class Americans are having a hard time, he said on the Dec. 5 show, as reported by the New York Times and others.Meanwhile, the details of his economic plan, while too vague for a complete analysis, appear to support lower taxes for the middle class, according to Bob Williams of the Tax Policy Center. The center maintains a summary of Republican candidates' tax proposals.He wants lower rates in the future for taxes, Williams said. ... I would say it's not fair to say he doesn't care about the little guys.Romney would maintain President George W. Bush's tax cuts, which include cuts for the middle class (though also, of course, for the rich). He wants to reduce to zero investment taxes for low- and middle-income families to boost their retirement savings — something he doesn't offer to do for those with adjusted gross incomes over $200,000. In the long-term, he wants to broaden the tax base and reduce and flatten tax rates, which would likely favor the wealthy more than anyone else, Williams said, but he would keep exemptions, deductions, credits, and other tax preferences in the short-term, many of which benefit lower- and middle-income taxpayers. He wants lower rates across the board.And, as we said, his published plan says he supports a temporary reduction in the payroll tax if properly structured. Our rulingFlorida Democrats used Romney as an example of a Republican willing to raise taxes on middle-class Americans just to pay for more tax breaks for millionaires and billionaires. They accused him of belittling middle-class tax cuts as nothing more than 'little Band-Aids.'But the context of his Oct. 11 debate performance shows he decries not middle-class tax cuts, but a temporary change to the payroll tax as part of a stimulus bill. He argued, essentially, for permanently lower tax rates, including for the middle class.Meanwhile, the debate performance stands as an exception to Romney's published support for lowering payroll taxes.Democrats get some credit for accurately pointing out that in the debate, Romney didn't support Obama's effort to extend his payroll tax cut. He did indeed call temporary tax changes little Band-Aids. But they ignore critical context from the debate and Romney's published tax proposals when they declare he belittled middle-class tax cuts, creating the impression he opposes middle class-tax breaks."
12074,mostly-false,Newt Gingrich,Ben Bernanke has been the most inflationary chairman in the history of the Federal Reserve.,"The Republican candidates for president aimed most of their rhetorical ammunition during Wednesdays debate at President Obama, but there were a few shots at Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke.One verbal attack by former U.S. House Speaker Newt Gingrich at Bernanke caught our attention.I think he's been the most inflationary, dangerous and power-centered chairman of the Fed in the history of the Fed, said Gingrich, a former U.S. House member from the Atlanta suburbs.The Federal Reserve is the central bank of the United States and tries to make sure the nations monetary and credit conditions are stable. The Republican field for president have all been critical of the economic policies of Obama, a Democrat, focusing on issues like the nations high unemployment rate and his desire to end tax cuts for the wealthiest earners. Some of that criticism has befallen Bernanke, who was first nominated to the position by President George W. Bush, a Republican, during the latter part of his administration.The parts about Bernanke being dangerous and power-centered seemed grist for debate among political wonks. Inflationary sounded like something easier to check with data, a claim worthy of the Truth-O-Meter.Heres what we found.Gingrich spokesman R.C. Hammond explained the basis of his comments, along with forwarding a speech the candidate made in June to the Atlanta Press Club.Newt's comments were based on reports of unaccounted spending reaching into the billions the Fed has doled out over the past few years, Hammond told us in an e-mail.In that speech, Gingrich criticized Bernankes support for the 2008 bank bailout and says some Fed policies weaken the U.S. dollar by promoting inflation.For example, the Fed might increase the money supply substantially in the belief that such monetary expansion will spark economic growth, Gingrich said. But a Fed that floods the economy with new dollars in an attempt to stimulate economic growth and new jobs is a Fed that decreases the value of every dollar in every Americans pocket through higher inflation, making every American poorer.Look at what has already happened, Gingrich continued. Today, we have a dollar that is stunningly weaker than it used to be, and the price of everything from gasoline to groceries is steadily drifting upward.Bernanke is the 14th chairman of the Federal Reserve. The first was Charles S. Hamlin, an attorney and former assistant Treasury Department secretary who served from August 1914 to August 1916. The tenures varied, from two to three years in the case of Hamlin, Roy Young and Eugene Meyer, to nearly 19 years in the case of Alan Greenspan, who served from August 1987 through January 2006. Bernanke became Fed chairman in February 2006.We looked at the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics Consumer Price Index, which measures the prices nearly 90 percent of Americans pay for goods and services and is used by most economists to determine inflation rates.The bureau keeps annual data on the change to the index. Since some Fed chairmen did not serve an entire year, we only used full years to make a comparison. In 1958, the bureau decided to track the index in two ways, with and without including food and energy. Some economists dont like to include food and energy because they fluctuate more than other costs. We didnt find much of a difference in the annual change if you excluded food and energy.The highest average annual index was nearly 11 percent, which occurred under Chairman William P.G. Harding from 1917 to 1921. The second-highest rate was from 1971 to 1977, when Arthur Burns was chairman. The annual average index between 2007, the first full year of Bernankes term, to 2010 was just below 2 percent. Bernanke was in the middle of the pack in comparison to the other Fed chairmen.Barry Bosworth, an economics expert at the liberal/centrist-leaning Brookings Institution, said he would use a similar method to measure Bernanke. The percentage he found under Bernanke was nearly the same.It is unusually low, said Bosworth.We also tried another method to see if Gingrich had a point. We used the bureaus index inflation calculator. We looked at how much $100 was worth in the first year of each chairmans term and the last year. Harding, again, had the highest average percentage change. Bernanke, again, was in the middle of the pack.Dan Mitchell, whose biography says he worked as an economist for former U.S. Sen. Bob Packwood (R-Ore.), believes the index is not the best way to measure inflation.[I]nflation can then show up in various ways - a rising CPI, an asset bubble, excess reserves redeposited at the Fed, etc. I'm not saying Gingrich is necessarily right. But I am saying that CPI is not the right variable, (though that's how the average thinks of it), Mitchell said.Mitchell, a senior fellow at the Libertarian-leaning Cato Institute, contends that inflation is the creation of excess liquidity by the central bank. The definition is similar to Gingrichs argument that Bernanke flooded the economy with too many dollars.J.D. Foster, an economist whose biography says he worked in the White House Office of Management and Budget, told us that inflation is accelerating, but still low. He said some of Bernankes policies could result in much higher rates.There is a long and variable delay between monetary policy actions and inflationary effects. So looking at today's inflation really doesn't tell you much about future inflation. Therein can one defend with no trouble Gingrich's comments about inflation, said Foster, who worked at the conservative-leaning Heritage Foundation.Donald Ratajczak, a leading economist and former director of Georgia State Universitys Economic Forecasting Center, said (Bernanke) has been one of the least inflationary Fed chairmen.Ratajczak said the only rationale he could consider is that Gingrich was referring to the expansion of assets of the Federal Reserve.But thats not the same thing, said Ratajczak, who still writes a weekly commentary on the economy for Morgan Keegan, an investment firm.Our ruling:Gingrich is making the point that Bernanke has created a huge pool of liquidity that is raising inflationary pressures to levels never seen under previous Fed chairmen.However, the current CPI rates are still low, and Gingrichs concerns havent been seen in Consumer Price Index averages, which are widely used to monitor inflation. The index has been higher under other Fed chairmen, and Bernanke is in the middle under such a comparison."
18115,mostly-false,Senate Democrats,El precio de combustible ha aumentado un 25% este año / The price of gas has increased 25% this year.," Cable news is focused on the investigations surrounding President Donald Trump, but theres an issue of intense interest to many Americans that has gotten relatively little media play recently — a rise in prices at the pump. On May 23, Senate Democrats tried to change the media narrative by holding a news event at a gas station near Capitol Hill. The Senate Democrats collective Twitter account documented the event. The account posted a Spanish-language tweet featuring a clip of Sen. Bob Menendez, D-N.J., talking about high gasoline prices and placing the blame on Trump. The Spanish-language text says: El precio de combustible ha aumentado un 25% este año. Los analistas dicen que el presidente tiene la culpa. Gracias @realDonaldTrump. In English, that translates as: The price of gas has increased 25% this year. Analysts say the president is to blame. Thanks, Trump. (Menendez, speaking in Spanish in the tweets uploaded video clip, didnt use those exact words and didnt cite a percentage increase.) So is the tweet correct that gas prices are up 25 percent since the start of the year? Not quite. While prices have increased, they havent risen by that much. We turned to data from the Energy Information Administration, a federal statistical clearinghouse. We found that retail gasoline prices were $2.52 a gallon on Jan. 1, 2018, and rose to $2.92 on May 21, 2018. Thats an increase of 15.9 percent — a distinct bump, but smaller than the tweet had said. When we looked at crude oil prices, the increase was a bit larger than for gasoline but still not 25 percent. On Jan. 2, 2018, crude was $60.37 a barrel and on May 21 it was $72.26. Thats an increase of 19.7 percent. Sandy Fielden, a commodities analyst at Morningstar Inc., told thestreet.com in late April that Trump may be at least a partial cause of the price rise, citing threats of a trade war with China, heightened tensions in the Middle East, and the U.S. exit from the Iran nuclear deal, Fielden said. All these bearish factors pushing prices higher are arguably directly caused by Trump administration policies, Fielden told the website. Trumps suggestion that the OPEC oil-producing companies may be to blame for higher prices is definitely a case of the pot calling the kettle black. After we inquired with the Democratic Senate leadership, the tweet was deleted and a replacement was posted. The new tweets caption stuck closely to Menendez wording in the video, saying, El precio de gasolina sigue subiendo y subiendo. Y es por consecuencia, en gran parte, de la política del presidente. (That translates as, The price of gasoline keeps rising and rising. And it is, to a large extent, due to the president's policies.) The Democratic staff on the Senate Finance Committee subsequently told PolitiFact that the 25 percent figure stemmed from a math error and has since corrected the report it came from. El precio de gasolina sigue subiendo y subiendo. Y es por consecuencia, en gran parte, de la política del presidente. pic.twitter.com/yLbrmBwtxR The original version of the tweet said, El precio de combustible ha aumentado un 25% este año, which translates as, The price of gas has increased 25% this year. Gas prices have risen, but not by that much — 15.9 percent, rather than 25 percent."

14373,mostly-false,Joe Biden,The fact is that right now the vast majority of Democrats do not support Medicare for All.,"When the subject of Medicare for All came up during the Democratic debate last week, former Vice President Joe Biden claimed that the majority of his party does not favor it. The fact is that right now the vast majority of Democrats do not support Medicare for All, he said, adding, It couldn't pass the United States Senate right now with Democrats. It couldn't pass the House.  This seemed to be a very strong statement, and we werent sure that voters positions on this issue were as clear-cut as Biden made them out to be, so we asked his campaign where he got the information. Public opinion The Biden campaign initially directed us to news coverage of a January 2019 Kaiser Family Foundation tracking poll, which noted that the majority of Americans generally oppose Medicare for All if they hear arguments that frame the program as requiring Americans to pay more taxes or leading to delays in testing and treatment. (Kaiser Health News is an editorially independent program of the foundation.) On the flip side, though, when -- in the same poll -- Medicare for All was described as guaranteeing health insurance as a right for all Americans, or that it would eliminate health insurance premiums and reduce out-of-pocket costs, the majority favored the national health plan. That poll, now nearly a year old, found that when simply asked, 56% said they did favor having a national health plan, sometimes called Medicare-for-all, where all Americans would get their insurance from a single government plan. Those percentages, though, reflected the views of all Americans, not just Democrats. The same poll broke down respondents answers by political party and showed that 81% of Democrats favored creating a national health plan. The KFF Health Tracking Poll, done monthly, indicates Democrats support for Medicare for All has weakened, but not entirely. Its most recent version, published in November, revealed large majorities of Democrats support a public option (88%) andMedicare for All (77%). KFF's January 2019 tracking poll has 85% of Democrats favoringa Medicare buy-in. The majority of Democrats do support Medicare for All, but Medicare for All is not as popular as public option or a Medicare buy-in, said Ashley Kirzinger, who is the associate director for public opinion and survey research at KFF. Other polls show similar results: support for Medicare for All among Democrats but stronger support for the incremental approaches Biden backs. A September NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll, for instance, found 67% of Democrats said they supported adopting Medicare for All. The public option fared better, with 75% of Democrats supporting the proposal. The data  does show majority support among Democratic voters (whether that reaches a vast majority depends upon your interpretation), but higher support for a public option,Jeff Horwitt, senior vice president with Hart Research Associates wrote in an email. Hart Research Associates conducted the NBC/WSJ poll. The Biden campaign also directed us to a September KFF Health Tracking Poll that showed that 55% of Democrats prefer a candidate who would build on the existing Affordable Care Act, while 40% of Democrats prefer a candidate who would replace the ACA with Medicare for All. And one more from the Biden campaign -- a CNN article citing a July CNN and SSRS poll that found almost half (48%) of all respondents who lean Democratic said the national program should not replace private insurance, while 31% said that it should. That same CNN/SSRS poll, though, had 85% of respondents who are Democrats or Democratic-leaning independents responding yes when asked if the government should provide a national health insurance program for all Americans, even if it would require higher taxes. The numbers from these various polls seem to communicate a range of opinions among Democrats about Medicare for All. Robert Blendon of the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health said he thinks Bidens statement rings true based on a poll he helped conduct, in partnership with the Commonwealth Fund and The New York Times. Rather than asking survey respondents if they favored Medicare for All, the survey asked them to choose among Medicare for All, improving the existing ACA or replacing the ACA with state health plans. For registered Democrats, the results were close between two of the proposals: 46% preferred Medicare for All and 45% preferred improving the existing ACA. Only 7% preferred replacing the ACA with state health plans. In this survey, Medicare for All was not preferred by a majority of Democrats. But Blendon noted that survey respondents often will say yes to a one-off question about whether they support something and that answer can change once they have to choose among options, such as in his organizations survey. The answer is that Democrats are divided on whether or not they want to build on the ACA or whether they want to do Medicare for All, he said. Congressional support and another context Horwitt also made the point that it wasnt clear in Bidens statement which group of people he was referencing. I recall hearing the statement in real-time, but in looking now at just the statement from Biden below, it is unclear to me if he is talking about elected Democrats or Democratic voters when he references the vast majority, Horwitt wrote via email. While the Biden campaign did direct us to public opinion polls, they also pointed out that the Senate and House Medicare for All bills are only sponsored by a fraction of the members of the respective Democratic caucuses that would be needed to secure passage. The Senate Medicare for All bill, introduced by Sen. Bernie Sanders, has 14 co-sponsors, while the Houses Medicare for All bill, introduced by Rep. Pramila Jayapal, has 118 co-sponsors. (There are currently 233 Democrats in the House and 45 Democrats plus two independents in the Senate.) Our ruling During the recent presidential primary debates, Biden said: The fact is that right now the vast majority of Democrats do not support Medicare for All. Based on a cursory review of polls, this statement appears off-base. After all, most polls find that when Democrats are simply asked if they support Medicare for All, they answer yes. However, when those same polls dig deeper into this support by asking about the favorability of other Democratic-favored health policies -- Medicare for All, the public option or expansions of the Affordable Care Act -- or if such a Medicare for All program should replace private insurance, this support becomes weaker. The polls do seem to suggest support among Democrats for the moderate reforms Biden backs. Still, the evidence is lacking to support Bidens claim that a vast majority of Democrats oppose Medicare for All."
4737,mostly-false,Marco Rubio,It has been over 80 years since a lame-duck president appointed a Supreme Court justice.,"The death of U.S. Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia was a key topic at the start of the Republican presidential debate in South Carolina Saturday night. Some of the candidates, including Sen. Marco Rubio, called on President Barack Obama to hold back on his replacement and leave the decision to the next president. I do not believe the president should appoint someone, said Rubio, a Florida senator. And it's not unprecedented. In fact, it has been over 80 years since a lame-duck president has appointed a Supreme Court justice. Lets see what history shows about lame-duck presidential picks to the Supreme Court. We emailed spokespersons for Rubio and did not hear back. Nominations Technically presidents dont appoint a justice to the Supreme Court. They nominate someone who is then confirmed by the U.S. Senate. Theres also the problem of whether Obama should be considered a lame duck or not. Some would say Obama isnt a lame duck until after Election Day in November when his successor is chosen. Others might say all second-term presidents are lame ducks because they know they wont serve again. The definition has evolved, said Larry J. Sabato, director of the Center for Politics at the University of Virginia. Decades ago, the lame-duck label was applied to a president after an election, but the term has changed over time to include any officeholder in his or her last term. Either way, election-year Supreme Court nominations are rare. Rubios statement prompted several comments on Twitter from those who noted a specific exception to his claim: the nomination of Justice Anthony Kennedy. The Senate confirmed Kennedy 97-0 on Feb. 4, 1988. That was about 28years ago -- not 80. Kennedy replaced Justice Lewis Powell, who retired, and was Reagans third nomination for the opening, after Robert Bork and Douglas Ginsburg. Powell announced his retirement in June 1987. Reagan, who was in his second term, nominated Kennedy in November 1987. Kennedy was confirmed in February 1988. In November 1988, Reagans vice president George H.W. Bush won the presidency. The nomination actually wasn't in the election year, although the confirmation vote was, said Harvard law professor Mark Tushnet. This came up minutes later in the debate, when U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas said, We have 80 years of precedent of not confirming Supreme Court justices in an election year. Debate moderator John Dickerson of CBS News corrected Cruz by noting that Kennedy was confirmed in 1988. Were not certain which nomination Rubio was referring to 80 years ago. One possibility is when President Herbert Hoover nominated Benjamin Nathan Cardozo to fill a vacancy in February 1932, and Cardozo was confirmed that same month. Hoover then went on to lose re-election later that year. But Hoover was not a lame duck; he was eligible for re-election even though he lost, said Russell Wheeler, an expert on the courts at the Brookings Institution and former deputy director of the Federal Judicial Center. As of 2010, the Senate has rejected 16 of 34 Supreme Court nominations because of opposition to the nominating president, according to a 2010 Congressional Research Service report. Seven of the rejected nominations were put forward by presidents in their final year in office after a new president had been elected but before the successor took over. But those were more than 80 years ago. Each of these lame duck nominations transpired under 19th century presidents when the post-election period lasted from early November until early March, the report states. Our ruling Rubio said, It has been over 80 years since a lame-duck president appointed a Supreme Court justice. The most recent contradiction of this claim would be Reagans nomination of Kennedy. Kennedy was nominated in November 1987 and confirmed during Reagans final year of office in February 1988. Reagans timeline doesnt exactly line up with what Obama faces; Reagan had more time between his nomination and the end of his presidency. But its hard for us to see how Obama can be considered a lame duck but not Reagan. Both were second-term presidents who knew they would not serve again but did not yet know who their successor would be."
3074,mostly-false,Rush Limbaugh,"One person, Kathleen Sebelius, was going to determine whether or not 10-year-old lung patient Sarah Murnaghan would live or die.","Many Americans were transfixed recently by the story of Sarah Murnaghan, a 10-year-old Pennsylvania girl with cystic fibrosis whose family won a court battle to improve her chances of getting a lung transplant. Under the existing transplant rule, Murnaghan was too young to qualify for a place on the waiting list for adult lungs. So the girls family asked Kathleen Sebelius, the secretary of health and human services, to waive the rule. On May 31, 2013, Sebelius did order a policy review of the age requirements, but that option could take months -- likely longer than the girl could afford to wait. Sebelius declined to waive the rule in a way that would quickly aid her. Sebelius explained her reasoning to a House committee, saying there are about 40 very seriously ill Pennsylvanians over the age of 12 also waiting for a lung transplant, and three other children in the Philadelphia (area) at the same acuity rate as Sarah waiting for a lung transplant. The decisions of the  transplant committee -- which is not bureaucrats; it's transplant surgeons and health care providers who design the protocol -- are based on their best medical judgment of the most appropriate way to decide allocation in an impossibly difficult situation. But Sebelius found herself overruled on June 5, 2013, when U.S. District Judge Michael Baylson ordered her to temporarily waive the rule, allowing Murnaghan to join the adult list. At the House committee hearing, two Republican lawmakers -- Reps. Tom Price of Georgia and Lou Barletta of Pennsylvania-- grilled Sebelius about her role in the Murnaghan case. Soon after, conservative commentators, including Sean Hannity and Rush Limbaugh, took up the 10-year-olds cause and used it to criticize the Obama administration. Sebelius had already been under attack from conservatives for her role in implementing President Barack Obamas health care law. In discussing the Murnaghan case, Limbaugh drew a parallel with Sarah Palin's famous death panels claim, which suggested that the government could determine who lives and dies. (We awarded it our 2009 Lie of the Year.) On his June 6 show, Limbaugh told listeners, Until the judge moved in, Kathleen Sebelius was the death panel. One person, Kathleen Sebelius, was going to determine whether or not (Murnaghan lived or died), and she said, Some people live. Some people die.  All the while, the regime is denying, of course, that there were death panels and that Obamacare was not going to be doing this, and everybody knew that it was. We wondered whether Limbaugh was correct when he said that Sebelius was the sole decision maker. Where Limbaugh has a point Limbaugh is correct that Sebelius did have the power to overrule the age requirements of the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network -- the entity that oversees transplants in the United States. According to the current organ-transplant rules, which were adopted under President Bill Clinton, the networks board of directors is responsible for developing policies for the equitable allocation of organs. However, the rules allow an appeals process to the HHS secretary. The secretary can either reject the complaint, direct the network to revise the policies or practices or take such other action as the secretary determines appropriate. Its worth noting that the HHS secretary has not traditionally taken a hands-on role overseeing day-to-day transplant policy. And historically, a decision to change the rules based on one or two patients cases would be unusual, said I. Glenn Cohen, co-director of the Petrie-Flom Center for Health Law Policy, Biotechnology, and Bioethics at Harvard Law School. Still, Tait Sye, an HHS spokesman, did not dispute that Sebelius had a role in the process. He said that Sebelius decision not to issue a waiver -- at least until told by the judge to do so -- stemmed from her belief that medical experts, not a government official, should take priority. The interest of patients on the transplant list will not be well served by having an individual reach in and unilaterally change an organ allocation policy, Sye said. Given the specifics of the Murnaghan case, we think its reasonable to say that Sebelius, in her role as a source of appeal for the transplantation network, had a role in determining the likelihood of the girl being placed on a transplant list. How Limbaugh ignored others involved in the decision The problem with Limbaughs claim is that he uses the term one person, boiling down what amounts to a life-or-death question to Sebelius alone. Thats not accurate. For starters, if Sebelius had given her blessing immediately to the transplant-list switch, it wouldnt have determined Murnaghans life or death. Switching Murnaghan to the adult list would likely improve her chance of survival, but whether she actually survives depends on the availability of organs, whether they match with Murnaghans blood type, who else ranks ahead of her on the list, how well her own health holds up while awaiting surgery, and how successful the transplant surgery is. More importantly, the system for deciding who gets organ transplants includes several layers of responsibility. The guidelines were put together in an exhaustive rulemaking process, with wide public input. On an ongoing basis, the medical experts on the networks board interpret and enforce these rules. Then, Sebelius serves as a court of appeal. Finally, a federal judge has the power to overrule her appeal, as one did in this case. So there are many people who collectively enforce and interpret the rules. The national organ-allocation network is developed around a consensus of medical expertise and is meant to apply to all transplant candidates ... not to apply uniquely to one individual, said Joel Newman, a spokesman for the United Network for Organ Sharing, which manages the organ-sharing network under contract to the Department of Health and Human Services. Newman added that the rules are designed to provide as many individuals as possible an equitable opportunity to receive a transplant. Several bioethicists we contacted said that despite the obvious sympathy people have for patients like Murnaghan, Sebelius had sound reasons to act as she did. I don't think it would be proper to change the rules for one person rather than alter the entirety of the criteria for who gets priority, Cohen said. Arthur Caplan, a New York University bioethicist, agreed. The system of rules is built on decisions by medical and transplant experts in the area, in this case lungs, he said. No one person can or should have all authority over rationing organs. Appeals to the government or the courts need to be weighed carefully, because by intervening, the authority and legitimacy of an evidence-based, neutral system is put into doubt, and that is not a good thing for society or those waiting for transplants. Jonathan Moreno, a professor of medical ethics and health policy at the University of Pennsylvania, noted that a switch in Murnaghans status is not risk-free. Her medical condition, size and other factors compromise her chances, and a failure here means two dead -- Sarah, and the patient who didn't get the organ, Moreno said. Our ruling Limbaugh said that one person, Kathleen Sebelius, was going to determine whether or not 10-year-old lung patient Sarah Murnaghan would live or die, essentially serving as a one-woman death panel. Its true that Sebelius played an appeals role in the transplant-policy process. However, she was not the only person or entity that did -- existing rules, medical experts and a federal judge also played a role in Murnaghans case. In addition, Sebelius didnt have the power to grant or revoke life; many factors, including the availability and suitability of organs, will ultimately determine her likelihood of survival. UPDATE: On June 12, 2013, Murnaghan underwent lung transplant surgery."
2091,mostly-false,David Cicilline,"Brendan Doherty wants to repeal Obamacare, increasing drug prices for seniors.","If you vow to repeal a law but then promise to preserve some of its key provisions, are you really promising to repeal the law?That's the question surrounding an advertisement in support of Democratic U.S. Rep. David Cicilline's attempt to hold his 1st District seat against a challenge by Republican Brendan Doherty.The 30-second television ad, produced by Cicillines campaign, shows video of Doherty praising GOP presidential candidate Mitt Romney and lists some ways in which the two agree on key issues. It is available on YouTube.One issue is the Affordable Health Care Act, the controversial legislation often referred to as Obamacare.Doherty and Romney both want to repeal Obamacare, increasing drug prices for seniors, the ad says.Romney has already made it clear he wants to repeal the law. In looking at the assertion, we will focus on Dohertys position.Doherty has said repeatedly that he wants to repeal Obamacare because it places too much of a burden on small businesses.One element of the law was crafted to save Medicare recipients a lot of money because it closes the so-called doughnut hole, the gap in prescription drug coverage that has forced elderly people with health problems to shell out thousands of dollars per year.If Obamacare were simply repealed, the hole would reopen and its effect would be as Cicilline describes it.But if Doherty were elected and a new federal law were passed that closed the doughnut hole, Doherty could then vote to repeal Obamacare without increasing drug prices for seniors.Doherty has repeatedly said he wants to keep the doughnut hole closed. He also has said that he wouldnt repeal Obamacare without preserving that popular feature, and others.In a July 2, 2012, appearance on The Helen Glover Show, Doherty said I would vote to repeal it. But I think we need to find better solutions even before we repeal it.A bit later, he specifically referred to continuing coverage for young adults and people with pre-existing conditions and protecting people in the doughnut hole as good points in the law. He said those are areas to have real health care reform.Separately, the Doherty campaign sent us a July 12, 2012, news release in which the candidate criticized House Republicans for voting to repeal Obamacare without offering any alternative proposal.And we put the question to him directly, asking Doherty if he would, if elected, cast any vote to repeal Obamacare if the government hadn't first passed a law closing the doughnut hole. He said, No.But he said the safeguards could be part of a repeal bill.I wouldn't vote for any repeal of Obamacare if we didn't have the doughnut hole closed, or protection for children up to 26 years old and coverage for preexisting conditions in that, he said.Cicilline spokesman Eric Hyers, asked about the ad and Doherty's support for some elements of Obamacare, said in an e-mail: Simply because [Doherty] says he wants to find a bipartisan solution or that he has started mentioning parts of the bill he likes, is irrelevant. As soon as the bill is repealed, the benefits are gone and closing the doughnut hole, (or allowing young people to stay on their parents' insurance or whatever else), would have to be re-fought. Saying, 'He thinks there should be a solution before repeal,' is nice, but it doesn't change the real world implications of voting for repeal.Our rulingDavid Cicilline, in a campaign ad, says Brendan Doherty wants to repeal Obamacare, increasing drug prices for seniors.Doherty does want to repeal Obamacare, and a repeal would do precisely that.But Doherty, at least as far back as July 2, has repeatedly said he would not vote for repeal until better solutions are found.Such subtlety is lost in the Cicilline ad.(Get updates from PolitiFact Rhode Island on Twitter: @politifactri.

6684,mostly-false,No on 56 campaign,Prop 56 cheats schools out of at least $600 million.," Opponents of Proposition 56, Californias proposed $2 per pack cigarette tax hike, are flooding radio airwaves with attacks on the measure. The initiative is one of many on the states November ballot. The No on 56 campaign is funded by tobacco companiesPhillip Morris and R.J. Reynolds. Its campaign says online and in radio ads that the measure cheats schools out of at least $600 million a year. The industry attacks are not surprising. And theyll likely continue as opponents of the measure have raised more than $35 million, while supporters have collected about $17 million. We wondered whether theres any truth to the claim that Prop 56 cheats schools out of all that money. Our research Nearly three decades ago, voters in California approved Proposition 98 requiring a minimum level of funding for public education. It requires the state to dedicate roughly 40 percent of new General Fund revenues to K-12 schools and community colleges. Prop 56 would generateup to $1.4 billion in tax revenue its first year. But instead of sending that revenue to the General Fund, Prop 56 would place it in a special fund to help pay for Medi-Cal, which provides health coverage for millions of low-income Californians. We asked the No on 56 campaign for evidence that the tobacco tax measure cheats schools. A spokeswoman pointed to language in the measure that exempts Prop 56 from the school funding guarantee. The campaign said this exemption is proof that the measure undermines the funding guarantee and cheats schools. But the experts we spoke with say theres nothing new about this proposal. Past tobacco taxes, in 1988 and 1998, also established special funds rather than sending money to the General Fund. One of the experts said the opponents claim is misleading. When I think of this claim that the schools are going to be cheated -- particularly that word cheated out of this money -- that suggests something thats wrong or illegal. And this is not the case, said Steve Boilard, executive director of Sacramento State Universitys Center for California Studies. Theres plenty of examples where new revenue is raised that is not subject to the Prop 98 funding guarantee. Boilard pointed to Proposition 63, a tax on wealthy Californians that funds mental health services.  Curran Kelleher / Flickr Others reject claim State Superintendent of Public Instruction Tom Torlakson rejected the claim that the new tax measure cheats schools. In a recent letter circulated by the Yes on 56 campaign, he wrote: Make no mistake, Proposition 56 will not divert a dime away from schools. Rather, it will raise revenues for school based tobacco prevention and intervention programs. A report by the Legislative Analysts Office estimates Prop 56 will add $20 million for those school based programs. The Sacramento Bees fact-checking team, PoliGRAPH,recently examined the same claim about Prop 56 cheating schools. It found that it isnt fair to say the measure 'cheats'schools out of $600 million a year. Nothing in the measure reduces school funding. If the measure passes, the budget for schools does not decrease. Our ruling The No on 56 campaign is running ads that say the proposedtobacco tax cheats schools out of at least $600 million a year. The measure includes an exemption from the states school fundingguarantee. A portion of its revenues, estimated at up to $1.4 billion, could otherwise have been directed toward school funding. But past tobacco taxes and a tax to fund mental health services have also legally avoided this guarantee. Those had exemptions allowing their revenues to fund health services. This doesn't mean, however, that money will be taken from schools or community colleges under Prop 56. The measure, in fact, sends about $20 million to schools for tobacco prevention programs. The claim that Prop 56 cheats schools goes too far. It might have been accurate to say the measure exempts most all revenue from going to schools. But the term chosen by No on 56 is misleading.

10993,mostly-false,Chris Christie,"Says any attempt to try to compare the Massachusetts health care law with the federal health care law is completely, intellectually dishonest. Governor Romney did not raise one tax in doing what he did.","Standing beside Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney, Gov. Chris Christie had three strong words to describe any comparisons between Romneys health care reform in Massachusetts and the national health care reform law:Completely, intellectually dishonest.A week after ruling out his own candidacy, Christie on Tuesday traveled to New Hampshire to endorse Romney, the former Massachusetts governor. During a press conference, the discussion turned to the two health care reform measures.Any attempt to try to compare what happened in Massachusetts and what the president has done to the United States of America with his plan is completely, intellectually dishonest, Christie said. Governor Romney did not raise one tax in doing what he did in trying to improve the health care system in Massachusetts.Heres what PolitiFact New Jersey found: Christie is right that Romneys plan did not raise taxes, but there are too many similarities between the two reforms to dismiss any comparisons as completely, intellectually dishonest.First, lets talk taxes.Enacted in March 2010, the federal law imposed taxes on drug manufacturers, health insurers, medical devices and indoor tanning services, among other tax increases. The Massachusetts law signed by Romney in 2006 did not enact taxes, but was primarily financed through federal dollars.Its a lot easier to not raise taxes if you have the federal government paying a large share of the tab when youre a state, said Alan Weil, the executive director of the National Academy for State Health Policy.Also, in 2008 -- after Romney left office -- Massachusetts raised the cigarette tax and imposed additional fees on private companies to help finance health-care costs.Michael Widmer, president of the Massachusetts Taxpayers Foundation, said though the tax increases werent part of the initial health care law, they did help fund it. So, he said, its not fair to say theres no taxes raised.Like the federal law, the Massachusetts law imposes a fine on individuals who do not purchase health insurance. Some experts argued that such a penalty is a tax.Its government collecting money that you owe through your taxes, said Michael Doonan, executive director of the Massachusetts Health Policy Forum. I would consider this a tax.But Ed Haislmaier, a senior research fellow in health policy studies at the conservative Heritage Foundation, said, In both the Massachusetts reform and Obamacare, the individual mandate is not a tax, but a penalty enforced through the tax system. Still, the national health care reform was based on the Massachusetts plan, and the two have much in common. The core elements of the Massachusetts law include the same essential design as the national health care reform, according to John McDonough, a professor of public health practice at the Harvard University School of Public Health.Regardless of the tax issue, to suggest then that there is no basis to compare the two sets of reforms is not valid, McDonough, who was involved in the passage and implementation of the Massachusetts law, said in an email.Here are a few examples of the similarities between the two reforms:Individual mandate: At the heart of both measures is the requirement that residents have health insurance, with exemptions for certain individuals. Otherwise, residents could face a tax penalty.Employer requirements: The Massachusetts law requires employers with at least 11 full-time workers to contribute toward health insurance coverage, or pay a penalty per employee. Under the federal law, if employers with at least 50 full-time employees dont provide coverage, they must pay a fee to cover the cost of tax credits used by their workers to purchase insurance.Medicaid expansion: Both measures expand Medicaid in different ways. The national health care reform expands Medicaid to all non-Medicare eligible individuals under 65 years old who meet certain income requirements. In Massachusetts, the states Medicaid program was expanded to cover children with family incomes up to 300 percent of the federal poverty level.Insurance exchanges: Both measures establish insurance exchanges where individuals and small businesses can purchase insurance.All of the basic elements are really, frankly quite similar, said Sarah Iselin, president of the Blue Cross Blue Shield of Massachusetts Foundation.Our rulingChristie dismissed comparisons between the federal health care law and the Massachusetts health insurance reform as completely, intellectually dishonest, saying the state plan did not raise one tax.The state reform did not include tax increases, but it includes several core elements similar to those in the national reform. To deny that those similarities exist would be dishonest. To comment on this ruling, go to NJ.com."
17027,mostly-false,Conservative Solutions PAC,Says Donald Trump bans disabled veterans from his high rise.,"A PAC supporting Marco Rubio says Donald Trump mistreats those less fortunate than him -- including disabled veterans. Trump bans disabled veterans from his high rise, states the ad by the Conservative Solutions PAC. The ad has aired in San Francisco and multiple markets in Florida, including Miami and Tampa. Did the New York billionaire give the boot to disabled veterans from his high rise? No, he didnt do that. Instead, he wanted to ban disabled veterans who were given special licenses to peddle from selling their wares in front of his high rise. It is simply not true and a misrepresentation of the facts in every way, Trump spokeswoman Hope Hicks told PolitiFact Florida. A few days after the ad started running on TV, the PAC changed the wording of the line about veterans. We are putting the ads original claim on the Truth-O-Meter, but we will explain how and why the PAC tweaked the wording. Trumps Fifth Avenue high rise Trump wanted to get rid of street vendors around the Trump Tower, a 68-story condo and retail building on Fifth Avenue. The ad shows a Jan. 28, 2016, headline from the Daily Beast: Donald Trump wanted vets kicked off Fifth Avenue. (A spokesman for the PAC referred PolitiFact to the Daily Beast article and the New York Daily News article cited within it.) Peddling exemptions for disabled veterans have a long history in New York. First approved by the state in 1894, the exemption allowed disabled veterans to peddle on any commercial street or park throughout the state. In 1991, the state Legislature took up a bill to amend the law. Most peddling was prohibited on Fifth Avenue -- but 176 disabled veterans still had permission to peddle there. Trump wrote a letter to John Dearie, then-chairman of the state Assemblys Committee on Cities, according to the New York Daily News: While disabled veterans should be given every opportunity to earn a living, is it fair to do so to the detriment of the city as a whole or its tax-paying citizens and businesses? Trump wrote. Do we allow Fifth Avenue, one of the worlds finest and most luxurious shopping districts, to be turned into an outdoor flea market, clogging and seriously downgrading the area? In July 1991, New York City Mayor David Dinkins announced that an agreement had been reached with the Fifth Avenue Association, which represented hundreds of businesses. The businesses would offer disabled veterans jobs at twice the minimum wage, and the association would set up a fund to pay for job training, education or to move vendors to other parts of the city. The next month, then-Gov. Mario Cuomo signed a bill to repeal the peddling, but only for four years. In 1995, when the bill was up for renewal, the Legislature struck a compromise that banned peddling from Midtown Manhattan but included a plan to allow it in other zones to be defined later. Months later, some veterans continued to peddle in the banned area. In 2004, Trump complained about the vendors in a letter to then-Mayor Michael Bloomberg. Whether they are veterans or not, they (the vendors) should not be allowed to sell on this most important and prestigious shopping street, Trump wrote, according to the New York Post. Trump wrote that business owners had to repeatedly clean up debris left as a result of the vendors. Frankly, I have no idea how they can be doing business with the mess they have outside their front door, he wrote. Fifth Avenues comeback is going to be a short one if this situation is not corrected immediately. In response to his letter, a small group of protesters waved signs in front of Trump Tower that read, Vendors to Trump: You're Fired! and Why can't vets vend on streets we die to protect? We told the PACs spokesman that the ad could cause viewers to wrongly assume that Trump wanted to ban disabled veterans from living in his high rise. Ad didnt mention living, Jeff Sadosky replied. PAC changes ad After we started our fact-check, the PAC changed the wording of the ad. The original ad started Feb. 26, according to the Political TV Ad Archive, a website that tracks campaign ads and partnered with PolitiFact and other fact-checkers. On Feb. 29, Factcheck.org wrote that the ad was miseading and left out crucial details. By that date, the ad had aired at least 135 times in the Miami, Tampa and Orlando markets. PolitiFact first contacted the PAC about the ad on Feb. 29 and then later noticed on TV that the script had changed. The original ad said that Trump bans disabled veterans from his high rise. But the new version said that Trump bans veterans from in front of his high rise. Sadosky said the PAC changed the ad on March 1 to be more specific. Our ruling A pro-Rubio Super PAC said Trump bans disabled veterans from his high rise. The TV ad is misleading because viewers could assume that Trump tried to ban disabled veterans from living in his high rise. His beef was with street vendors including disabled veterans who were given special vendor licenses selling wares around his Trump Tower.Nothing in the ad makes it clear that this related to vendors selling on the street."
804,mostly-false,Texas Federation of Republican Women,Says that 9 million to 50 million undocumented immigrants live in the United States.,"A Texas group urging congressional action on immigration also says the number of illegal U.S. residents might vary more than five-fold.The Texas Federation of Republican Women, which describes itself as the states most powerful womens political group, said in its Jan. 17, 2013, resolution: Within the United States, there currently reside between nine (9) and fifty (50) million undocumented residents from all cultural and socio-economic backgrounds and nationalities.Thats some range. The 9 million figure undershoots a widely bandied estimate of 11 million, most recently included in December 2012 news accounts from USA Today and the Associated Press. The 50 million figure seems off the charts.And the full statement indicates that 3 percent to 16 percent of more than 315 million U.S. residents are here illegally.To our inquiries, a federation spokeswoman, Laura Sorrell of Austin, said the group drew its figures from different sources. She said by email that the group had no source to provide for the 9 million figure, while the 50 million figure was provided by a former fellow with Rice Universitys James A. Baker Institute for Public Policy, Joan Neuhaus Schaan. The 50 million methodologyBy phone, Schaan told us she reached her estimate, which she said she has not laid out in a research presentation, by assuming that annual apprehensions of border crossers represent about 10 percent of actual crossers, an assumption she said she based on years of speaking engagements, including many in the Texas-Mexico border region.Border region landowners, local law enforcement, those living the reality of human migration, would say that maybe 3 percent of those people that crossed were being apprehended, Schaan said. In some cases, thousands of people a week are crossing properties with virtually no apprehensions.Schaan was referring to apprehensions by the Border Patrol, part of the Department of Homeland Security, which reported in July 2011 that the number of apprehensions declined 61 percent from nearly 1.2 million in 2005 to 463,000 in 2010, with the vast majority of them occurring along the southwest border near Mexico. The 2010 total was the lowest level since 1972; peaks in apprehensions, of early 1.7 million, were reached in 1986 and 2000, it says.Yet the report cautions against presuming that apprehensions relate to a particular number of individuals. Apprehension data... represent events, not individuals, it says. The total number of apprehensions during a specific period will be greater than the total number of unique individuals apprehended because some individuals will have been apprehended more than once. The relationship between the number of border apprehensions to either the number of attempted illegal entries or the number of successful illegal entries is unknown.Other estimatesTo take our own look, we turned to several oft-quoted sources, each one lately suggesting there are 11 million to 13 million illegal U.S. residents.According to a March 2012 Department of Homeland Security report, there were 11.5 million illegal immigrants living in the country in January 2011, about the same number as in 2010, and a little more than half of the 22 million legal foreign-born residents in the country.Some history: The United States was home to up to 4 million illegal residents in 1980, the report says, with the number peaking at 11.8 million in 2007.The report, drawing from U.S. Census Bureau household surveys and Homeland Security figures, says some 55 percent of the unauthorized residents entered the country between 1995 and 2004, with entrants since 2005 accounting for 14 percent of the illegal 2011 residents.It is unlikely that the unauthorized immigrant population increased after 2007, the report says, given relatively high U.S. unemployment, improved economic conditions in Mexico, record low numbers of apprehensions of unauthorized immigrants at U.S. borders, and greater levels of border enforcement.The report says 59 percent of the countrys unauthorized immigrants in 2011, some 6.8 million, were from Mexico, with 2.8 million living in California, 1.8 million in Texas.More recently, the Pew Hispanic Center said in December 2012 that 11.1 million unauthorized residents lived in the country as of March 2011, unchanged from the previous two years and a continuation of the sharp decline in this population since its peak in 2007, the center said, when the number of illegal immigrants in the United States peaked at 12 million.Both Homeland Security and the Pew center devised their estimates by drawing on the census surveys and applying a residual method of calculation. Under this methodology, Pew wrote, a demographic estimate of the legal foreign-born population — naturalized citizens, legal permanent residents, temporary legal residents and refugees — is subtracted from the total foreign-born population. The remainder, or residual, is the source of population estimates and characteristics of unauthorized immigrants.The Center for Immigration Studies, which advocates for low levels of immigration, said it took a similar approach to conclude in an August 2012 report that there were 10.5 million illegal immigrants in the country in 2010, though it said that after adjustments of undercounting of the population by the U.S, Census Bureau the total could have been 11.5 million or more.Most research indicates that roughly 10 percent of illegals are not counted in Census Bureau surveys, the report says, meaning the true size of the illegal population could be 11.5 million. If the undercount is larger, then the total illegal alien population is larger.By email, the centers research director, Steve Camarota, said there could be 13 million illegal residents in the country. He said, though, that he doesnt see how administrative records such as births or school enrollments would justify any conclusion that such estimates are off by huge margins.There is uncertainty in the numbers, Camarota said. But not that big.We also touched base with the Federation for American Immigration Reform, which says its mission is to educate Americans about the costs of immigration, particularly illegal immigration. A spokesman, Jack Martin, said by phone that the group has taken up the estimates by Homeland Security, the Pew Hispanic Center and the Center for Immigration Studies and made adjustments for what it believes to be some untallied residents. He said FAIR believes there are 11.9 million illegal residents.Weaknesses in 50 million figureWe asked Martin for his thoughts on the topmost figure in the Texas groups resolution, 50 million.He said there is no logical basis for such an elevated estimate, though similar errors were made in the past when observers incorrectly counted each government apprehension of an illegal immigrant as an immigrant — even if the same person was apprehended by authorities a dozen times in a matter of weeks or over a year. Worse, he said, some observers erred by adding each years apprehensions to the tally for each subsequent year, inaccurately describing the ballooning total as a count of illegal immigrants in the country at that time.Similarly, Jeffrey Passel, senior demographer for the Pew Hispanic Center, said its a mistake to convert the number of Border Patrol apprehensions into a count of individuals living in the country.Aside from noting the same weakness identified by Martin, Passel said by phone that given that most apprehensions involve men, relating total apprehensions to the number of illegal residents in the country would erroneously signal that Mexico is overrun with women alone. Also not factored in, Passel said, is the fact that many illegal residents travel, staying in the U.S. for a few months at a time or less.Schaans methodology has no validity, Passel said.Finally, Martin also sounded a general cautionary note about pinning down the number of illegal residents. Any estimate is simply an estimate, he said.Schaan stuck by her figure, emailing: Clearly we have a difference of opinion on the approximate number, and any research group will be compelled to support their own positions and downplay anything different. There is no question in my mind the 11 million to 13 million figure is low, but there is no way to prove it one way or the other.Sorrell, of the federation, told us by email that the point of its resolution was to not get bogged down with the numbers, but to prove a point that no one knows what the actual numbers are.Our rulingThe federation said there are 9 million to 50 million illegal U.S. residents.At a glance, thats almost certainly right, though one could similarly say there are zero to 100 million. Too vast a range is misleading.Its also fair to concede that no one knows the precise number of illegal residents. However, accepted estimates, tied to household surveys and other research, suggest that the likely range tops out at 12 million or so, only one quarter of the federations unsupported top-end 50 million figure."
20979,mostly-false,Martin O'Malley,"If we pass immigration reform, it will make wages go up on average $250 for the average household.","While presidential candidate and former Maryland Gov. Martin OMalley was in Austin on a campaign stop, he said immigration reform would pay off for all Americans through their paychecks. In a Nov. 12, 2015 interview on Overheard with Evan Smith, OMalley discussed President Barack Obamas executive order on immigration, and whether he would take similar action. OMalley told Smith he believes the country needs immigration reform because its something important for the economy of the United States. If we pass immigration reform, it will make wages go up on average $250 for the average household, he elaborated. Why? Because youre getting 11 million people in many times off-the-books jobs onto the open economy of the United States of America. The number of undocumented immigrants in the United States has hovered around 11 million since 2009, according to a July 2015 report from the Pew Research Center, evaluating data through 2014. Undocumented immigrants make up 5.1 percent of the U.S. labor force, Pew reported in July 2015. We dont and cant check predictions. Still, we wondered whether it was true, based on research, that immigration reform could mean $250 more for the average American household, as OMalley said. Long-term figure OMalleys campaign press secretary, Haley Morris, said the governor got the $250 figure from a July 2013 White House report, published in support of a 2013 Senate immigration reform bill. That report, The Economic Benefits of Fixing Our Broken Immigration System, states that in the long run, the Senate bill raises wages for all groups of workers by boosting productivity. The White Houses conclusion relies on the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Offices analysis of the economic impact of that bill, the Border Security, Economic Opportunity, and Immigration Modernization Act.  The $250 figure OMalley cites is certainly long term. It refers to a rise in wages between 2013 and 2033 – and doesnt otherwise estimate year-by-year changes. As the White House report breaks it down: CBO estimates that real wages will be 0.5 percent higher in 2033 than projected under current law. In todays terms, that would be equivalent to an additional $250 of income for the median American household. Wages would increase partly because immigration reform would lead to a higher rate of return on capital throughout the next two decades. A web search led us to George Borjas, a labor economist specializing in immigration issues at Harvards John F. Kennedy School of Government. He questioned the assumptions behind the CBOs calculation. To reach its conclusion about immigration reforms effect on wages, the CBO report uses a positivity effect, a name for the effect of a correlation between state GDP and immigration. However, Borjas says, the relationship between higher state GDP and immigration could be correlation, not causation, which would put the $250 figure into question. Borjas, who reviewed the report at our request, said: Maybe immigrants are smart enough to realize they should settle in states with high productivity. Other research released when the bill in question was in the Senate in 2013 supported the CBOs analysis. An August 2013 article from the Brookings Institution compared the bills potential effects to immigrations historical impact on the economy, finding that on average, previous waves of immigrants tended to boost American wages. On the other hand, neither analysis said American households would see an immediate or steady spike in income. Lower wages in the short term Even if the long-term $250 figure holds true, the CBO concluded that comprehensive immigration reform actually would lead to lower average wages in the short-term before boosting overall productivity. In the first decade, according to its analysis, average wages would decrease by 0.1 percent. By the CBO's estimates, average wages would be slightly lower than under current law through 2024 before they rise above current wages the following decade. Comprehensive immigration reform also would lead to a temporary imbalance in the labor market, causing slightly higher unemployment through 2020, when the labor market would adjust. Wages would be lower at first, the CBO says, because growth of the workforce would outpace capital available. In addition, new workers would be less skilled and have lower wages, affecting average wages for the entire workforce. Brookings pointed out that wage decreases would be larger for workers with some high school or only a high school diploma, who would be more likely to compete with new workers, compared to college graduates.  Other considerations Immigration reforms effects on the economy extend beyond immediate and long-term effects on average wages. As Gregory Wright, an assistant professor of economics at University of California-Merced who studies international trade and migration, points out, Immigrants are very entrepreneurial relative to the native population, and high-skill immigrants tend to generate a disproportionate number of patents and are more innovative by other measures. In another section of its report, the CBO specifies that immigrants receive patents at twice the rate of the native-born U.S. population. Additionally, Wright says, immigration reform would create work through demand-side channels. Moving undocumented workers into the open would allow them to raise their own standard of living and they would subsequently demand more housing, education and generally more of all goods and services, which generates work for others, Wright said. Increasing the sheer number of people in the workforce raises output and consumption, or GDP, Wright says. The CBO estimated that immigration reform would raise real GDP by 3.3 percent in 2023 and by 5.4 percent in 2033. Immigrants entering the official workforce will then pay taxes, supporting the aging U.S. population, Wright added. Our ruling OMalleys claim that immigration reform would make wages go up on average $250 for the average household would not be accurate anytime soon. The $250 in question is a calculation based on mathematical assumptions -- assumptions that some question -- that refers to a long-term result over two decades. In the near term, the same analysis projects wages would dip slightly. OMalleys statement contains an element of truth, but the wage-raising conclusion is misleading. MOSTLY FALSE– The statement contains some element of truth, but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.

20480,mostly-false,Hillary Clinton,I negotiated open borders to let fleeing refugees into safety from Kosovo.,"As a way of burnishing her credentials to be commander in chief, Sen. Hillary Clinton made a number of claims during an interview with CNN, including, I negotiated open borders to let fleeing refugees into safety from Kosovo. On May 14, 1999, first lady Clinton visited a refugee camp in Skopje, Macedonia, for ethnic Albanians leaving Kosovo. The trip received extensive press coverage focused on the plight of families trying to escape violence at the hands of Serbian forces. I want to send a message to the refugees that we do not intend to let the evil which (Yugoslavia President Slobodan) Milosevic perpetrated against these people keep them away from their homeland and their homes, Clinton said on the trip. Hillary Clinton's campaign has put forward statements from former Bill Clinton administration officials about the importance of the trip. Richard C. Holbrooke, who negotiated the 1995 Dayton Accords ending the war in Yugoslavia and is supporting Sen. Clinton's presidential bid, said the first lady pressed officials on her trip to keep borders open and then continued to lobby for refugees when she returned to Washington. After visiting refugees and gaining a first-hand assessment of the situation, the first lady had intense talks with President Gligorov and Prime Minister Georgievski, Holbrooke said in a written statement. In these talks, one in the Presidential Palace, another in the residence of the American Ambassador, Christopher Hill, Mrs. Clinton pressed the Macedonian government to fully open the border so that Kosovar Albanian refugees could flee the war zone to safety. The trip seemed more designed to gain media coverage than to conduct substantive diplomacy, however. Clinton visited the area for less than 12 hours, arriving at 9:20 a.m. and leaving at 5:45 p.m. According to the itinerary provided to news organizations, she arrived at the camp and was briefed on relief efforts at 10 a.m., toured the camp at 11 a.m., and met with nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) at 1:30 p.m. Her meetings with officials appear to have been brief. Holbrooke is correct on some of the details he mentions, but the meetings all took place within the space of a single afternoon. The itinerary shows photo opportunities for the traveling press at 2:20 p.m. with Prime Minister Branko Crvenkovski at the U.S. Ambassador's Residence; at 2:50 p.m. with President Kiro Gligorov at the president's residence; and at 3:30 p.m. with first lady Gligorov at the president's residence. TheNew York Timesreported that her visit to the camp was so carefully scripted that administration officials chose which refugees Mrs. Clinton would speak with. Macedonia opened its borders before Clinton visited, so it seems unlikely that she personally negotiated for border openings. But the Clinton administration wanted to make sure the borders stayed open amid concern that Macedonian officials were trying to keep refugees out. In this context, her trip suggests a diplomatic visit intended to reinforce U.S. goals in the region. In her biographyLiving History, she mentions her visit and describes it as supporting the administration's diplomatic agenda around the world, but she does not mention taking part in specific negotiations. We tried and failed to find an independent expert who could speak to her role in negotiating open borders. Janusz Bugajski, an expert on the region with the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, D.C., said via e-mail of her visit, No doubt she tried to help the plight of refugees, but whether she was mandated by President Clinton to speak on behalf of the U.S. administration concerning policy in the region one would need to ask the former president. Our reading of the record shows a good deal to suggest Clinton was concerned about the plight of the people of Kosovo, but almost nothing to indicate she was a major player in border negotiations. We'll give her the benefit of the doubt for traveling to Macedonia and meeting with officials, but the way her statement is phrased, it makes her sound primarily responsible for the United States' efforts in the region. We don't find evidence to support that aside from her less-than-12-hour visit, and so we find her statement to be Barely True. "
705,mostly-false,Donald Trump,Crimea was sort of taken away from President Obama.  And he wanted Russia to be out of what was called the G-8. And that was his determination.," President Donald Trump entered the G-7 summit in Biarritz, France, urging his fellow members to re-admit Russia to the group, from which it had been expelled in 2014. Other G-7 members gave the idea a cool reception. During a post-summit question-and-answer session with journalists, Trump was asked about it. Yamiche Alcindor of PBS asked Trump, Why do you think its appropriate to invite Russia to the G-7, given that theyve meddled in the 2016 election? And are you worried that if Russia does come to the G-7, that it might hurt you politically, because its only going to be a couple months before the 2020 election? Trump said it was better to have Russia inside the room than outside, but he then turned his focus to his predecessor, President Barack Obama. A lot of bad things happened with President Putin and President Obama, Trump said. Trump cited Crimea, a peninsula located on the Black Sea. Following the ousting of Ukraines pro-Russia president Viktor Yanukovych, Russian forces invaded Crimea in 2014 and officially absorbed it into Russia. (Until 1954, Crimea had previously been part of Russia.). It was sort of taken away from President Obama, Trump said. Not taken away from President Trump; taken away from President Obama. President Obama was not happy that this happened because it was embarrassing to him. Right? It was very embarrassing to him. And he wanted Russia to be out of what was called the G-8. And that was his determination. He was outsmarted by Putin. He was outsmarted. President Putin outsmarted President Obama. Experts contacted by PolitiFact said Trumps statement is filled with misleading assertions. For starters, Russia did invade and, eventually, annex Crimea during Obamas presidency -- in February and March 2014. But Russia didnt take Crimea away from either Obama or the United States – it took the region away from Ukraine, of which it which it was an internationally recognized part. Trumps statement is a very odd way of thinking about Crimea and the United States role in Ukraine, said Susanne Wengle, a political scientist at the University of Notre Dame. It is highly misleading and factually incorrect. The U.S. exercised a certain influence among certain Kiev and Ukrainian politicians – how much and whom is disputed – but the U.S. never had Crimea. In addition, Trumps phrasing – sort of taken away – soft-pedals Russias coercive actions in seizing Crimea, said Anders Åslund, a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council. This is not what you call a military occupation, Åslund said. Its also worth noting that, despite Trumps focus on his predecessor, Obama wasnt alone in opposing Russias annexation. Virtually the entire global community refused to recognize the annexation, which was the first such takeover in Europe since the end of the Cold War. Europe, the United Nations and other U.S. allies opposed the invasion and annexation, said Yoshiko Herrera, a University of Wisconsin political scientist. It wasnt just Obama who opposed it. Trumps statement is problematic for other reasons. While the Obama administration did support Russias expulsion from the G-8 over the annexation of Crimea, it did not do so unilaterally, and in fact could not have acted unilaterally. The G-7 was united behind the decision to kick out Russia from G-8, so it was a common consensus decision, Åslund said. In a communique dated March 24, 2014, the leaders of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom, the United States, the European Council and the European Commission jointly wrote that they strongly condemn Russias actions in Crimea. The signatories agreed that they would not participate in a scheduled G-8 meeting in Sochi, Russia, and that they would suspend our participation in the G-8 until Russia changes course and the environment comes back to where the G-8 is able to have a meaningful discussion. To date, the G-8 has not invited Russia back into the fold. All in all, Trump seems to find it hard to believe that there could be any reason other than embarrassment to oppose aggression and territorial dismemberment of a major European state, said Steve Sestanovich, a senior fellow for Russian and Eurasian studies at the Council on Foreign Relations. Trump said that Crimea was sort of taken away from President Obama.  And he wanted Russia to be out of what was called the G-8. And that was his determination. Obama did oppose Russias annexation of Crimea and back its expulsion from the G-8, but Trumps view leaves out much of the story. Trumps remark ignores both widespread opposition to Russians actions within Europe and among U.S. allies, as well as the strongly worded decision by the remaining G-7 nations to expel Russia from the group. It also ignores that Crimea was taken away from Ukraine, not Obama."
8693,mostly-false,Chris Larson,Republicans offered Wisconsin bar patrons free shots (of alcohol) to sign recall petitions against Democrats.,"In the spring of Wisconsins discontent, voters launched recall campaigns against 16 state senators.Thats every state lawmaker who was eligible to be recalled -- and four times the number who have been forced into such elections in the 85 years that Wisconsin state officers could be recalled.The recalls followed the collective bargaining-curbing budget-repair bil introduced by Republican Gov. Scott Walker in February 2011. Formal recall campaigns targeted eight of the 14 Democratic senators who fled to Illinois for three weeks in an attempt to prevent a vote on Walkers bill; and eight GOP senators, all of whom voted for the bill, which became law but is tied up in court.So far, the campaigns against three Democrats failed to collect enough signatures; efforts targeting the other 13 lawmakers are pending.On April 22, 2011, first-term state Sen. Chris Larson, a Milwaukee Democrat, stirred the pot with an Internet comment about the still-active recall campaign against Kenosha Democrat Robert Wirch, a 19-year state lawmaker.In case you missed it, Larson tweeted, Republicans offered free shots to sign recall petitions against Dems.Thats shots, as in shots of alcohol, and Dems as in Democrats.Lets belly up to the bar and see if thats what happened.Larsons tweet linked to an article posted the same day on Alternet.org, a website that says it aims to inspire action and advocacy on the environment, human rights and civil liberties, social justice, media, health care issues, and more.Larson stated flatly that Republicans offered the free shots, but the article hedged, saying, Republicans apparently had to give out free shots of booze to people to get them to sign petitions to recall Democratic state senators.So, the article itself does not fully back up Larsons claim.The article refers readers to the previous nights edition of the liberal Rachel Maddow Show on MSNBC.Maddow told how earlier that day, the liberal HuffingtonPost.com posted audio of a conversation she said documented a claim by Democrats that circulators of petitions to recall Democratic state senators offered free shots of booze to get people to sign the petitions.The audio accompanied an article by Huffington Post reporter Amanda Turkel that said a Democratic source provided the audio, as well as a draft of a complaint that the Wisconsin Democratic Party might file with the state Government Accountability Board, which oversees elections.The draft of the complaint, according to the article, was signed by a woman who was with friends on Feb. 27, 2011, at Johns Main Event in Burlington, a small city in southeastern Wisconsin. The article said the woman heard that someone in the restaurant was offering free shots to people who signed a recall petition against Wirch.The woman, the article continued, said a bartender showed her the recall petition and told her that if she signed it, she and her friends would get free shots.Heres some of whats in the roughly one minute of audio:A woman says, OK, so youre going to get us one, two, three, four, five shots if we sign this.A man replies, Thats right. Ill buy them.Theres a bit of chatting among a group of women about the recall petition, then the woman who spoke to the man says to her friends, amid some other chatter:Because its bull-crap, what he did. Because its bull-crap that they went out of the state, she said, apparently referring to Wirch and the other Democratic senators who fled to Illinois. Thats bull-crap. No, to recall him, to get him out of there for the bull-crap that he did.So, an article and an audio recording indicate someone of unknown party affiliation offered to buy shots of alcohol for a group of women, and perhaps other bar patrons, if they signed a recall petition against one Democrat. Asked if Larson had evidence beyond the article he linked to in his tweet, his staff cited the Huffington Post report along with a Wisconsin Radio Network report. The radio report, however, simply mentioned the allegation.When we talked to Larson, he acknowledged he had no evidence beyond media reports; said he was aware of only the one instance in which shots allegedly were offered; and said he assumed the offer he tweeted about would have been made by a Republican, given that Wirch is a Democrat.We also called Dan Hunt, chairman of Taxpayers to Recall Robert Wirch, who provided this account: Hunt added that the Wirch recall campaign does not condone offering alcohol in exchange for signing petitions, but he noted that the Government Accountability Board has said such a practice is not illegal.Board spokesman Reid Magney confirmed that offering a shot for a signature is not illegal. But he said, We strongly discourage anyone from offering anything of value in exchange for a signature on a petition because it taints the process. Hunt refused to give us the name of the bartender, saying the bartender didnt want to be interviewed. Hunt said he did pass along our interview request to the bartender. But the man didnt respond to that, or to a phone message we left with an employee at Johns Main Event.Wirch didnt call us back, either, and a spokesman for the state Democratic Party declined comment.OK, someone get us the tab.Larson claimed that Republicans offered free shots of alcohol to get people to sign recall petitions against Democrats, framing it in the broadest possible sense.Larson is correct that multiple free shots were offered. But the record so far shows they were offered by one person, whose party affiliation, if any, isnt known. And the shots were offered for signatures against only one Democrat.Larsons statement contains some element of truth, but wrongly suggests that the shots-for-signatures was more than an isolated incident."
19872,mostly-false,National Republican Senatorial Committee,Michael Bennet cast the deciding vote for the stimulus and the health care bill.,"If you're seeking to tie your opponent to two controversial bills, what better way to do it than to say he cast the deciding vote to pass them? That's exactly what the National Republican Senatorial Committee is doing in the Colorado Senate race between incumbent Democrat Michael Bennet and GOP nominee Ken Buck.On Oct. 6, 2010, the Senate Republicans' campaign arm ran an ad attacking Bennet's role in helping pass two Democratic-sponsored bills, the economic stimulus and the health care overhaul.One vote makes a difference, the narrator says. Michael Bennet cast the deciding vote for Obama's stimulus that wasted billions, added to the debt and didn't create the jobs they promised. Bennet cast the deciding vote to allow passage of the trillion-dollar health care bill that slashed Medicare, hurting seniors. Bennet's vote was the key to billions in job-killing taxes, too. Michael Bennet: He's been their vote, not Colorado's.We won't tackle the ad's description of the substance of the two bills. (We've addressed some of those points in the past.) Instead, we'll look at whether it's fair to call Bennet the deciding vote on those bills.First, some background on how the bills passed. Both measures had long and roundabout legislative paths to President Barack Obama's desk, but we'll stick to the two votes the ad specifically references on screen.The stimulus vote cited in the ad was taken Feb. 13, 2009. It was to approve the conference report of the bill -- that is, the version that both chambers must pass with identical language. Once both chambers pass identical versions, the bill goes to the president to be signed. For the stimulus, the final vote was 60-38, with exactly the number of votes needed to meet the three-fifths supermajority required of most major actions in the Senate.Meanwhile, the health care vote mentioned in the ad was taken Dec. 23, 2009. The vote was to invoke cloture -- that is, to cut off debate so that consideration of the bill could proceed. Invoking cloture requires 60 votes, and in this case the Democrats once again got exactly the 60 votes required.The idea that the Democrats couldn't spare even a single vote is the crux of the NRSC's argument.Absolutely Michael Bennet was the deciding vote, NRSC spokesman Brian Walsh told PolitiFact. Had he not done so, they wouldnt have passed the health care bill, regardless of whether he was first, middle or last to cast his vote. End of story.But is it? What about the argument that Bennet was merely one of 60 deciding votes. Couldn't the same charge be leveled at every member of the Senate who voted as Bennet did?We ran the issue by a variety of congressional scholars, and most agreed that it was a stretch for the NRSC to label Bennet's vote the deciding vote.That statement is misleading and a distortion of fact, said James Thurber, a political scientist at American University.Several experts we spoke to pointed to historical examples in which lawmakers waited until the last moment to help push the bill over the top.Norman Ornstein, a resident fellow at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, pointed to President Bill Clinton's attempt to pass the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 -- a bill that critics loathe for raising taxes but which supporters praise for eventually producing surpluses in the latter part of the decade. Lacking any Republican support in Congress, the measure faced nail-biter votes in both chambers, with then-Rep. Marjorie Margolies-Mezvinsky, D-Pa., and Sen. Bob Kerrey, D-Neb., attracting wide attention for remaining undecided until shortly before the votes and then ultimately voting yes. In Margolies-Mezvinsky's case, her loss the following year was universally blamed on that vote.Then there was the 1985 vote on President Ronald Reagan's budget by then-Sen. Pete Wilson, R-Calif. Wilson was wheeled onto the Senate floor wearing blue pajamas following surgery for a ruptured appendix. That could be called a deciding vote, said Stephen Hess, a Brookings Institution senior fellow emeritus.Indeed, there's a long and storied history of senators holding back on supporting a bill until certain demands are met, said Donald Ritchie, the historian of the Senate. This approach takes some nerve, because the undecided vote may come under fire from both sides, but the rewards can sometimes be significant, Ritchie said.So, did Bennet's approval of the stimulus and the health care bill follow the same pattern? The short answer is no.On the stimulus, Bennet spoke favorably of the bill at least as early as Jan. 31, 2009 -- two weeks before he cast the vote cited in the ad -- when the Rocky Mountain News paraphrased him saying he likes the overall direction of the legislation. He was part of a bipartisan group of 20 Senators trying to shrink the size of the stimulus, which suggests that he was sufficiently supportive of the bill that he was willing to work behind closed doors to see it succeed. His approach does not seem like that of a reluctant holdout.On health care, Bennet actually took to the Senate floor to forcefully criticize deals struck by party leaders on behalf of holdout Democratic Senators, hoping to persuade them to vote for the health care bill. Columnists opposed to reform have criticized me for saying that I am willing to lose my seat to enact meaningful health care reform, he said on Dec. 21, 2010, two days before the vote. Now, I am being asked why I didn't negotiate a special deal with leadership. In fact, there was a report this morning criticizing me because the National Republican Senatorial Committee was rejoicing that I did not ask for special favors. Only in Washington would someone be attacked for not negotiating a backroom deal. Just because others choose to engage in the same tired Washington rituals, doesn't mean that I have to. Bennet continued, So I have a message for the columnists, the political professionals, and those back home. I am not happy about the backroom deals. I am not happy that the public option was held hostage by people in our own party. I do not support rewarding delay with special deals. I will let others justify their vote and their tactics. Indeed, as the health care debate came to a climax in the Senate, a stronger case can be made that any of several other senators deserve the title of the deciding vote. In a Dec. 24, 2009, account tracing the health bill's Senate endgame, Noam N. Levey and Janet Hook of the Los Angeles Times cited Sen. Joe Lieberman, I-Conn., as a late holdout, due to his opposition to a proposal for a Medicare buy-in. That policy would have allowed certain non-senior citizens to voluntarily join the federal health care plan for the elderly.According to the article, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., knew that he had to keep Lieberman in the tent. And the next night, when Democrats gathered for a special caucus meeting, Reid did not call out the Connecticut senator, focusing instead on the need to unite and move forward. Without the Medicare buy-in, Lieberman would be the 59th vote. At the meeting, Reid turned to Sen. Ben Nelson, D-Neb., who had a long list of demands, including more restrictions on funding abortions and full federal funding to expand Nebraska's Medicaid program. ... Reid was closing in on a deal.Suddenly, another roadblock appeared: Republican opponents of the bill threatened to filibuster -- that is, indefinitely block consideration of -- an unrelated defense appropriations bill as a way of indirectly delaying the health care measure. To get around that, Reid had to convince Sen. Russ Feingold, D-Wis. -- an opponent of the defense bill for substantive reasons -- not to join the Republican blockade.Reid was unwilling to challenge Feingold on a vote of conscience,the Los Angeles Times article reported. And when Democrats gathered for yet another special caucus meeting ... Reid was ready to concede defeat. But as dejected senators began to leave, Feingold arose: He would put aside his convictions on the war, he said, and vote with his party. 'I don't think there was a dry eye in the caucus room,' said Sen. Benjamin L. Cardin, D-Md.And there was at least one more potential deciding vote -- the late Sen. Robert Byrd, D-W.Va. It wasn't a question of whether Byrd would support the bill but rather a question of whether he'd be physically able to reach the chamber to vote.Byrd had spent six weeks in the hospital earlier in 2009 with a staph infection. On the day of the vote, Byrd was pushed onto the Senate floor in his plaid wheelchair, bundled in a coat, scarf and hat, according to an account in the New York Times.Lieberman, Nelson, Feingold, Byrd -- any of them could easily have been described as the deciding vote on the health care bill. So could any of the other 56 senators voting in favor. The NRSC ad is true, but not very informative, since there were 60 deciding votes, concludes David W. Rohde, a Duke University political scientist.The NRSC ad would have been quite justified in describing Bennet's vote for either bill as crucial or necessary to passage of either bill, or even as a deciding vote. But we can't find any rationale for singling Bennet out as the deciding vote in either case. He made his support for the stimulus bill known early on and was not a holdout on either bill. To ignore that and the fact that other senators played a key role in completing the needed vote total for the health care bill, leaves out critical facts that would give a different impression from message conveyed by the ad."
8120,mostly-false,Dennis Kucinich,"Says the Defense Department shrink-wrapped $10.8 billion in American money, loaded it on 175 pallets and put it on a transport plane to Iraq where they passed out $100 bills and no one has any receipts.","Cleveland Democratic Rep. Dennis Kucinich blasts the Iraq war every chance he gets. With Republicans promising budget cuts now that theyve taken control of the U.S. House of Representatives, its not surprising whats at the top of Kucinichs list of potential trims.To meet your stated purpose of protecting American taxpayers from waste, fraud and abuse, it is essential that you examine the Department of Defense and money wasted during unnecessary wars, Kucinich said in a Jan. 4 letter to Oversight and Government Reform Committee Chairman Darrell Issa, a California Republican.Kucinich has also taken to television to make his case for Defense Department cuts. He alleged outrageous abuses during a Jan. 6 interview with Fox News anchor Jon Scott.Listen, when you can have a Defense Department that can shrink wrap $10.8 billion in American money, load it on 175 pallets and put it on a, on a transport plane and ship it to Iraq where they pass out $100 bills and no one has any receipts, when you know that kind of waste is going on, . . . we have concerns in this country that we have to start taking care of, and it's important that we track the misspending that's going on through the Department of Defense so that we can keep that money for the things we need at home, Kucinich said.We thought it would be worth investigating Kucinichs claim that the Pentagon loaded billions of shrink-wrapped U.S. dollars onto transport planes and flew them to Iraq, where these $100 bills were dispensed out without receipts.Kucinich spokesman Nathan White said his boss claim stemmed from a February 2007 House Oversight Committee hearing conducted by the committees then-chairman, Henry Waxman of California, which examined massive shipments of U.S. currency to Iraq as part of the war effort.A transcript of that hearing indicates the money at issue consisted of nearly $12 billion in cash that the Federal Reserve (not the Defense Department) sent to Iraq on C-130 cargo planes, mainly in shrink-wrapped packages of $100 bills, between May 2003 and June 2004. The money wasnt U.S. tax dollars – it came from Iraqi oil sales that were put in a development fund for the Iraqi people. It was sent in cash because no banks or financial system existed in Iraq immediately after the U.S. occupation. Some of the money was used to stabilize the country by launching large public works programs to create jobs. Much of it was given to Iraqi ministries to pay the salaries and pensions of Iraqi civil servants who hadnt had a paycheck since before the war. Although the Iraqi ministries lacked good payroll records, former Coalition Provisional Authority Administrator Paul Bremer told the committee that delaying their payments until better records were available would have been demoralizing and unfair to millions of Iraqi families, and might well have exacerbated danger to the American soldiers on the ground.Under Saddam Hussein, the Iraqi government had been by far the countrys largest employer, providing about four out of five of all jobs, Bremer testified. But for several months, since before the war, millions of Iraqi families had not received money owed them for civil service, salaries or pensions.Special Inspector for Iraq Reconstruction Stuart Bowen, who was charged with auditing money sent to Iraq for reconstruction, told the committee that more should have been done to track how the money was spent. His auditors said nearly $9 billion was improperly accounted for. In a recent interview, he stressed that his findings didnt mean all that money was used improperly, although his office found cases of graft that totaled in the tens of millions of dollars. He said 44 people have been convicted of crimes uncovered by his office.There were weak controls that made the money susceptible to waste and abuse, said Bowen. The money was given to these interim Iraqi ministries who spent it and used it as they chose. The fact that it was Iraqi money didnt in any way diminish our duty to make sure we carried out our fiduciary responsibilities. It was not well managed and not well accounted for.Bowens office released an audit last year that found inadequate accounting for $8.7 billion of another $9.1 billion in subsequent shipments of Iraqi cash that the Defense Department sent to Iraq after January 2004. It found several cases of bribery, fraud and money laundering by U.S. officials that resulted in eight criminal convictions and $7.8 million in fines, forfeitures and restitution payments, the report said.Kucinichs spokesman did not respond to questions asking why Kucinich told Fox that $10.8 billion was at issue, when $12 billion was the amount discussed by Waxmans committee. Bowen said he wasnt familiar with any cases where $10.8 billion were shipped to Iraq on 175 pallets, as Kucinich claimed, though he applauded Kucinichs advocacy for effective Iraq oversight.He is one of the reasons why the Special Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction has been able to succeed in the last seven years of work, Bowen said of Kucinich. Pentagon spending may be a legitimate place to look for budget cuts, but money misspent from this source could not be used for the things we need at home."
15653,mostly-false,Facebook posts,A collection of photos shows animals caught in the Australia wildfires.,"Destructive bushfires in Australia have torched millions of acres across the region and have killed over 20 people and an estimated 480 million animals. We recently came across a Facebook page that posted a collection of heartbreaking images that purports to show scenes of different animals caught in the fires. Theres just one problem: Many of the images are not from the wildfires in Australia. Some are not even from a fire event. We fact-checked several of the photos in the post, including this viral photo of a tiger on fire that was taken in 2012 in Jakarta, Indonesia. It depicted a bonfire of taxidermy animals. The multi-photo post that included that image has been shared over 84,000 times since Jan. 4 and displays 29 photos showing animals surrounded by smoke or fire, with the caption, Huge wildfire in Australia has resulted in deaths of more than 480 milion animals. Hundred of rare koalas are also reported dead among them. Lets pray for Australia Source: University of sydney report #wildfire. The University of Sydney estimated on Jan. 3 that 480 million animals have been killed in the New South Wales bushfires since September 2019. The post containing this photo gallery was flagged as part of Facebooks efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) We were able to track down several of the photos using the reverse-image search tool, Tin Eye. Here are some that are included in the post with their original locations and dates. (Note to readers that many of these images are disturbing.) An image of a horse being pulled through a smoky field was taken by photographer Étienne Laurent on Oct. 30, 2019, in Simi Valley, California. Horses were being pulled by ranchers to evacuate a burning ranch as the Easy Fire spread. A photo of a deer standing near a burned residence shows the aftermath of the Camp Fire that tore through Paradise, California. The photo was taken on Nov. 10, 2018, by photographer Josh Edelson. (Another image of a deer in the post wasnt taken during a fire event and was found on Adobe Stock Images, titled Red Deer in morning Sun.) An image of a burned cat was also taken in Paradise, California, showing destruction from the Camp Fire. Photojournalist Jane Tyska took the photograph on Nov. 11, 2018. A photo of a group of burned sheep lying dead in a field was taken in Australia, but it was taken in January 2013 in a New South Wales field after bushfires swept through the area. We found that a few of the other photos were taken in Australia more recently, in September 2019, but several more date back multiple years. Though this viral post contains a smattering of images that are legitimately connected to the current wildfires devastating Australia, it appears an overwhelming number of those depicted here are not."
20364,mostly-false,Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee,"In slashing $1.7 billion from Social Security, Rep. Jim Renacci may end up forcing the entire agency to ... shut down for a month, causing seniors to not get their benefits on time, halting claims processing, and forcing new retirees and disabled workers into a backlog.","The GOP spending plan that passed the House of Representatives on Feb. 19 wont become law because Democrats who control the U.S. Senate and hold the White House wont let it become law.But that wont stop Democrats from using its hypothetical cuts as campaign points.House Republicans say the cuts they approved show theyre serious about tightening the governments belt and cracking down on pork-barrel spending. Democratic critics say its provisions would destroy thousands of jobs and undermine everything from education to food safety.Since passage of the spending package, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee has dispatched a steady drumbeat of news releases targeting GOP supporters on aspects they believe will be politically unpopular. A Feb. 22 missive titled Representative Jim Renacci and House Republicans Vote to Cut Social Security and Delay Benefits made the following claim:In slashing $1.7 billion from the Social Security Administration, Rep. Jim Renacci may end up forcing the entire agency to have to shut down for a month, causing seniors to not get their benefits on time, halting claims processing, and forcing new retirees and disabled workers into a backlog before seeing their benefits.It sounded like a draconian enough accusation for PolitiFact Ohio to check out.The news release attributes its projections to Democrats on the House Ways and Means Committee, who estimated the cuts would force month-long furloughs at SSA, and an assessment by National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare CEO Barbara Kennelly, formerly a Democratic member of the House of Representatives from Connecticut.Kennelly said that further cuts in Social Security funding would mean seniors would have to wait longer to get an appointment to file for benefits, would not receive timely benefit decisions or have their documents processed promptly, and that significant numbers of SSA employees would be furloughed.But the Democrats $1.7 billion figure uses the $12.5 billion that President Barack Obama proposed for the Social Security budget for 2011 as the baseline from which they claim cuts are being made.But that money was never allotted because no 2011 budget was passed. SSA has operated at the same $11.5 billion funding level it got in 2010.Republicans use $11.5 billion as a baseline to cite a lower level of cuts. Renacci spokeswoman Karin Davenport says the GOP bill would lop $125 million in administrative cuts from the agencys 2010 spending level. More cuts would come from rescinding another $118 million from a computer center thats not scheduled to be built until 2015, and from reclaiming $500 million from a reserve fund that Democrats say is already being tapped.If we set aside $1 billion of the Social Security cuts Democrats cite as phantom cuts coming from a budget that never materialized, that still leaves $700,000 that are acknowledged by both Republicans and Democrats.SSA did not return repeated telephone calls we made to determine the impact of those cuts. In their absence, we turned to Witold Skwierczynski , who heads the American Federation of Government Employees union that represents most of the nations SSA workers. While SSA isnt talking to reporters, it is talking to his union.Skwierczynski says SSA has told the union that if Congress reduces Social Securitys funding at all beneath FY 2010 levels, some level of furloughs would be imposed. SSA sent the union a letter on Feb. 17 that requested bargaining over the possible implementation of furloughs, though it didnt specify how long the furloughs might last.It is important to note that the Commissioner has not decided to effectuate a furlough, the letter said. However, given the potential of reduced Congressional appropriations for the remainder of the fiscal year, the Agency is issuing this notice at this time in the event that a furlough may become necessary.Skwierczynski says Obama requested a $1 billion increase in SSAs 2011 funding because of increased demands for its services, and called potential passage of the GOP budget a nightmare scenario for Social Security.You have to understand that we are a growth agency, he said. We are taking more and more claims because of the baby boom generations retirement and also because of the economic problems we have in this country. If people are laid off, they will file for retirement early. Many will file for disability, looking for a benefit they can receive to enable them to survive with out a job.If SSA workers are furloughed because of budget cuts or a government shutdown, beneficiaries would still get their regularly scheduled checks, Skweirczynski said. But furloughs would mean fewer workers available to process new claims and appeals. That would result in backlogs and delays in processing new paperwork. Thats what happened when furloughs were implemented during the government shutdowns of 1995 and 1996.Where does that leave Democrats claims about Renacci? There are some elements of truth in the DCCCs claim, but it stokes it up with hyperbole and leaves out several critical facts that would give listeners a different impression. On the Truth-O-Meter, that means Barely True."
5009,mostly-true,Rick Scott,We are the only state in the country that state employees don't contribute [to their pensions].,"Gov.-elect Rick Scott is taking office next month with big plans to cut state spending.One idea Scott has suggested is to cut $1.4 billion in state pension costs by making government employees contribute to their own retirement. Scott brought up the issue during the campaign and again on Dec. 14, 2010, in a meeting with state legislators.What do you all think about employees contributing to the pension plan?'' Scott asked legislators about ways to shrink state spending. We are the only state in the country that state employees don't contribute'' to their pensions.Last year, according to the Sarasota Herald-Tribune, the state and local governments contributed nearly $3.4 billion to the retirement fund, the Florida Retirement System. Governments typically contribute between 9 and 10 percent of an employee's annual income towardretirement. Employees are required to contribute nothing.Is Florida the only state with a system like that?Not quite, according to a PolitiFact Florida review of the state retirement systems of all 50 states. But Scott isn't far off either.PolitiFact Florida individually researched the state retirement systems across the country, as well as consulted with Ron Snell, the director of state services for the National Conference of State Legislatures. Snell studies state pension and retirement systems.Most state retirement systems are based on a defined benefit plan -- a system where the state multiplies an employee's years of service bysalaryandby some percentage to arrive at a pension amount. To qualify, employees have to be vested into the system -- meaning they work for the state for a certain number of years, often five. They also must contribute some percentage of their pay to the overall pension fund. (In most states, individualcontributions don't fund the retirement, but go into the overallpension fund.)A few states, however, have begun to adopt more private-sector-like 401(k) plans where the employee voluntarily contributes to a retirement fund and the employer eithermatches a portion of the contributions, or contributes on their own.And some states offer voluntary, optional 401(k) plans on top of a government pension.With state revenue sources drying up, states have been moving away from 100 percent employer-funded pensions to plans where employees are required to contribute.Missouri, for instance, will start making employees hired after Jan. 1, 2011, contribute 4 percent of their pay to their retirement plan, said Christine Rackers at the Missouri State Employees' Retirement System. Virginia lawmakers this year passed legislation requiring new employees to contribute 5 percent of their pay to their retirement. Current employees are operating under old rules where they do not have to contribute, though Virginia has discussed making them pay, too.Wisconsin also passed legislation making workers pay toward thepensionfund -- though their contribution is as little as .2 percent.Where are governments still footing the entire bill?The largest chunk of state employees in Utah are not required to contribute to their retirement. But a small percentage do.In Tennessee, state employees and higher education employees are not asked to pay toward their retirement, said spokesman Blake Fontenay. But some local government employees and all K-12 teachers are required to contribute, Fontenay said. The state, back in 1981, discussed either having employees contribute toward their retirement or forgo a pay raise that year, Fontenay said. The government chose no raise.And in Michigan, employees aren't necessarily required to contribute to their retirement because they have a traditional 401(k) plan, said Kurt Weiss with the state's Department of Technology, Management and Budget. The state contributes the equivalent of 4 percent of an employee's salary into a 401(k) regardless of whether the employee contributes. The state will then match up to an additional 3 percent employee contribution.A few other states exempt certain, small classes of employees -- like public safety employees -- from having to contribute to their retirement. But in every case, the bulk of state employees are required to participate in the state retirement system through payroll deductions.Wisconsin government analysts crafted a good synopsis of the state retirement plans in 2009 as that state was pondering changes. Contribution requirements are listed on Page 22.A note: Our analysis isn't meant to say Florida's retirement plan is a better deal for state employees than employees in other state governments. It's entirely possible that other state employeesreceive better pensions than Florida workers, even after accounting for employee contributions. Our focus solely was on where employees are asked to contribute to their retirement. And as we previously pointed out, Florida has the lowest payroll expenditures per resident -- $38 -- in the country, according to the state Department of Management Services. The national average was $72 per resident.Which brings us back to Scott's statement. In a meeting with state legislators, Scott suggested the state might save money by requiring state employees to contribute to their own retirement. Specifically, he said, that Florida is the only state in the country where government workers are not required to help fund their retirement.Scott is largely on the mark.Florida will be the only state, starting Jan. 1, 2011, where no one in the state retirement system is asked to contribute toward their pension. Two states -- Virginia and Missouri -- recently switched their retirement system meaning new hires will have to pay toward their retirement, but not existing employees. Michigan doesn't force its employees to participate either, but that state has a more private-sector-like 401(k) program. And Tennessee and Utah still do not require many of their state employees to contribute toward retirement, although other employees in those states do."
16662,mostly-true,Edward Flynn,"In 2012, there were nearly 12.2 million arrests and only 410 uses of deadly force by police in the United States.","In the wake of the fatal police shooting in Ferguson, Mo., Milwaukee Police Chief Edward Flynn was interviewed for nearly an hour on Wisconsin Public Radio about the incident and its implications. At one point during the Aug. 20, 2014 interview, Flynn told host Kathleen Dunn there are many reasons why (police) uses of force are dramatically down, and the main one is training. Then, alluding back to Ferguson, the chief added: It's an extraordinarily rare event. But the fact is, (in) 2012, there were 12,197,000 arrests in the United States, OK? And there were 410 uses of deadly force. Now that is, I think, three-thousands of a percent. So, its still an extraordinarily rare event. In the comparison Flynn uses, there is one police killing in 0.00003 percent of all arrests -- an even tinier fraction than he suggested. But expressed another way, the 410 is an average of more than one police killing per day. So, what about the two figures themselves: Are they accurate and do they account for all of the people who are killed by police? Renewed focus Around the country, attention to the use of deadly force by police was heightened after Michael Brown, an unarmed 18-year-old, was shot to death on Aug. 9, 2014, in Ferguson, a St. Louis suburb. In Milwaukee, residents held rallies to raise questions about the Brown case and about the April 2014 death of Dontre Hamilton, a 31-year-old who was shot multiple times by a police officer during a struggle in Red Arrow Park in downtown Milwaukee. (In Milwaukee, there was one police killing of a citizen in 2012, four in 2013 and two through late August of 2014, the Police Department told us.) PolitiFact National rated Half True a claim by conservative talk show host Michael Medved that more whites than blacks are victims of deadly police shootings. The claim ignored the fact that there are more than five times more whites than blacks in America. And our colleagues rated as False a statement that an unarmed black person is shot by a police officer every 28 hours. The report that had been cited by CNN pundit Marc Lamont Hill looked at all deaths, not just those of unarmed individuals. And it rolled in some deaths that did not involve police officers. Flynns claim Flynn, who headed the police departments in Arlington, Va., and Springfield, Mass., before becoming Milwaukees chief in 2008, is known nationally for his use of data. When we asked for evidence for Flynns claim, a Milwaukee police spokesman cited two FBI reports. Both are from 2012, the most recent full-year statistics available. There were 12,196,959 arrests across the country in 2012, which means the figure Flynn used -- 12,197,000 -- was rounded up only slightly. The highest numbers of those arrests were for drug abuse violations, driving under the influence and larceny-theft. There were also 410 cases of justifiable homicide in 2012, according to the FBI, which defines justifiable homicide as the killing of a felon by a law enforcement officer in the line of duty. For example: A police officer responding to a bank robbery alarm who shot a suspect after the suspect fired at the officer. But that doesnt taken into account all police killings of citizens. FiveThirtyEight.com, a news website devoted to data analysis, recently reported that the 410 is a minimum figure. The numbers are self-reported by local police agencies and not audited, not all police agencies report those figures to the FBI and the number doesnt include homicides that werent ruled justifiable. The FBI totals are likely an undercount for another reason, criminologists told us. Researchers who examine police killings of citizens within large metropolitan police departments often find that the number of such incidents recorded by the departments are higher than the number of justifiable homicides reported by the FBI. But the criminologists also noted Flynns comparison is one legitimate way to measure the frequency of police killings.  Our rating Flynn said that in 2012, there were nearly 12.2 million arrests and 410 uses of deadly force by police in the United States. The Milwaukee police chief correctly quotes official FBI statistics on arrests and justifiable homicides by law enforcement officers, although it appears the 410 is an undercount of the number of people killed by police.

7503,mostly-true,Cori Bush,"Approximately 60,000 Canadians currently live undocumented in the USA.","U.S. Rep. Cori Bush said the treatment of Haitians at the U.S. border is not about immigration but something more sinister — and she shared a statistic about ourNorth American neighbors to the north as evidence. Approximately 60,000 Canadians currently live undocumented in the USA, tweeted Bush, a Missouri Democrat, Sept. 23. You dont see the militarized presence, cops on horseback, and calls for a wall on that border. The issue has never been about immigration. Its about anti-Blackness and racism. Bushs criticism came as the Biden administration dealt with fallout from its handling of thousands of Haitian migrants who in September crossed the border illegally into Texas. Images and videos of Border Patrol agents pursuing the migrants prompted outcry from some within Bidens party, as did the administrations decision to expel thousands. For decades, the U.S. governments treatment of refugees has varied greatly depending on where they are from. An Associated Press analysis of asylum data, for example, found that from October 2018 through June 2021 Haitians were granted asylum at the lowest rate of any nationality. We wanted to know if Bush was right about the number of undocumented Canadians in the U.S. We found that her statistic is in the ballpark of some available data, but the data lacks precision. Bushs congressional office declined to comment since she tweeted from her personal account. Her campaign did not respond to our query. There is no exact science for calculating the size of the unauthorized population in the United States.We reached out to nonpartisan experts and found that while their estimates vary, they tend to be in the same ballpark. The Migration Policy Institute estimates that approximately 57,000 unauthorized immigrants from Canada resided in the United States as of 2018, accounting for less than 1% of the 11 million unauthorized immigrants in the country. Some of the largest pockets of unauthorized immigrants from Canada were in Los Angeles, the Boston area, Floridas Broward County, Arizonas Maricopa County, and Washington states King County, the Migration Policy Institute found. The Pew Research Center estimated that in 2017 there were about 80,000 unauthorized immigrants from Canada. That estimate had a margin of error of +/- 15,000, which puts it in the same ballpark as the Migration Policy Institute number. The number of unauthorized immigrants from Canada has been dropping steadily in recent years, said Jeffrey Passel, senior demographer at Pew. For unauthorized Canadians, a figure of 60,000 for today is roughly consistent with the findings of our research, Passel said. Robert Warren, a senior fellow at the Center for Migration Studies, estimated that in 2019 the undocumented Canadian population in the U.S. was 32,000. Warren is a former longtime demographer for the U.S. Census Bureau and the former Immigration and Naturalization Service. None of these estimates rely on post-COVID era data, so they do not reflect a snapshot of what has happened during a period when it has been more difficult to cross the U.S. border. The Department of Homeland Security releases annual reports on the number of foreign visitors who came to the U.S. legally, but stayed beyond the time period for which their admission had been authorized. These visitors are referred to as visa overstayers, although Canadians generally dont require a visa to visit the U.S. for a few months. Ravi Jain, a Toronto-based immigration lawyer who is also licensed to practice law in Massachusetts, told us that undocumented Canadians in the U.S. are often looking for work, some as models, actors and singers. When they get a gig, they stay. Sometimes they find a romantic partner in the U.S. and just just dont file the paperwork timely, too. The Homeland Security overstay report for 2019 showed out of about 10 million expected departures, there were about 84,000 suspected Canadian overstayers. The overstay estimates available could be inflated. To give a concrete exampleYou have a temporary visa that calls for you to leave the U.S. on Sept. 28 but you leave on Oct. 2. You will be counted as a suspected in-county overstay as of the end of the fiscal year (Sept. 30) even though you have left the country, Passel said. Bush tweeted that approximately 60,000 Canadians currently live undocumented in the USA. Its difficult to pinpoint a precise count of undocumented Canadians, but Bushs number is in the ballpark of data by experts including those at the Migration Policy Institute and the Pew Research Center.

13746,mostly-true,Joe Biden,"Thirty years ago, the United States ranked sixth among advanced economies in the share of women in the workforce. You know where we are today? Twenty-three.","During a visit to Howell, Mich., President Joe Biden touted key agenda items under negotiation in Congress. One of the proposals he wants to see receive final Congressional approval is support for child care, which he said would benefit both children and their parents, including mothers who want to take jobs outside the home. How can we compete in the world if millions of American parents, especially moms, cant join the workforce because they cant afford the cost of child care or elder care? They have to stay home, Biden said in the Oct. 5 speech. He went on to say that the United States had fallen behind its industrialized peers in the percentage of women in the labor force. Thirty years ago, the United States ranked sixth among advanced economies in the share of women in the workforce, Biden said. You know where we are today? Twenty-three. Twenty-two countries have a higher percentage of their women in the workforce making a competitive wage than the United States. While our competitors are investing in the care economy, were standing still. Has the United States really fallen so far behind in womens participation in the labor force? Our research shows it has. We asked the White House for a source, and they pointed to data from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, a think tank that studies advanced industrialized nations. The data broadly supports how Biden characterized the shifts between 1990 and 2020. There are multiple ways to measure the phenomenon Biden addressed — notably, what age ranges are used. If you look at the labor force participation rate for all women at least 15 years of age, the United States ranked seventh in 1990, behind Denmark, Sweden, Estonia, Finland, Norway and Canada. But by 2020, the United States ranking had fallen to 17th. (Labor force participation rate refers to the percentage of a given group that is either employed or is actively seeking work.) An alternative statistic — the labor force participation rate for women in the prime working ages of 25 to 54 — shows an even steeper U.S. decline. In 1990, the United States ranked seventh, behind the same six countries. But by 2020, the U.S. had fallen to 31st. The White House used a slightly different version of the OECD data than we did, which accounts for the differences in the U.S. rankings. But multiple economists told us that the differences in rankings were minor, and that the trend line was much more important. Specifically, the U.S. percentage of women working basically stagnated over those 30 years, even as 13 nations leapfrogged the U.S. between 1990 and 2020: Belgium, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Israel, Japan, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Portugal, Spain, and the United Kingdom.  However you define it, I think the president is highlighting genuine trends, said Gary Burtless, an economist with the Brookings Institution. Historically, women in the U.S. gravitated to the labor force earlier than women in other countries did. Right after World War II, only about one-third of U.S. women were in the labor force, but by the late 1990s, that percentage had risen steeply, to the low-60% range. Since then, however, it has plateaued and even fallen modestly overall.  By the early 1990s, the United States ranked higher on this measurement than most of its economic peers. Since the 1990s, the downturn has been driven mostly by married women with a college degree, particularly those married to high-earning men, said Stefania Albanesi, an economist at the University of Pittsburgh. Albanesi said her research suggests that a rise in earnings of college-educated men, particularly those at the top of the income distribution, has reduced the pressure for married women to take paying work outside the home. As the U.S. rate began to fall, other nations caught up. Several factors drove these international shifts, economists say. One is that women in other countries have belatedly made gains in educational attainment, giving them a boost in the labor market. But perhaps the biggest difference comes from the lack of social policies in the United States that enable women with children to take jobs. The policies that are common in other industrialized countries but not in the U.S. include publicly provided child care services, an entitlement to paid parental leave, laws giving workers the right to demand a change to a part-time work schedule without exception and without being discriminated against, said Mihaela Pintea, an economist at Florida International University. The upshot of the lack of such policies in the U.S. is that its costly or burdensome for women with kids to remain in the workforce after they have a child, Burtless said. Claudia Goldin, a Harvard University economist, cautioned that its tricky to make cross-national comparisons on labor-force participation. Perhaps the biggest factor complicating Bidens comparison is that countries define part-time work differently. Generally speaking, when looking only at participation among women who work full-time hours, the U.S. ranks higher in international comparisons, Goldin said. If you did this comparison just for full-time work, wed be up there, she said. If you weighted by hours, wed be up there. Pintea added that, despite grim statistics like those cited by Biden, U.S. women who are working may still be better positioned in some ways. Effectively, the U.S. labor market environment pushes women to either skip working entirely or take a full-time job, rather than finding a middle ground. In a lot of other countries, women might work part-time as opposed to full time and may be less likely to be promoted into managerial positions, or may have lower wages than their male counterparts because of their career path, she said. Biden said, Thirty years ago, the United States ranked sixth among advanced economies in the share of women in the workforce. You know where we are today? Twenty-three. The specific rankings vary a bit depending on what measure one uses, though by one measurement, the U.S. position is even worse than Biden said. The general conclusion is the same: The United States used to rank near the top of the pack of industrialized countries in womens participation in the labor force, but over the past 30 years, many other countries have leapfrogged the U.S. in that measurement, as the rate in the U.S. stagnated or even fell. Economists say the U.S. rate has been lagging for several reasons, including a lack of government policies encouraging child care and paid leave and other countries catching up to the United States earlier gains in womens educational attainment."
5336,mostly-true,Nancy Pelosi,House Democrats have a two-to-one advantage money-wise against House Republicans.,"On the Aug. 1, 2010, edition of ABC's This Week with Christiane Amanpour, the show's host asked House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., how she felt when President Barack Obama's spokesman, Robert Gibbs, suggested a few weeks earlier that the Democrats could lose their House majority in the fall elections. Pelosi exuded confidence. You know what, I'm speaker of the House, Pelosi said. I have a great chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, Chris Van Hollen. We have a solid plan of messaging and mobilizing at the grassroots level and management of our campaigns. And we have a two-to-one advantage money-wise. So we feel very confident about where we are, whether that's well known to that gentleman or not. We thought the part of Pelosi's comment worth checking was that House Democrats have a two-to-one advantage money-wise against House Republicans. Because Pelosi mentioned the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee just two sentences earlier, we began by looking at the money statistics for the DCCC and the parallel GOP organization, the National Republican Congressional Committee. Both groups work to elect members of their party to House seats. According to the Center for Responsive Politics, a Washington-based group that tracks money in politics, the DCCC had $33,783,724 in the bank through Aug. 3, 2010, compared to $17,039,525 for the NRCC, and neither committee had any debt. That works out almost exactly to a ratio of two-to-one -- just as Pelosi said. But while the DCCC/NRCC ratio for cash on hand is probably the best statistic to use, it isn't the only one. So we decided to look at a handful of others for comparison. -- The ratio of money raised for the DCCC and NRCC -- not just what's left in the bank. The DCCC has raised $93,706,323 during the 2009-2010 campaign cycle, compared to $75,531,984 for the NRCC. That's a 1.24 to 1 ratio -- a much more even split than cash on hand. -- Money totals raised and held by House candidates themselves, rather than by the DCCC or the NRCC. When you look at money raised by the candidates themselves, the Republicans have actually raised slightly more than the Democrats as of Aug. 3, 2010 -- $355,067,654 to $351,238,367. Meanwhile, Democrats running for the House have $245,223,757 in the bank, compared to $173,422,985 for Republican candidates. That's a ratio of about 1.4 to 1. Since the Republicans have more candidates running for the House, we also decided to adjust these numbers to reflect amounts raised and held per candidate. The Democrats lead in total money raised per House candidate, $589,326 to $323,670 -- a 1.82 to 1 ratio. They lead by an even larger ratio in cash on hand per House candidate -- $411,000 to $158,000, or 2.6 to 1. -- Independent expenditures. Independent expenditures are dollars spent on campaigning by sources other than the candidates' own campaign treasuries. Through July 11, 2010, $19,017,868 was spent independently either for Democratic candidates or against Republican candidates, compared to $7,776,690 spent in support of Republicans or against Democrats. That's a ratio of about 2.4 to 1 favoring Democratic candidates. So let's sum up. When comparing the DCCC and the NRCC in cash on hand, Pelosi is on target when she says that there's a two-to-one Democratic advantage. But using four other measures, the Democrats have a smaller lead, including one case in which the Republicans narrowly lead. Using two other measures, the Democrats have a lead of greater than two to one. Of course, these statistics can change before Election Day, and it's not especially surprising that the Democrats lead the Republicans in fundraising -- being the incumbent party in power. Either way, we think the single best statistic to use is the one Pelosi cited correctly, so we'll rate her comment Mostly True."
3528,mostly-true,Bernie Sanders,One out of five Americans cannot afford the cost of prescription drugs.,"In his press to deliver Medicare for All, Bernie Sanders says the core problem with health care is that it produces enormous profits for insurance and drug companies. Last year the top 10 drug companies, for example, made $69 billion in profit, Sanders told CNNs Brooke Baldwin April 30, while one out of five Americans cannot afford the cost of prescription drugs when doctors prescribe medicine to them. The Vermont senator and Democratic presidential candidate often brings up the unaffordability of drugs, and the one-in-five stat he used in his exchange with Baldwin was virtually identical to his words during his CNN town hall event a few days earlier. As part of our ongoing effort to check health care talking points in the presidential election, we took a closer look at whether one out of five people cant afford their prescription drugs. • The most reliable data show that about 10% of people say the cost of drugs imposes a significant hardship. • About 20% to 30% say that due to cost, they didnt take a drug as the doctor recommended. • About one out of three people use some strategy to reduce prescription drug costs, which includes asking their doctor for a cheaper drug. Not all surveys are created equal. One of the most reliable is the governments National Health Interview Survey. It reaches about 25,000 households and in 2017 it asked them how they tried to reduce the cost of their prescription drugs. About 11% said they did not take medications as prescribed. That could include not filling a prescriptionor stretching out one they had by not taking as much of the drug as they should. If thats the measure of affordability, then about one out of 10, not one out of five, cant afford their medications. But the survey revealed other strategies to cut costs that push the fraction higher. About 5% said they use alternative therapies, and nearly 20% said they ask their doctor for a cheaper drug. Another well-regarded survey confirms the government results, and adds a few wrinkles that make it harder to draw simple conclusions. The Kaiser Family Foundation, a reliable source of neutral health policy data, reported in February that 9% of respondents said it was very difficult to afford the cost of their prescription drugs. But another 15% said it was difficult. This is based on prescription drug users. Out of all adults, 6% say its very difficult and 9% say its somewhat difficult to afford their medications. These results highlight the ambiguities in Sanderss statement. Theres no precise point where a drug becomes unaffordable. While having difficulty paying for medicine isnt the same as not being able to afford it at all, it can be closely related and can lead to cost-related nonadherence — not taking the drugs as prescribed, Stacie Dusetzina, a health policy professor at Vanderbilt University, told us. In some cases, this can be worse for people than not taking the drugs at all. Dusetzina, and Sanders policy team, pointed to another part of the Kaiser survey that asked if people had not filled a prescription because of the cost. Nearly 20% answered, yes. Another 12% said they had skipped a dose or cut their pills in half. It is very hard to define affordability, especially for drugs, said University of Pittsburgh pharmacy professor Inmaculada Hernandez. They are very important goods since they can save lives, so people may forgo use of other services or products to afford them. Hernandez said that if people scrimp on basics such as food or clothing to pay for their drugs, that basically says that affordability is a significant problem. On the other hand, the Kaiser survey data suggests that people might not see every prescription as vital to their health. Out of those who didnt take a prescription as recommended, two thirds said their condition did not get worse. The third survey comes from Gallup, which produced a report on behalf of West Health, a group focused on lowering health care costs for seniors. Gallup found that about 20% of people said that at some point in the past year, they had been unable to pay for medicine or drugs because they didnt have enough money to pay for them. Looking at that and the Kaiser data, Stanford University health policy professor Michelle Mello said nearly 30% of people dont take a prescription drug as recommended due to cost. She said, Sanders's estimate is on the low side. Sanders said that one out of five people cant afford their prescription drugs. There is some evidence for this. About 20% of people in a Kaiser survey said they had not filled a prescription because of the cost, and another 12% said they took less than the prescription called for. But affordability is hard to measure. Only about 10 percent said it was very difficult to pay for their medications. Another 15% said it was difficult. These are subjective terms, and neither says that people went entirely without their medications. The experts we reached said affordability is a significant issue. The survey data dont precisely match up with Sanderss words, but they support the idea that many people are pressed to pay for their medications."
12395,mostly-true,Steve Adler,57% of the jobs created in Austin from 2009 to 2013 do not pay families a living wage.,"Austin isnt as affordable as it needs to be, mayoral aspirant Steve Adler says on his campaign website, adding: Our children cannot afford to live in the Austin where they grew up when they graduate and leave home. Even during a time of historic job growth, 57% of the jobs created from 2009 to 2013 do not pay families a living wage. We wondered about that percentage. By email, Adlers campaign manager, Jim Wick, said Adler saw the figure in an April 26, 2014, Austin American-Statesman news analysis by Dan Zehr citing data compiled by Idaho-based Economic Modeling Specialists International, which analyzes workforce-related data. That story said that while the Austin metro area had gained thousands of jobs in recent years, inflation-adjusted earnings had fallen. Then came the declaration that drew Adlers attention, which didnt speak generally to families or to jobs in Austin alone. From 2009 to 2013, the article said, almost 57 percent of the newly created jobs in the area paid less than the living wage for a single parent with one child ($19.56 per hour), according to data from EMSI and the oft-cited living wage calculator created by researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. That living-wage figure, identical for Travis and Williamson counties, appears on web pages overseen by Amy Glasmeier, an MIT professor of economic geography and regional planning. According to the entries, the living wage is the hourly rate that an individual must earn to support their family, if they are the sole provider and are working full-time (2,080 hours per year). To our inquiry, Zehr provided a spreadsheet he built based on increases or decreases in jobs across more than 730 professions in the Austin-Round Rock Metropolitan Statistical Area, also showing the estimated median hourly wage for each of the professions. By email, EMSI spokesman Joshua Wright said its median hourly wage data came from the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics and that information was benchmarked to the firms own industry-by-industry data drawn from agencies like the BLS and U.S. Census Bureau. By our calculation, some 53,315 of the 92,620 net jobs added in the Austin area from 2009 to 2013, or 58 percent, had a median hourly wage less than the living wage for a single parent with one child. These lower-wage jobs encompassed 394 types of jobs including positions in oil, gas and mining as well as loan interviewers and clerks, pest control workers, skin-care specialists and medical secretaries, according to the spreadsheet. In reviewing these details, we also wondered if the outcomes for Austin workers were as dire as Adler said. For instance, the MIT website presents lower living wages including, for Travis and Williamson counties, $18.51 an hour for two adults and a child; $14.88 for two adults only; and $9.43 for one adult alone. If you focus on earnings at a lower living wage, in turn, youre going to conclude more workers fared better. According to the spreadsheet, for instance, 40,560 of the 92,620 net jobs gained from 2009 to 2013, or 44 percent, had median hourly wages less than $14.88; 15,099 of the net jobs gained, 16 percent, had median hourly wages less than $9.43. It also occurred to us the median wage might not be a perfect way to gauge who exactly is earning enough to get by. That is, the median wage in each occupation is the boundary between the highest paid 50 percent and the lowest paid 50 percent of workers. It stands to reason, then, that some workers in the 57 percent still made more than the living wage for a single parent with a child. But its also so that some of the other 43 percent made less than the same living wage.  The limits of public wage data evidently make it difficult to calculate a precise percentage. Next, for an independent look at this claim, we turned to Cynthia Osborne, a University of Texas associate professor and director of the Child and Family Research Partnership at the Lyndon B. Johnson School of Public Affairs. By email, Osborne told us the 57 percent figure might be right, but shed need more information -- particularly the variations in wages around each median -- to reach a conclusion. EMSIs Wright told us he didnt have that type of information, but could share the wages for each occupation at specific points along the wage curve. Daniel Dillon, a research associate for the partnership, later said three interpolations drawing on this added detail basically confirmed about 57 percent of the jobs added in the Austin area didnt pay the living wage for an adult with one child. Our ruling Adler said: 57% of the jobs created from 2009 to 2013 do not pay families a living wage. To be precise, thats the estimated share of net jobs added in the multi-county Austin area (not Austin alone) pegged as having median wages less than the living wage for an adult with one child. Families vary in size, though, as do related living wages. MOSTLY TRUE – The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information.

15609,mostly-true,Barack Obama,"By one leading measure, what business owners pay out in wages and salaries is now finally growing faster than what they spend on health insurance for the first time in 17 years.","Even if youre not a direct beneficiary of Obamacare, youve reaped its benefits, said President Barack Obama in response to the Supreme Courts ruling upholding elements of the Affordable Care Act. By one leading measure, what business owners pay out in wages and salaries is now finally growing faster than what they spend on health insurance. That hasn't happened in 17 years, he said on June 25. Obamas point is that employers have been spending more and more on health care, so they couldnt increase wages. Now, he says, health care costs are reined in, which means workers can get more in their paychecks. We wanted to know if Obama was right that this was the first time this has happened since 1998. The White House told us Obama got his numbers from the Bureau of Labor Statistics Employment Cost Index, which measures changes in employee compensation over time. The data shows that, in the past 17 years, wages grew faster than health care in just one 12-month period, and it was recently: from March 2014 to March 2015. Health care costs grew by 2.5 percent, compared to a2.6 percent rise in wages.  Obamas claim was specific in looking at the growth in employer health care costs from year to year. Other measures have found similar trends when looking at changes over longer periods of times and employee share of the insurance tab. Bloomberg, for example, bookended a 25-year period and found that health costs for business almost quadrupled from 1987 to 2012, while wages doubled. According to a report from the health care think tank the Commonwealth Fund, between 2003 and 2013, average family premiums jumped 73 percent, while median family income increased by 16 percent. While Obamas numbers are accurate, experts had a few words of caution. First, its too early to tell how big of a role Obamacare played in curbing health care costs. Beyond legislation, experts also count the recession and a slowdown in medical advancements as potential reasons. I don't think people know the exact relationship between health care costs and Obamacare, said Janet Currie, a professor of labor and health economics at Princeton University. I think (the claim) is true now. Whether it'll be true next quarter is another matter. Second, because wages and health benefits are typically a zero-sum game, Obamas purported impact on paychecks could go both ways. Because of the (laws) increasing binding tax or penalty on the Cadillac insurance plans, some employers may scale back on the generosity of plans and shift compensation towards wages, said Jeffrey Clemens, a professor of health economics at the University of California San Diego. Small firms may be pushed the other way, he said:If their insurance packages fall short, firms in that position would need to increase benefits and maybe take from wages. Third, less expensive health care isnt necessarily something to cheer about. It could reflect more bang for your buck and a more efficient system, but if the price reflects the quality of care or access to it, cheaper doesnt mean better, said Clemens. Our ruling Obama said, by one leading measure, what business owners pay out in wages and salaries is now finally growing faster than what they spend on health insurance for the first time in 17 years, and he credited the Affordable Care Act. His claim is backed by numbers from the Bureau of Labor Statistics that compare change in costs over a 12-month period: Wages grew faster than health care costs for the first time since 1998 between March 2014 and March 2015. Experts say Obama used the BLS data accurately and reasonably. They did caution that the law's role in this dynamic is still uncertain, and more data may show different results."
368,mostly-true,Alma Adams,"The President wants to cut 3 MILLION people from SNAP, including children, seniors and veterans.","Over Thanksgiving week, a North Carolina Democrat drew attention to a Trump Administration proposal that would cut the number of people who receive public funding for food. U.S. Rep. Alma Adams, a Democrat representing the Charlotte area, tweeted on Nov. 26 about the administrations proposal for cuts to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, known as SNAP. The President wants to cut 3 MILLION people from #SNAP, including children, seniors and veterans, Adams tweeted. This is unacceptable. SNAP is the first line of defense against hunger and I stand with @TheBlackCaucus to protect Americas most vulnerable: our children. #1MillionKids. Is it true that the Trump administration is proposing to cut 3 million people from the SNAP program? Does that proposal include children, seniors and veterans? There are multiple proposed changes to the SNAP program, The SNAP program provides nutritional assistance to people who are low-income or disabled. Adams referred to proposed changes to categorical eligibility. And, as it turns out, the Adams claim is mostly on-point. 3 million The proposed change to categorical eligibility rules would affect 3.1 million people currently receiving those benefits, according to the USDAs own estimates. SNAP currently allows states to grant categorical eligibility to people who are already on other social programs. The USDA believes some those people wouldnt qualify otherwise. As a result, some households can qualify when they would not under regular programs rules, the department wrote in a fact sheet. The Trump administration sees this change as closing a loophole allowing some to abuse a program thats intended to be a temporary safety net, NPR reported. Whos affected? We reached out to the USDAs Food and Nutrition Service department for insight on how many SNAP participants might be affected by the proposed change. An estimated 673,000 households with seniors and 597,000 households with children are projected to lose benefits, the USDAs communications office told us in an email. As for military veterans, the number is a little less clear. We reached out to the USDA and other groups that track SNAP beneficiaries, but struggled to find a specific number of veterans that might be affected. Veterans not tracked USDA does not have data to determine the specific impacts of the rule on households with veterans, as veteran status does not impact eligibility and therefore is not captured in the caseload data used to analyze the rule, the USDA told us. But its possible veterans would be affected. About 40 million people participate in the SNAP program. About 1.4 million veterans live in participating SNAP households, according to a 2018 study by the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. The center analyzed data provided by the U.S. Census Bureau and estimated SNAP is currently assisting 55,000 veterans in North Carolina. Rebecca Vallas, a senior fellow at the left-leaning Center for American Progress, believes its more than fair to conclude veterans would be affected. She believes Adams is on strong footing. Our ruling Adams said President Trump wants to cut 3 million people from SNAP, including children, seniors and veterans. Its true that his administrations proposal would affect 3 million people, including children and seniors. Veterans also receive SNAP benefits, but we dont know how many veterans would be directly affected. Given that uncertainty, we believe Adams statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information."
5013,mostly-true,Joe Biden,"If the vaccine came out tomorrow, how in the heck would we get it to people? There is no game plan.","Scientists have expressed cautious optimism that a vaccine will be ready in the spring of 2021 (and President Donald Trump has hinted at an even more aggressive timeline). But that has raised a key question: Does the federal government have a plan to distribute it? Former Vice President Joe Biden says no. If the vaccine came out tomorrow, how in the heck would we get it to people? There is no game plan they have, Biden told associations that represent Black and Hispanic journalists Aug. 6. How would everybody in America have access to it? It is a gigantic problem to distribute, even if we have it, and thats what we should be planning for now, not when we get it. The federal government has not yet released a plan about how it will distribute vaccines. But in the past two weeks, federal officials have spoken about vaccine distribution planning, including the role of the Defense Department. And committees are working on recommendations about how to distribute the vaccine, while the CDC asked a few to join a pilot program to plan for distribution. There is no national COVID-19 vaccination distribution plan, yet. So that is true, said Michael Fraser, CEO of the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials. Most of the experts we spoke with said the governments efforts have been too slow, and states face too many unknowns to do their part in planning to vaccinate millions of people. This is going to be the most challenging, complex mass vaccination program ever attempted, said Dr. Kelly Moore, who works at the Immunization Action Coalition and ran Tennessee's H1N1 vaccination program. Its not yet known precisely when the vaccine will be available to the public. Six vaccines are in the third phase of testing that involves thousands of patients. Like earlier phases, this one looks at the safety of a vaccine, but it also examines effectiveness and collects more data on side effects. Results of the third phase will be submitted to the Food and Drug Administration. After the FDA licenses the vaccine, recommendations will be given about who should get the vaccine, and distribution will follow, said Dr. Carol Baker, a pediatrician who is an alternate liaison to a COVID-19 vaccines working group. Federal health officials have generally predicted that the vaccine will be available in early 2021. There are two committees working on recommendations for the CDC about vaccine distribution. The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, a long-standing committee at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, formed a COVID-19 vaccines working group in April. The groups next meeting on Aug. 26 will be publicly live streamed. Recommendations about who should get the vaccine first are expected by the fall. The committee has wrestled with questions about whether to prioritize groups who have been infected at higher rates, such as Black and Latino people. Another difficult question is defining who is an essential worker. There is no right answer there, said Dr. William Schaffner, a professor of preventive medicine at Vanderbilt University, a liaison to the working group. Grocery store workers vs. long haul truckers vs. people who work to keep the electrical grid up ... you can go on and on. Your priority list is valid, but so is mine. In July, the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine and the National Academy of Medicine formed a committee to help make a plan for vaccine distribution. Some experts told us its unclear why there are two separate committees working on the same task, while others said the CDC group will be the key group to make recommendations to the CDC. One key question has been about Trumps comments that the military would be involved with logistics of vaccine distribution, a first. Trump told reporters July 28 that the military is all mobilized. Its been fully set up. When we have that vaccine, it will be discharged and taken care of. Itll be a very rapid process all over the country. But a McClatchy report the next day cast doubt on Trumps statements. Two defense officials told McClatchy that the military commands most likely to be involved in a delivery strategy had not been asked to prepare one. A Health and Human Services official told McClatchy that military help may not be required at all, and it would be the exception, not the norm. A Biden campaign spokesman pointed to the conflicting statements to argue that no distribution plan exists. Following McClatchys article, administration officials held a conference call with reporters about vaccination distribution. (For our fact-check, the White House and other administration officials directed us to the transcript of that press phone call.) A senior administration official said the Defense Department will handle the logistics of distribution and kitting, which means the packaging of the vaccine, along with related equipment, including needles, syringes and vials. The CDC will handle tracking of patients following vaccination and communications with state health departments. An official said that the distribution will be different from the seasonal flu vaccine because the government will actively target vulnerable groups, such as people in nursing homes and frontline health care workers. Another key piece of vaccine distribution planning lies with the states. The CDC launched a pilot program with North Dakota, Florida, California and Minnesota as well as the city of Philadelphia to work on a vaccination response, according to a letter written by Nancy Messonnier, a CDC official, Aug. 4. While the letter says that the pilot program will be a model for other states, it doesnt give states much time to receive and implement the best practices from that pilot program. The states have until the end of September to develop vaccination plans that will then be reviewed by the CDC and Operation Warp Speed, the federal governments effort to fasttrack the availability of vaccines. Those plans should include mass vaccination clinics, signing agreements with providers and identifying high-risk communities that will require additional outreach. States must be allowed sufficient time to absorb what has been learned in these pilots and customize it to their own specific state and needs, said James Blumenstock, chief program officer for health security at the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials. Everyone questions if all of that can be done successfully between now and Sept 30. States can build off of their existing programs to administer childhood vaccines and the seasonal flu shot, and the H1N1 vaccine in 2009. But the delivery of COVID-19 vaccine poses some additional challenges. For example: H1N1 was a single dose vaccine. The federal government has told states to prepare for a two-dose COVID-19 vaccine that will need to be administered likely three or four weeks later. While about 90 million people received the H1N1 vaccine, the federal government is planning for 300 million people to receive COVID-19. Vaccines may have cold storage rules of around minus 80 degrees Celsius, far colder than other vaccines. Weve never distributed a vaccine that required that before, Moore said. We dont have a cold chain that exists currently that can take that. States have been directed to write plans for distribution without knowing important details about the vaccines and how much federal money they will receive to help with an unprecedented vaccination effort. Vaccination planning efforts are not as far along as they should be if the first COVID-19 vaccines actually do become available for shipping as early as late 2020, Moore said. Much of this delay has come from confusion at the federal level about who is directing the implementation of the national vaccination program. States cannot make firm plans with their private sector partners until these basic decisions are made at the federal level and until they are told how the federal government intends for vaccines to reach them. Biden said that if the vaccine came out tomorrow, how in the heck would we get it to people? There is no game plan. Biden is correct that there isnt a detailed vaccine distribution plan written by the federal government at this time. But the vaccine isnt coming out tomorrow, and a federal plan is in the works. There are committees working on recommendations for vaccine distribution to include which groups should get the vaccine first. The CDC also asked four states and a city to pilot a program for vaccine distribution. Nationwide, states are expected to submit their own vaccination distribution plans by the end of Septemberto the federal government. There are a lot of unanswered questions that will affect vaccine distribution. But the planning is happening. "
20923,mostly-true,Chip Rogers,Rail doesnt do a great job in lessening traffic.,"The vote may be a year away, but politicians are already taking sides on a bid to raise taxes for more roads and rail in metro Atlanta.If it passes, the 2012 transportation referendum would bring more than $6 billion for a regional project list for the gridlocked area, possibly including a new rail line between Cobb County and Midtown. So far, though, political leaders in car-centric Cobb are less than thrilled, according to an Aug. 23 article in The Marietta Daily Journal.State Senate Majority Leader Chip Rogers is thinking about voting no on the 1-percent, 10-year sales tax.We know that rail offers some things that you can't get from just building roads, but we also know that rail doesn't do a great job in lessening traffic, Rogers said. And at a time when we need traffic to be lessened significantly, I don't know that we would put 55 percent of all our resources into that alone.Rogerswas referring to the 55 percent-45 percent split for mass transit -- which includes rail and buses -- to roads in the metro Atlanta project list for the 2012 transportation referendum. The list is a draft that faces further approval.Rogers, whose Woodstock district also includes portions of Cobb County, expanded on his remarks in an email to PolitiFact Georgia. He cited a number of studies to make his point.While I readily admit that transit may have a number of benefits that should be considered for infrastructure investment, relieving traffic congestion is not one of the major benefits, he wrote.Rail doesnt do a great job of reducing traffic? Doesnt rail get cars off the roads?Transportation experts said that rails impact is difficult to suss out. Congestion is influenced by so many variables, including population growth, the economy and geography, that researchers differ on rails exact impact.On its face, the problem seems simple. If a person who commutes alone by car takes the train instead, then thats one less car on the road.But multiple experts told PolitiFact Georgia that even if thousands of drivers take the train rather than a major road, congestion on that road doesnt end.It might drop initially, but travelers soon notice the better traffic. Commuters who once avoided the road return. Others take additional trips, or start using it during peak traffic times. People who carpooled start commuting alone.Eventually, congestion returns, said Anthony Downs, a Brookings Institution fellow who has studied traffic congestion for decades. He thinks congestion is extremely hard to avoid, and will likely grow worse. Brookings is a liberal-leaning think tank.Rogershas a point, he said.He is correct, but he is stating it very simply, Downs said. For instance, a 2009 University of Toronto study that analyzed interstate highway and vehicle travel data across the U.S. found there is little evidence that additional public transit reduces traffic. Other researchers have come to similar conclusions.But theres another important side to the traffic conundrum, and Rogers didnt address it. Decades of research shows that additional highway lanes dont end gridlock, either. As with rail, drivers fill up the new lanes. Once again, theyre stuck in traffic. Nothing solves the congestion problem. Neither option [cars or rail] takes precedent, said Catherine Ross, director of Georgia Techs Center for Quality Growth. A past board member of the Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority, she thinks rail can create better commutes and improve a regions overall quality of life. Some experts told PolitiFact Georgia that this does not mean rail has no chance of impacting traffic. Downs noted that if a city built a rail line alongside a major roadway with stops at busy exits, it could have a shot. And University of California at Berkeley Professor Robert Cervero said that such a line can have an especially big impact on congestion during rush hour because research shows rail carries a large share of travelers during those times.Indeed, a 2003 report published by the World Bank on 14 cities suggests that transit, including rail, does have a modest impact on congestion. People drive even less if a city has many characteristics that make using transit more attractive, such as high density and easy access.One expert argued that rail could have a major impact on traffic. Professor Vukan Vuchic, a University of Pennsylvania professor of city and regional planning, said that a long-term transportation and development plan that encourages drivers to use transit and makes it inconvenient to drive could reduce congestion.And speaking of inconvenient places to drive -- consider New York City. Experts noted that its rail helps the city accommodate far more travelers than the roads could. This avoids gridlock that those travelers would create.In the end, though, the bulk of the experts we interviewed agreed that the one tested way to cut down on gridlock is congestion pricing. Thats when drivers pay a surcharge to use roads during peak traffic hours. Cities such as London and Singapore have used the strategy and eased downtown traffic. How do we rule?Rogers claim was that rail doesn't do a great job in lessening traffic, and there is a great deal of truth to this.A rail line can do many things. It can take drivers off the road. A well-designed line has a shot at impacting congestion. And if a city or neighborhood is especially dense and designed around rail, it cant prosper without it. But rail alone cannot end congestion. A few experts argue that it does little to nothing.That said, Rogers left out an important fact that might have opened his take on the transportation tax to obvious criticism: No increase in capacity -- not even the construction of new road lanes -- can end congestion. Roads and rail have similar effects.Rogers statement is accurate, but could have used a little more context."
18700,mostly-true,Elizabeth Warren,The average family not in the top 10 percent makes less money today than they were making a generation ago.,"Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., believes the governments economic policies over the past few decades have cut the legs out from underneath America's middle class. At the AFL-CIO National Summit on Raising Wages Jan. 7, Warren spoke about growing income inequality, particularly since the 1980s, when the trickle-down economics policies gained traction under former President Ronald Reagan. She argued that this theory -- that giving tax breaks and other economic benefits to corporations and the wealthy will benefit the poor by improving the economy overall -- hasnt worked. Warren, a former law professor and expert on the economic challenges of the middle class, cited a number of statistics to support her point, including: Well, since 1980, guess how much of the growth in income over the last 32 years -- how much of the growth in income did the 90 percent get? Zero. None. Nothing. In fact, it is worse than that. The average family not in the top 10 percent makes less money today than they were making a generation ago. We wondered if that was true -- that the bottom 90 percent of earners in America have a lower income than they had more than 30 years ago. The statistic comes from data compiled by well-known economists Thomas Piketty and Emmanuel Saez, who study income inequality. Their World Top Incomes Database specializes in cataloging the highest level of incomes over time in more than 20 countries. To check out Warrens claim, we looked at average income data from 1979 to 2012 for the top 10 percent and bottom 90 percent of earners. (The time frame Warren used in her speech was a generation, which is vague, but in context its clear shes talking about since the 1980s.) The Saez-Piketty data comes from millions of tax returns filed over the past century. The data supports her claim. Adjusted for inflation, the top 10 percent of earners in the United States made, on average, $144,418 in 1979 and $254,449 in 2012. Thats about 76 percent growth. The bottom 90 percent of earners, on the other hand, made $33,526 in 1979 and $30,438 in 2012. Thats a decrease of about 9 percent. This chart generated on the Saez-Piketty top income database shows the growth of the top 10 percent of earners average income over time, compared to the relatively stagnant progression of the bottom 90 percent of earners average income.  Compare this to the 30 years prior, where -- according to Saez and Pikettys data -- the average income for the bottom 90 percent of earners grew alongside the top 10 percent, albeit at a slower pace.  However there is some context to consider. Mainly, not everyone approves of the Saez-Piketty approach to cataloging income. Their approach uses pre-tax income and includes realized capital gains. Because the richest Americans earn a lot of capital gains and pay a lot of taxes, this arguably magnifies their income. On the other hand, the approach lowballs the income of lower-level earners -- the bottom 90 percent in this case. The income calculation does not include government payments, such as Social Security, unemployment insurance, food stamps and the earned income tax credit. Salim Furth, an economist at the conservative Heritage Foundation, also noted that the data looks at tax units -- individuals or married couples filing together -- rather than households, which may artificially lower averageincomes. For example, a young adult living with hisparents are two separate tax units;together they are one household or family. The Saez-Piketty data captures that the young worker has a very small income, but not the fact that he lives in a house with multiple incomes. Also, tax law has changed over the past 50 years to increase the number of units, Furth said. Of the general trend in income growth, he said, Data sources that are more widely used show solid, though not fantastic, income growth for most of the income distribution through 2007. There are big losses in the Great Recession, and then an incomplete recovery since then. The Congressional Budget Office produced a report in November 2014 showing that the bottom 80 percent of earners (measured by households rather than tax units) saw income increases of about 16 percent between 1979 and 2011. The top 81-99 percent, on the other hand, saw increases of about 56 percent over the period. And the top 1 percent alone saw their household income grow 174 percent. That report also found that if it includes government benefits in its income calculation, all income brackets saw even more income growth. Still, this data shows that top earners incomes are growing at a faster pace than everyone elses -- which supports Warrens broader point.  Richard Burkhauser, an economist at Cornell University, pointed us to a paper he co-wrote on income inequality that compares Saez-Piketty-style data to other income measurements. The results are consistent with the Saez-Piketty data until households are adjusted for size, and capital gains taxes and government payments are factored in. With those controls, incomes have grown across the board, and income inequality has also grown -- but not at as dramatic a rate as the Saez-Piketty data implies. Ultimately, Burkhausers report concludes that different measurements work for different policy questions. If Warrens talking specifically about market income -- that is, income earned before taxes and before government payments -- the Saez-Piketty data is appropriate, and undoubtedly income inequality has grown substantially in recent years, and the middle class is struggling. If the question is, alternatively, whether government programs are doing something to close the gap and help the middle class -- other measures show that programs like food stamps and Medicaid are helping to a certain extent, at least for people who qualify. (And of course not everyone in the bottom 90 percent of earners does qualify.) Arguably, in a speech directed at working and middle-class Americans at a summit on raising wages, the context of Warrens remarks give credence to the fact that she was referencing data that emphasizes earned income over government-provided income. In the speech, Warren wasnt advocating for new government programs that give out payments to individuals in need. She was making a policy argument against the idea of trickle-down economics and in favor of broad economic policies that she believes would improve Americans job-earned income, like raising the minimum wage and breaking up the Wall Street banks. We can make new choices, she said. And one way to make those choices is to talk openly and honestly and directly about work, about how we value work, and how we value those who do the work. Our ruling Warren said, The average family not in the top 10 percent makes less money today than they were making a generation ago. According to one measurement, the bottom 90 percent of American earners had a lower income in 2012 than they had 30 years ago. By other measurements -- mainly ones that include government payments such as Social Security -- incomes have grown across the board. However, this data still supports Warrens overall point that income inequality is growing. Additionally, given the context of her speech at a forum about wages, it makes sense that Warren would reference data that gives more weight to pre-tax income. Shes arguing that middle-class wages havent increased enough over the past couple decades. Help fund PolitiFacts Kickstarter to live fact-check the 2015 State of the Union and GOP response."
19841,true,Jack Reed,"North Korea has a substantial standing army, one of the largest, certainly the largest per capita, in the world.","In recent weeks, the North Korean government has made numerous increasingly provocative statements threatening South Korea and the United States, at one point warning South Korea that our retaliatory action will start without any notice from now.  As the rhetoric was escalating, U.S. Sen. Jack Reed, a Rhode Island Democrat, spoke of North Koreas military capabilities during an appearance on WJAR Channel 10s 10 News Conference. Reed was asked about North Koreas recent moves and generally about what threat it could pose to the United States. Reed said that there is concern that, in five or more years, North Korea could increase its capability to launch nuclear missiles that travel longer ranges. They have a substantial standing army, one of the largest, certainly the largest per capita, in the world, he said of their conventional, non-nuclear, military. We wanted to know whether North Korea -- officially the Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea -- really has such a large force, based on the best-known information. The caveat of best-known is underscored by a recent New York Times news analysis, which reported on the difficulties the United States faces getting accurate intelligence about the country and raised questions about the accuracy of information about things such as nuclear weapons. We contacted Chip Unruh, Reeds spokesman, who e-mailed links to several documents. One is a U.S. Department of Defense report to Congress on North Korea that says that countrys total military -- army, air and naval capabilities -- ranks in personnel numbers as the fourth largest military in the world. It fields primarily legacy equipment, the report states, meaning hardware based on designs of the Soviet Union and China, dating back to the 1950s, 60s and 70s, though a few systems are based on modern technology. According to the Department of Defense report, at about 950,000, the ground forces comprise the vast majority of North Koreas military. The report estimates that country has some 60,000 naval personnel and 92,000 air force personnel -- a total of about 1.1 million. Several other sources provided by Unruh, including a March 28, 2012, statement before the House Armed Services Committee by Gen. James D. Thurman, commander of the United States-South Korea combined forces, supported the statement that North Korea has the fourth largest military in terms of sheer manpower, behind China, the United States and India. The 2012 U.S. Department of States Bureau of East Asian and Pacific Affairs fact sheet said the estimated active-duty military force in North Korea is as many as 1.2 million personnel. Unruh also supplied a link to a short 2011 article and graphic in The Economist magazine. Using data from 161 countries for which such information was available, according to the magazine, the graphic said China had the largest active military in number of personnel -- more than 2.25 million -- while the United States was second with upward of 1.5 million active-duty personnel. India was third in manpower. The Economist placed North Korea fourth in overall personnel at about 1.2 million, but the Economist also noted that, if looked at per population, North Korea was, by far, the most heavily militarized of all, saying there were 49 military personnel for every 1,000 North Koreans -- a ratio greater than that of any other nation. China has a population estimated at 1.3 billion people, with 1.7 military personnel for every 1,000 Chinese, and the United States has a population estimated at more than 316 million, with 5.5 military personnel per 1,000. We checked the CIAs latest estimate, for July 2013, which put North Koreas population at about 24.7 million people. Finally, we contacted the International Institute for Strategic Studies, which issues an annual report The Military Balance on nations military capabilities. Mark Fitzpatrick, director of the institutes nonproliferation and disarmament program, e-mailed that Reeds statement sounds correct to me but suggested checking the militaries of some smaller nations such as Israel. The Economist reported that Israel had 23 military personnel per 1,000 population. Of course, sheer manpower numbers arent necessarily a good measure of a nations military capability. And analysts often assert that much of North Koreas technology and hardware is outdated or obsolete. But thats beyond the scope of our analysis. Our ruling U.S. Sen. Jack Reed, D-R.I., said, of North Korea: They have a substantial standing army, one of the largest, certainly the largest per capita, in the world. Numerous publicly available documents support his claim."
14687,true,Tom Barrett,"Says since he took office, the City of Milwaukee has seen the creation of 7,000 new affordable housing units.","Seeking his fifth term as mayor, Tom Barrett has focused on bringing more jobs and housing to Milwaukee, among other issues. On the campaign trail, and again in his Feb. 10. 2020 State of the City address, Barrett has touted his 10,000 Homes Initiative, announced in 2018, which aims to increase affordable housing availability in the city by building or improving 10,000 housing units within 10 years. That reminded us of a claim from his Nov. 20, 2019 campaign launch we wanted to check. I am more optimistic now than I have ever been about the future of our city, Barrett said during that speech, before touting various accomplishments. Its about building for the future of this city. Weve done so by creating homes, 7,000 homes. The issue of housing in Milwaukee has also entered the mayoral race. Primary opponents, including state Sen. Lena Taylor, D-Milwaukee, have criticized Barretts record on housing. Is Barrett, first elected in April 2004, correct that 7,000 homes have been created since he took office? Lets take a look. When asked for the evidence to back up the claim, Barretts staff directed PolitiFact Wisconsin to a Department of City Development (DCD) report. The report shows that as of October 2019, a total of 7,261 affordable housing units had been developed since Barrett took office in 2004. Of those, 690 were downtown and 6,571 were outside downtown. All are rental units. The majority are apartments located in both newly-constructed buildings and existing buildings, including offices, manufacturing space, warehouses and vacant schools that have been redeveloped into apartments, said Martha Brown, deputy DCD commissioner, in an email. The total also includes several hundred new single-family homes, and both one- and two-family vacant houses that have been completely rehabilitated and made available as affordable rental housing. Milwaukee housing changes Map shows the change in the number of residential properties in each aldermanic district from 2004 to 2019. Design: Eric Litke, Milwaukee Journal SentinelSource: Wisconsin Elections Commission  According to Brown, the developments were financed with federal Low Income Housing Tax Credits allocated by the Wisconsin Housing and Economic Development Authority. Under the program units are deemed affordable based on a variety of factors, but cant go to anyone making more than 60% of the median income for the area. For a family of four, the cut-off would be $49,380. In many cases, the apartments are earmarked for those making an even smaller percentage of the median income. Brown also noted that Habitat for Humanity develops affordable housing for homeownership and those units were not included in DCDs count. Brian Sonderman, executive director of Habitat for Humanity Milwaukee, said since 1984 the group has built or rehabbed 620 single-family homes and has assisted more than 700 additional families through affordable home repair and loan assistance. We believe affordable homeownership is key to helping local families build strength, stability and independence, Sonderman said in an email. Sonderman said the city has helped the process with acquisition as well as funding. For instance, the city may sell vacant lots to the group for $1 each. Habitat also receives federal grant money allocated through the city. So, by the numbers, Barrett is on target. Is there anything else to consider? Residential vs. apartments According to the city Assessors Office, the count of residential properties as reported on the citys 2004 Statement of Assessment (the year Barrett was elected) was 135,352. The number from 2019 showed 137,098 parcels. But that figure accounts for only residential housing and condos, not the apartments that are the focus of the tax credit program. In August 2019, Mike Ruzicka, president of the Greater Milwaukee Association of Realtors, sent a letter to community leaders in Milwaukee, Ozaukee, Washington and Waukesha counties urging officials to think twice before approving more apartment projects. Greater Milwaukee is following a trend seen across the country, he wrote. Numerous multifamily units are being built at the expense of owner-occupied condominium and single-family units. Indeed, at the same time the city has been adding affordable housing units, it has been busy bulldozing derelict ones. Between April 1, 2004 and Oct. 31, 2019, some 3,542 units were razed by the city, and 3,123 razed privately, for a total of 6,665 units razed, according to the city Department of Neighborhood Services. These are not places where people live; and in many instances, removal of these blighted structures spurs additional neighborhood revitalization and growth, said Christina Klose, a department spokeswoman. Our ruling Barrett said since he took office, the city has seen the creation of 7,000 new affordable housing units. The numbers back him up: Through affordable housing programs, 7,261 units have been created since Barrett took office."
18754,true,Tim Kaine,"Says when he was governor,we expanded participation in Virginia in early childhood programs by nearly 40 percent.","Democratic Senate hopeful Tim Kaine says a key step in building a workforce trained for the future is to ensure all children are prepared to enter kindergarten. And he offers his record as governor as proof of his commitment to that goal.The research clearly demonstrates high-quality early childhood opportunities help children succeed, he wrote in a paper laying out his economic policies. Thats why we expanded participation in Virginia in early childhood programs by nearly 40 percent...We checked whether Virginias early childhood programs really did grow by 40 percent during Kaines term as governor from 2006 to 2010.During his gubernatorial campaign, Kaine proposed making Virginias pre-kindergarten program available to all 4-year-olds -- not just those from families living close to the poverty line. The universal access was estimated to cost $300 million a year.Once in office, Kaine scaled back that ambition in the face of a recession that eroded state revenues. But he did seek increases preschool programs every year during his term.Budget records show he proposed an extra $4.6 million for the 2007-08 fiscal year to add 1,250 children to the program. In his full biennial budget, which covered 2008 through 2010, Kaine sought $56 million in additional funding, according to reports. The request was pared to $40 million, then $22 million, as lawmakers sought to cope with the recession.Over the course of Kaines term, the Virginia Preschool Initiative saw a steady rise to its annual budget from $46.3 to $58.6 million. (That trend has continued into the recently approved budget, which provided $68.2 million for 2013 and $68.5 million for 2014.)Virginia Preschool Initiative teaches social and learning skills to 4-year-olds who will become eligible for free or reduced lunch programs when they enter public schools. The pre-K program is open to at-risk children who live above the poverty line. Children below that line qualify for the federal Head Start program.In the 2005-06 school year, when Kaine took office, 11,343 children were enrolled in Virginias preschool initiative. By the time his term ended, in the 2009-10 school year, the program had 15,901 children. The increase is 40.2 percent.Our rulingKaine claimed that he was part of expanding participation in early childhood programs in Virginia by nearly 40 percent. The numbers confirm that."
8020,true,Jennifer McClellan,More than half of Virginias school buildings are older than 50 years.,"State Sen. Jennifer McClellan, D-Richmond, is leading a bipartisan effort this winter to raise money to repair and replace Virginias aging school buildings. Studies have shown more than half of Virginias school buildings are older than 50 years, she and Sen. Bill Stanley, R-Franklin, wrote in a Feb. 15 guest column published in The Roanoke Times. We wondered whether the figure is correct, particularly in the wake of a Feb. 11 fire that gutted Richmonds 111-year-old William Fox Elementary School. An advisor to McClellan pointed us to a June 2021 report the Virginia Department of Education gave to a legislative commission studying the conditions of the states school buildings. More than half of all school buildings are greater than 50 years old, the report said, using almost the same words as the guest column. The report surveyed 2,005 school buildings across the state and found 1,017 of them - or 52% - were at least 50 years old as of June 2021. The median, or middle, age was 52. Here are percentages of local schools at least 50 years old: Chesterfield, 38%; Hanover, 48%; Henrico, 64%; Richmond, 72%. McClellan says the state and localities are falling behind on renovating and replacing old schools and, without change, the problem will worsen. Shes proposed a number of bills that would raise more money for modernization. The measures include: Allowing all localities in Virginia to impose a 1% increase in their sales tax, subject to voter approval, for school construction or renovation. Only nine localities are now granted that option; Letting local school systems set aside operating budget surpluses for school construction; Lowering the interest rates on state loans to localities for school construction and upgrades; and Expanding state aid for school building projects. Her bills easily passed in the Democratic-led Senate with bipartisan support. But identical measures have been killed in the Appropriations Committee of the Republican-led House. Its unclear whether there will be any movement in the House, where the majority has been focused on Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkins agenda of cutting taxes. We should finally note that problems with aging school buildings are not confined to Virginia. In June 2020, the U.S. Government and Accountability Office reported that about half of the nations public school districts need to replace multiple building systems or features. The average age of U.S. school buildings was 44 in 2013, according to the most recent survey by the National Center for Education Statistics. McClellan writes, More than half of Virginias school buildings are older than 50 years. State Department of Education records show 52% of Virginia schools had crossed the half-century mark in June 2021. "
2803,true,Jeff Merkley,"Says, Since 1994 when VAWA was first passed, incidents of domestic violence have dropped more than 50 percent.","Violence - or the potential for violence - is everywhere. Its the reason we have police and laws, jails and federal programs to study the causes and suggest responses.Its the reason, too, that Congress passes laws to address crime in all its facets. One of those is the Violence Against Women Act, which is intended to protect women from domestic abuse and violence. It provides federal dollars for an array of programs to achieve that goal. Oregon, for example, collected $9.4 million in 2012 for programs to protect women from violence.The law was first passed in 1994 and easily renewed in 2000 and 2005 by lopsided majorities. But it was allowed to lapse in 2011 after a partisan Congress couldnt reach agreement. (Partisanship in Congress? Shocking, we know.)Now its back and in an effort to build momentum and the votes to renew it, supporters like Sen. Jeff Merkley, D-Ore., have been talking about the laws benefits.Heres what Merkley said Feb. 7 during a conference call with reporters: Since 1994 when VAWA was first passed, incidents of domestic violence have dropped more than 50 percent.That seems to be a pretty strong selling point and as the bill moves toward a final vote in the Senate its something that will be repeated and emphasized during debate.But is it true?First, we need a quick fly-by of the law and what it provides. The law, known by the shorthand VAWA, first passed in 1994 and was written by then senator and now Vice President Joe Biden.It acknowledged domestic violence and sexual assault as crimes, and provided federal resources to encourage community-coordinated responses to combating violence. When it was re-authorized in 2000 lawmakers expanded the definition of crime to include dating violence and stalking. Its subsequent reauthorization in 2005 created new programs to meet the emerging needs of communities working to prevent violence.Until it expired in 2011, the law was expansive and reached into every corner of the country. (Some funding continued into 2012.) Among other things, it provided grants to states and local law enforcement to beef up enforcement as well as money to prosecutors to focus on gender-based crime. Included in the array of programs and assistance, VAWA provided money for direct services for victims of sexual assault and for things like transitional housing and legal assistance.According to Merkley, all those programs made a difference.Which brings us back to his claim that since it was first enacted domestic violence has fallen 50 percent.Another fortunate development when it comes to crime is that governments at all levels but especially the federal government go to great lengths to quantify, parse and sub-total crime. Data abounds.Its also unambiguous.From 1994 to 2010, the overall rate of intimate partner violence in the United States declined by 64 percent, from 9.8 victimizations per 1,000 persons age 12 or older to 3.6 per 1,000, the U.S. Justice Departments Bureau of Justice Statistics reported in November 2012.The report notes that over that same period 4 in 5 victims of intimate partner violence were female.A report by the National Network to End Domestic Violence, an interest group focusing on the issue, comes to a similar conclusion.The rate of nonfatal intimate partner violence against women has decreased by 63 percent and the number of women killed by an intimate partner has decreased 24 percent, between 1994 and 2010.The group connects the numbers directly to the VAWA, saying the law has changed the way federal, tribal, state and local entities respond to domestic violence, sexual assault, dating violence and stalking.Surveys by the American Bar Association and other independent groups had similar findings.Thats a lot of scholarship and paper, sponsored, collected and analyzed by federal and independent researchers. And while the results dont perfectly align, all agree that the incidence of domestic abuse has dropped by more than 50 percent since the Violence Against Women Act was passed in 1994. You can quibble about the minor differences but not the accuracy of Merkleys statement."
4040,true,John Ludlow,Says he is the only candidate in the race for Clackamas County Chair who will refuse to join the Public Employees Retirement System.,"Wilsonville businessman John Ludlow is in a four-way race for Clackamas County Commission Chair in next week's election. He says that he is the only candidate in the race who will refuse to join the Public Employees Retirement System.Is he the only candidate in the race to make such a promise? Perhaps just as important a question: Are elected officials even able to decline joining the retirement system?The Public Employees Retirement System is a hot-button issue with critics who claim it eats way too much money, hurting taxpayers to benefit public employees. The retirement program is open to participating employers, from the state of Oregon to school districts and cities.We turned to Paul Cleary, the retirement system's executive director. He pointed to Oregon Revised Statutes 238A.100 (2):  A person who is elected or appointed to an office with a fixed term ...may elect not to become a member of the pension program by giving the Public Employees Retirement Board written notice not later than 30 days after taking office. The trick here, says Cleary, is that for a person to decline membership, that person cannot have been a PERS member, ever. Ludlow is a former Wilsonville city councilor and served as Wilsonvilles mayor from 1989 to 1991, but received no retirement benefits from his time in public office.Ludlow, 63, says he has never been a member of PERS, and the Public Employees Retirement System confirms he is not a member.The other Clackamas County commission chair candidates are members of the Public Employees Retirement System. They are county Chairwoman Charlotte Lehan, county Commissioner Paul Savas, and state Rep. Dave Hunt. They cannot opt out. Savas said he never knew he could decline to join. He is the only candidate who will refuse, and who can refuse, to join PERS."
3753,true,Stand For Children Tennessee,Says that Tennessee law requires that schools receive half of proceeds -- $31 million per year -- from a half-cent increase in the Shelby County sales tax.,"Education funding issues often provoke emotional arguments, and a measure to increase the local option sales tax in Shelby County by a half cent has led to accusations that an education-advocacy group is trying to manipulate voter sensibilities with misleading claims about the benefits for school-children.We've covered some education funding issues before, like the claim that the education burden on Tennessee and Shelby County taxpayers is among the lowest in the nation (Mostly True) and the assertion that local governments have not increased spending on schools over six budget cycles (True).In this case, Stand For Children is leading the campaign to persuade voters in Memphis and unincorporated Shelby County to raise the local option sales tax levied by the county from the current 2.25 percent to 2.75 percent (the state sales tax rate is 7.0). The overarching message on expensive, glossy mailers -- the future of the adorable children smiling in photos will be brighter if voters approve the half-cent sales tax increase.Stand is allied with a bi-partisan coalition of supporters, including Memphis Mayor A C Wharton and most of the Memphis City Council, Shelby County Commission chairman Mike Ritz, Memphis Congressman Steve Cohen and the majority of the unified Shelby County Board of Education. They argue the increase is necessary to help fund the $57 million shortfall that Shelby County's schools merger Transition Planning Commission says will occur if all their schools consolidation recommendations are approved by the unified county school board.Opponents, including Shelby County Mayor Mark Luttrell and Memphis City Councilman Jim Strickland, contend that until a clearer picture is available for the exact budget needs of the consolidating school systems in Memphis and Shelby County, it is premature to levy an additional tax.Stand is making a slew of claims, some of which elude the Truth-O-Meter process because they involve opinions, hypotheticals and interpretations about the will of elected officials. Small change can make a big difference for all of our kids reads one line, and another claims the revenue will make our schools better. Both are clearly opinions.Stand also says the money will allow for expansion of pre-kindergarten and training for teachers, while also possibly helping expand hours at libraries and community centers. Strickland especially objects to what he calls the pre-K promise, and indeed it remains to be seen whether the school board will follow through on the recommendations of the Transition Planning Commission and its own committees and staff to expand pre-K. There are budget and logistical issues that could delay or derail the plan to offer pre-K to all children who need it.Stand in some cases has adjusted, for instance, by qualifying its language on pre-K. But on one issue it has only raised the volume -- that whatever else is argued about increasing the county sales tax, $31 million is guaranteed to flow to the county's schools because state law requires half of the proceeds of a local option sales tax to be spent on schools.That's the claim we are examining here.When we contacted Stand, its Memphis-based state director, Kenya Bradshaw, almost immediately emailed back a copy of Tennessee Code Annotated 67-6-712, Distribution of revenue under the The 1963 Local Option Revenue Act.Bradshaw was a member of the county Transition Planning Commission that made pre-K for all who need it one of its highest priorities, and she carries around an actual copy of the statute.It deals with the local option sales tax and very plainly states that one-half (1/2) of the proceeds shall be expended and distributed in the same manner as the county property tax for school purposes is expended and distributed.It also says that the the proceeds can be pledged to the punctual payment of principal of and interest on bonds, notes or other evidence of indebtedness but doing so requires the approval of the local school board.Estimates of the revenue expected to be raised from that county sales tax increase have run between $60 million and $62 million -- it depends in part on projections of future economic activity. So $30-31 million per year would, in fact, be guaranteed for schools. The half that does not go to schools is returned to the municipalities where they were collected, and of that non-schools portion $23 million is expected to flow to Memphis.One core issue is that approval of the countywide increase would trump the votes in August referendums by suburban municipalities to apply a half-cent local option sales tax as a way to raise revenue to fund municipal school districts they hope to operate.Opposition to the increase in some suburban municipalities is therefore fierce, because it would mean lower overall revenue than was expected for some municipal school districts. Some opponents argue that the vote is basically an anti-suburban municipal schools money grab by Memphis interests. Residents in those suburbs do not get a vote because they already have authorized sales tax increases for their towns.Another argument by proponents is that a vote against the half-cent sales tax increase is essentially a vote for a property-tax increase to fund the expected budget gap created because of schools consolidation.Our rulingThere is clearly much for voters to consider on the referendum to increase by a half-cent the county's sales tax rate, and the contentiousness related to the Shelby County's reorganization of public schools has created some confusion for voters.On one of the most crucial issues, Stand For Children claims half the proceeds from the local option sales tax must go to schools. The statute is definitive and the claim is True."
13156,true,Jeb Bush,Too many tattoos on visible body parts keepsome applicants out of the military.,"Failing test scores aren'tthe only problem that has caused the military to reject applicants, says former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush. Another problemis, well, more colorful: tattoos. While talking about his push to improve public education at the Wall Street Journal CEO Council event Dec. 1, Bush pointed to problems the military has finding qualified applicants. Bush mentioned a video in which a military official talked about the challenge: In the video beforehand, Gen. Dempsey talked about a 25 percent pass rate. Now thats not just because of the test, thats also because of obesity, and too many tattoos, to be honest with you, on visible body parts for people that are trying to get into the military. But the pass rate for a high-school-level test to join the military is about 35 percent, I think, or 40 percent at best. These are abysmal numbers. PolitiFact has previously fact-checked claims about whether obesity and physical fitness have kept applicants out of the military (both true).But we hadnt explored the role of tattoos in filling the military ranks. We couldnt resist taking a look. Tattoo policies Each branch of the service sets their own rules about tattoos, but it was the Armys policy that has drawn the most ink recentlyfrom the media. In March 2014, the Army overhauled its appearance policy, which includes more than two pages of detailed rules about tattoo, branding and body mutilation. This led to a rush to get tattedso soldiers could be grandfathered in under the new rules. The Army has a detailed procedure for grandfathering that directs unit commanders to document each tattoo in an official memorandum. The Armys policy states that tattoos, regardless of subject matter, are prohibited on certain areas of the body, including the wrists, hands and fingers, as well as the head, face, and neck, defined as anything above the t-shirt neck line to include on/inside the eyelids, mouth, and ears. Soldiers may have no more than four visible tattoos below the elbow (to the wrist bone) or below the knee, the policy says. So far under the new policy, 2,919 applicants could not process due to tattoos,said Brian Lepley, an Army recruiting spokesman. Those 2,919 are the ones whose tattoos were so egregious it was highly unlikely a waiver could get through, or the applicant chose not to try a waiver, he said. In the Army, 193 tattoo waivers for applicants have been granted, while one was rejected and four are pending. Lepley told us that tattoos are not the No. 1 disqualifier. Medical conditions, drug use, misconduct or some combination of those issues disqualify more applicants. News reports around the country indicate the tattoopolicy is limiting applicants, though. Right now, with the new tattoo policy in effect, we currently turn away one in every five applicants that come through our door, U.S. Army Captain Joshua Jacquez told CNN in a report from El Paso. Maj. Gen. Allen W. Batschelet, head of Army recruiting at Fort Knox, told the Kansas City Starin August that the policy is, rather arbitrary, in some sense. However he said that you have to draw the line somewhere for the Army to present a professional image. As for waivers, Batschelet said,To be blunt, the higher quality of applicant you are, the more tolerance we'd probably have for seeking a waiver. If you came in to sign up today and were a neurosurgeon, I got to tell you I'd go a long way toward trying to get an exception if all you had was a disqualifying tattoo. The Air Force,Marines and Navy also have their own tattoo policies. All of them generally ban tattoos that are obscene, advocate discrimination or express offensive views. The Air Force policy has a seven-step measurement guide that contains math formulas in an attempt to prevent tattoos from covering more than 25 percent of an exposed body part. (Partial inches should be rounded up to the nearest inch, it says.) The Marines policy states that applicants with more than four tattoos must be administratively reviewed. The Navys policy is the least detailed --only 277 words -- though like the other services, it bans head tattoos. Our ruling Bush said that among the reasons applicants are rejected by the military -- in addition to being obese or not passing the test -- is that some have too many tattoos on visible body parts. Since the Army updated its tattoo policy earlier this year, 2,919 applicants could not proceed due to tattoos. Other branches of the service also have restrictions on types and locations of tattoos that keep some applicants out of the military."
14682,true,Catherine Hanaway,"As a former federal prosecutor, I prosecuted over 4,000 cases.","At the March 17 Republican gubernatorial debate in Columbia, candidate Catherine Hanaway told an audience that she prosecuted more than 4,000 cases during her tenure as the U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Missouri. Hanaway served as a federal prosecutor from July 20, 2005, through April 17, 2009, which means that she would have had to prosecute at least three cases a day on average to make that 4,000-case benchmark. That seemed like a lot of cases, so we looked at the record. Hanaways history in public life While many Missourians may know Hanaway as the first female speaker of the House in Missouri, she is also a decorated prosecutor whos worked in both the private and public sectors. In 2005, Hanaway left her position as speaker after being appointed U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Missouri by former President George W. Bush. In 2009, Hanaway resigned and joined the Ashcroft Law Firm, founded by former Missouri governor, senator and U.S. attorney general John Ashcroft. As a side note, in 2013, Missouri Lawyers Media listed Hanaway as the most expensive lawyer to hire in Missouri at a rate of upward to $793 an hour. Hanaway said at the time that most of the firms clients were large national and international companies, and our rates are reflective of that. Hanaway joined Husch Blackwells St. Louis office in 2013. Her federal prosecution history Will Scharf, Hanaways policy director, said as a U.S. attorney, Hanaway was directly responsible for federal prosecutions across half the state, signing every federal indictment initiating formal proceedings against criminals within the district, and supervising prosecutions as they progressed. Its unclear how many of these cases she prosecuted personally. She oversaw a staff of more than 100 people, as Hanaway makes clear on her campaign website. According to the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Missouris online Case Management/Electronic Case Files system, which tracks criminal case filings for the court, Hanaways office filed at least 5,430 cases during her stint as a federal prosecutor. That doesnt include cases inherited by Hanaway from her predecessors. So it could be argued that Hanaway actually dealt with even more than 5,430 cases. Scharf also noted in an email interview that Hanaway never claimed to be lead counsel or that she tried 4,000 cases, and that the notion that she could physically be there to prosecute 4,000 cases would be absurd, since 95 percent of criminal cases end in a guilty plea without a trial. That percentage of plea bargains is in line with a 2011 Bureau of Justice Statistics estimate. Our ruling Hanaway told an audience that she prosecuted over 4,000 cases during her time as the U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Missouri. Based on federal data, Hanaways office dealt with well over 4,000 cases and each case required her personal signature. Her words might suggest that she handled each case herself, but most listeners would understand that she ran a large office."
16557,true,Rick Perry,A record number of immigrants not from Mexico are being apprehended at the border.,"Questioning the flow of unaccompanied Central American children across the Texas-Mexico border, Gov. Rick Perry declared he has yet to hear from President Barack Obama or his administration to a 2012 letter urging attention to the matter. Perry went on to say on Fox & Friends June 17, 2014: We have record-high numbers of other than Mexicans being apprehended at the border. These are people that are coming from states like Syria that have substantial connections to terrorist regimes and terrorist operations. Both of those claims drew our interest, though for this story, were tackling only Perrys statement that a record number of immigrants not from Mexico are being apprehended at the border. Well check his reference to people coming from states like Syria in another article. The increased flow of children from Central American nations has attracted attention, in part, Douglas Massey, a Princeton University professor, suggested this month, because fewer Mexicans are being detained near the border than any year since 1971. An online U.S. Border Patrol chart shows about 265,000 Mexicans were caught near the border in the fiscal year that ran through September 2013. That was up 3,000 from the year before, according to the chart, but down at least 15,000 compared to any of the previous dozen years. News reports suggest multiple factors in this surge including a contrast: The Border Patrol routinely and quickly returns immigrants from Mexico across the Rio Grande; that's not an option for handling individuals from distant countries like El Salvador and Honduras. So, have non-Mexican detentions at the border reached a record level? To our inquiry, Perry spokeswoman Lucy Nashed said Perry drew his conclusion about a record being set from information provided by the Texas Department of Public Safety. We turned to the Border Patrol for numbers. The federal agency posted an online chart indicating its officers apprehended 153,055 people from countries other than Mexico in the fiscal year that ran through September 2013. Thats more than in any of the seven previous years. That chart shows, though, that 165,170 other than Mexicans were apprehended in fiscal 2005. The numbers include all Border Patrol regions, including the northern border with Canada and coastal boundaries. Every year, though, the vast majority of such apprehensions occur in the agencys Southwest Border region, running from San Diego to the tip of Texas. And what about the South Texas portions of the border that have received attention recently? The chart shows nearly 115,000 apprehensions from countries other than Mexico in the agencys Laredo and Rio Grande Valley sectors in fiscal 2013, which outpaced the previous high of 100,647 in fiscal 2005. Tighter focus: The 96,829 other than Mexico apprehensions in the Rio Grande Valley sector in 2013 was 21 percent greater than the sectors previous high (at least since fiscal 2000) of 79,854 such apprehensions in 2005. By telephone, a Del Rio-based Border Patrol spokesman, Dennis Smith, brought us up to speed on other than Mexico apprehensions from October 2013 through May 2014, or the first eight months of fiscal 2014. In that period, he said, there were 165,729 such apprehensions nationally, including 162,749 in the Southwest region, counting what would be a 15-year high of 122,071 (and counting) in the Rio Grande Valley sector. Separately, analyst Jessica Vaughan of the Center for Immigration Studies, a think tank focused on reduced immigration, emailed us its chart demonstrating a surge since early 2011 in other than Mexico apprehensions in the Rio Grande Valley sector:   We asked Smith if for historys sake, we should try to gauge apprehensions before 2000, the earliest year on the Border Patrols chart. Smith said there werent more such apprehensions any year before 2000. Our own brief look for older data led us to a Sept. 22, 2005, report by the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service indicating fewer people from countries other than Mexico were apprehended in 1997, 1998 and 1999. Finally: The number of unaccompanied children being picked up also has been record-setting, according to a June 4, 2014, New York Times news story. Since Oct. 1, a record 47,017 unaccompanied children have been apprehended at the southwest United States border, the story said, most traveling from Central America, part of a larger wave that includes some youngsters accompanied by their parents and some traveling alone. The story said that according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection, that 47,017 total is nearly twice as high as all of the last fiscal year (24,493 apprehensions), with four months yet to go in the current fiscal year. And, a June 5, 2014, Times news story said, an internal draft Homeland Security document projects unaccompanied-minor apprehensions rising to 90,000 in the current fiscal year, running through September 2014. Peter Boogaard, a Homeland Security spokesman, told the paper the draft document was not official policy and had not been finalized or circulated. Our ruling Perry said a record number of immigrants not from Mexico are being apprehended at the border. We didnt come up with apprehension figures for every year through history. But available figures show the Border Patrol apprehended more people from countries other than Mexico along the border through the first eight months of fiscal 2014 than it apprehended in any of the preceding 17 years.

14494,true,Athens Banner-Herald,"Between 1980 and 2010, water usage in Georgia dropped even as the states population grew.","The bad news regarding water in Georgia is legion. No major reservoir has been built since the 2007-2008 drought to insulate metro Atlanta from future water shortages. Water/sewer rates have gone up in several counties to cover everything from federally mandated upgrades to increased material costs. Then there is the so-called water war with Alabama and Florida, a multi-year battle of lawsuits over how to meet the water needs across the states. So it was a surprise to read the recent headline in the Athens Banner-Herald: Water use in Georgia declines, even as population grows. The trend, the May 10, 2015 story said, was a 30 percent drop in water usage in the three decades between 1980 and 2010, the last year that federal data was available. Suffice it to say the claim whet our appetite – we save wetting our whistle for after-hours – for the numbers and what might be going on. We reached out to the U.S. Geological Survey, which has a mandate to file a water usage report for the nation every five years. In concert with that work, the agency encourages states to conduct their own reports. Georgia has compiled a report every five years since 1975, in a bid to provide information about the precious resource in a state without a single natural lake. The 1980 report shows that year, Georgia sucked 6.7 billion gallons of water from Georgia rivers and aquifers every day. In 2010, it sipped 4.7 billion gallons every day. While the reports in that overall span show some increases – including a 21 percent jump in daily use during the 1990s – water usage has plunged 30 percent when looking at the three decades. Census figures show the number of people living in Georgia over that period exploded, from 5.46 million in 1980 to 9.69 million in 2010. Thats a 77 percent increase. Given the well-known water woes in the Peach State, how is that possible? Conservation plays some role, which we will get into in a moment. But the biggest factor was the change in how thermoelectric plants across the state operated. Several of the facilities were decommissioned between 2000 and 2010 – during the worst of the drought years and the decade that saw usage plunge nearly 28 percent, said Steve Lawrence, a hydrologist with the USGS in Atlanta. Several other plants converted from coal-fired, which needs plenty of water to cool it as an energy source, to natural gas, Lawrence said. Thermoelectric withdrawals account typically for a third of withdrawals, so all water withdrawals decrease when such a large user drops its share, Lawrence said. Data is not available for 1980 for the per capita usage in Georgia. But 1985 and 2010 figures mirror the overall trend. Every Georgian used about 860 gallons of water daily in 1985 but only 470 gallons daily in 2010, Lawrence said. Those totals include a persons share of water that a utility, say Georgia Power, uses to provide electricity. Its unclear what the per person usage would be in 1985, if the water used by agriculture, industry and utilities are removed. But in 2010, it was an estimated 75 gallons a day per person to bathe, cook and clean, Lawrence said. Thats a good number, one you see with the push for water-efficient fixtures and conservation efforts like tiered pricing, Lawrence said. Local water providers, however, dont always follow the statewide trend. The Cobb County Water System can provide daily usage dating back to 1986, when the then-small county used just 38.6 million gallons countywide. In 1990, when the county had about 451,000 people, average daily use was 42.5 million gallons countywide. In 2010, about 688,000 people lived in Cobb, and daily usage was 57.1 million gallons for the county. Thats a 53 percent jump in population, and a 34 percent increase in daily usage. Although the daily usage did not keep pace with the population increase, the jump itself bucks the state trend. However, water system officials point out that Cobb saw usage drop 14 percent countywide between 2006 and 2014, during the worst of the recent droughts. The 2014 daily usage, of 104 gallons per person, also is down 15 percent from the 122 gallons per person in 2005, when the county began looking at per capita usage. You can see very clearly the impact of our water conservation efforts, which became much more aggressive in 2008, county spokeswoman AikWah Leow said. Our ruling News reports claimed that Georgia has seen its water usage drop over the past three decades, in the same period that the population mushroomed. Federal reports confirm that unlikely shift, largely due to a change from coal-fired electric plants to facilities powered by natural gas. Conservation efforts also have made an impact, even if local water systems dont show quite the same drop in usage. But the statewide trend is clear."
1867,true,Tom Graves,America's wealthiest 25 percent pay 86 percent of total income taxes. Wealthiest 5 percent pay 60 percent of total income taxes.,"Some of you may have come to work bleary-eyed Tuesday and angry at Uncle Sam.You procrastinators waited untl the last minute to file your income taxes, which were due by midnight Monday.In honor of the tax deadline, Tom Graves, a congressman from northwest Georgia, began sending out messages last week about the current tax system. One message, posted on his Twitter page, caught our attention.America's wealthiest 25 percent pay 86 percent of total income taxes. Wealthiest 5 percent pay 60 percent of total income taxes, the message said.If youre part of either of those income classes, you may be really upset now. Thats the point most fiscal conservatives are making as President Barack Obama proposes ending tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans as part of his debt reduction plan.This is not because we begrudge those whove done well -– we rightly celebrate their success, Obama explained in a recent speech. Instead, its a basic reflection of our belief that those whove benefited most from our way of life can afford to give back a little bit more.The top 5 percent have an annual adjusted income before taxes of about $160,000 or more. The top 25 percent have an annual adjusted income before taxes of about $67,000 or more.Instead of trying to figure whos right about whether the rich pay their fair share in taxes, we wanted to know whether Graves facts were correct.Our friends at the PolitiFact national site found that U.S. Rep. Michele Bachmann, R-Minn., slipped up while talking about the subject in a recent television interview on Today.Bachmann, who is considering a run for president, said, The top 1 percent of income earners pay about 40 percent of all taxes into the federal government. The top 1 percent of income earners (people making more than $380,000 a year before taxes) did in fact pay 39.5 percent of individual income taxes in 2007, but they paid 28 percent of all federal taxes in 2007.Thats a meaningful distinction because, as a general rule, the burden of the income tax is tilted heavily toward the upper end of the income spectrum, while the payroll tax burden -- another major federal tax -- is paid somewhat more evenly by poor and rich alike. PolitiFact rated Bachmanns claim False.Graves, by contrast, avoided Bachmanns linguistic error. His spokesman, John Donnelly, directed us to a report by the Internal Revenue Service that was completed this past winter, based on 2008 data. The report shows that the top 5 percent of taxpayers paid 58.7 percent of federal income taxes. The top 25 percent of taxpayers paid 86.34 percent of total income taxes.The National Taxpayers Union keeps a chart of such data on its website, and its spokesman said Graves math is accurate. The group supports the Republican proposals to cut the federal debt, which includes spending cuts to entitlement programs such as Medicare and no tax increases.The [tax] burden is inordinately high on the top 50 percent of income earners, spokesman Doug Kellogg said.Eric Toder, a veteran tax expert at the centrist to liberal Urban Institute, said his organization analyzed income tax rates for 2010 and also found similar numbers to what Graves put on Twitter. Toder noted that the current annual income cap on Social Security is $106,800, which is less than what the top 5 percent of earners pay. Obama said Tuesday that he wants to raise the income cap on Social Security.Graves was off by a percentage point in relaying the figure for the top 5 percent, but both of his numbers are very close to the IRS data. And while using only the federal income tax as a stand-in for the total federal tax burden paints a somewhat skewed picture, Graves was careful to make his words in the tweet accurate."
13823,true,Rachel Maddow,The overall fact about illegal immigration is that it's not actually getting worse.,"After criticizing conservative blogs and Republican lawmakers for perpetuating false facts, Rachel Maddow made an interesting claim on her show on Monday, August 2, 2010.Maddow said that Republicans consistently distort immigration issues to stir up their base during an election cycle.Illegal immigration always has to be refashioned into a crisis for every electoral cycle that Republicans want to use it, said Maddow. The overall fact about illegal immigration is that it's not actually getting worse. Maddow then showed a graph of apprehension rates of illegal immigrants from 1978 to 2008 that showed that the rate in 2008 was the lowest in years. We were curious to see if Maddow was right in saying that illegal immigration is not getting worse.The graph that Maddow displayed on the show was from a fact sheet published by the Department of Homeland Security. The graph displays border apprehensions by year. There is no way to know exactly how many people illegally cross the U.S. border every year, but apprehensions seem to be an indicator of inflows of undocumented Mexicans crossing the border illegally, according to Jeff Passel, a senior demographer for the Pew Hispanic Center.According to the DHS fact sheet, the number of apprehensions made by the Border Patrol declined for the third year in a row to 724,000 in 2008 after reaching a mid-decade peak of 1,189,000 in 2005.However, some immigration experts do not consider apprehension rates to be particularly useful. Although the apprehension rate is usually a good indicator of trends, it is not exact, according to Bryan Griffith, a spokesman for the Center for Immigration Studies, a think tank in favor of increased border enforcement. Just because the apprehension rate is down, doesn't mean less people are trying to come. It could mean they're getting better at not getting caught. Maddow decided to use apprehension statistics to make her point about illegal immigration. However, illegal immigration is about more than illegal border crossings. Focusing on the number of people crossing the border alone is just inaccurate, said Jim Carafano of the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank. Apprehension rates are useful, but don't tell you the whole story. For instance, it is estimated that as many as 40 percent of illegal immigrants in the U.S. entered legally, but overstayed their visas.The whole story is better reflected in the total estimated population of illegal immigrants in the United States. Using monthly Census data, the Center for Immigration Studies estimated that the illegal population declined 13.7 percent (1.7 million) from a peak of 12.5 million in the summer of 2007 to 10.8 million in the first quarter of 2009. This is similar to DHS estimates, which also saw a downward trend from a peak of 11.8 million in 2007 to 10.8 million in 2009.Even though Maddow didn't use those statistics, they back up her claim. Illegal immigration is not increasing, and by at least two measurements, illegal immigration has actually gotten somewhat better. But don't herald the defeat of illegal immigration just yet.It's important to note that the decline in the number of undocumented workers sneaking across the border may have less to do with a more secure border and more to do with a less secure economy in the U.S. The DHS report speculates that the decrease in inflow may be due to declining U.S. economic growth and enhanced border enforcement efforts.Passel thinks it has more to do with the former than the latter. It's not that we're discouraging people, said Passel, It's because they know they can't get jobs because of the economic downturn. Passel said that his data shows that from 1992 through about 2004 the U.S. employment rate and the volume of the numbers of Mexicans coming to the U.S. are almost perfectly correlated. This seems to indicate that illegal immigration inflows are primarily related to economic considerations.It's both economic and enforcement, said Griffith.The more difficult you make the trip, the less people are going to attempt to make that trip.However, if the unemployment rate drops and more jobs are available, it's likely that more people will risk crossing the border, because the benefits are worth the risk, according Carafano. The test is whether the illegal immigrant population will continue to decline after the economy picks up.By two key measurements, the numbers of illegal immigrants crossing the border are not increasing. At least for the time being, the numbers in both counts are going down. But when the economy picks up again, it is possible that illegal immigration will once again increase."
17108,true,Michael Skindell,Says that in the recent year homeowners across Ohio have signed mineral rights agreements and I understand that over a billion dollars worth of leases have been signed to date.,"Ohio Gov. John Kasich has enthusiastically cheered the money-making prospects of hydraulic fracking, a technique used to extract oil and gas from underground shale.Eastern Ohio, with its energy-laden Utica and Marcellus shale formations, is high on the list of targeted areas where companies are looking buy up rights to drill for the lucrative resources below.But many have voiced environmental concerns over the process, which pumps millions of gallons of chemical-laced water and sand deep into horizontal wells under high pressure. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency is studying hydraulic frackings effects on drinking water. And New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, a Republican whose pugnacious and conservative style is often compared with Kasichs, last month ordered a one-year moratorium on the practice so more information can be gathered. Enter Ohio State Sen. Michael Skindell. Skindell, a Lakewood Democrat, this month introduced Senate Bill 213, which would institute a ban on hydraulic fracking until the EPA completes its study and lawmakers have time to digest it. A companion bill would require companies to disclose chemicals it uses when drilling. Both pieces legislation are aimed at what Skindell sees as a fracking bonanza. In the recent year, we have seen the oil and gas companies go to homeowners throughout Ohio and encourage them to sign leases and turn over mineral rights for this process, Skindell said during a Statehouse news conference to promote the two bills. And I understand that over a billion dollars worth of leases have been signed to date. That billion-dollar figure caught PolitiFact Ohios attention, given the relatively fledgling fracking market. True, reports across Ohio have pegged the Utica shale formations in eastern Ohio as a new frontier of sorts. But $1 billion? We went to Skindell to learn his source. Skindell shared with us a web link to a March story published by the Dayton Daily News. The newspaper focused on one company, Chesapeake Energy Corp. of Oklahoma City. Chesapeake, the article noted, has reportedly spent $1 billion acquiring leases in Ohio without drilling a producing well, a figure reported by the Wall Street Journal on March 7. By the time it left Skindells lips, it was a fact repeated at least third-hand. If it was a fact all. So off to the Wall Street Journal we went. The March 7 story attributed the $1 billion figure to Chesapeake. Journal reporter Ryan Dezember referred PolitiFact Ohio to earnings statements and other financial documents from the publicly held company. Mindful that the news at this point was 6 months old, Dezember theorized that the figure had likely grown. Sure enough, a transcript of a July 29 conference call between Chesapeake executives, investors and analysts and Chairman and Chief Executive Aubrey McClendon confirmed this. ... Weve spent between $1.5 billion and $2 billion acquiring leasehold in the Utica, said McClendon, referring to the shale in eastern Ohio. And of course, Chesapeake wouldnt have invested that amount if executives werent convinced the resources could yield much more. In a financial report issued the day before the conference call, Chesapeake noted that officials believed the Utica shale play could add between $15 billion and $20 billion in value. Chesapeake is not the only party interested in Ohio shale. Clif Little, an Ohio State University extension educator in Guernsey and Noble counties, said more than 1,200 property owners have taken his leasing farmland for oil and gas classes this year. Drilling companies, small oil and gas companies, landowner associations and attorneys all are attempting to secure deep drilling rights, Little added. The $1 billion figure is an old figure, Little wrote in an email. The amount invested in the Utica and Marcellus would far exceed that number today, but I am no longer keeping track of investment figures. Although he might not have been right on the money, Skindell was very much in the ballpark with respect to Chesapeakes figures. If anything, he undersold the political point he was trying to make: that Ohio is on the cusp of a fracking boom. Skindells words were over a billion dollars worth of leases, and clearly that is the case."
3815,true,Lena Taylor,Polling shows that nearly 74 percent of National Rifle Association members support requiring background checks for all gun sales.,"A bill that Gov. Scott Walker appears to favor would scrap a nearly 40-year-old Wisconsin law that requires a 48-hour waiting period for handgun purchases. Some opposition has emerged. In an unscientific poll on JSOnline, the website of the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, 70 percent of the more than 2,200 votes cast were for keeping the waiting period in place. The next day, March 12, 2015, state Sen. Lena Taylor expressed her opposition -- suggesting that even most members of the National Rifle Association, which fights restrictions on the right to bear handguns as well as long guns, would side with her against the bill. The Milwaukee Democrat issued a statement after the Republican-sponsored bill was approved by the Senate Judicial and Public Safety Committee in a 3-2 party-line vote. Not including background checks (of) all types of firearms, ignoring the public safety and the mental health needs of our state is downright irresponsible, said Taylor, who cast one of the no votes. Polling showed that even nearly 74 percent of NRA members support requiring background checks for all gun sales. Setting aside the fact Taylor is muddying the waters by implying a background check would go away -- it wont -- lets check her statistic on polling for NRA member support for such measures. Background checks Under federal law, states decide whether they want to process background checks to ensure that people who are prohibited by law from owning guns do not purchase one. In Wisconsin, the state Department of Justice does the checks for handguns, while the FBI does them for long guns. The states check of handgun purchasers includes a more extensive review of databases, such as those involving offenses committed by juveniles, than the FBI routinely does. The most recent state figures show that from July 1, 2013 through June 30, 2014, the state processed more than 196,000 background checks for handgun purchases. More than 99 percent of the applications were approved, including more than 29,000 that were approved instantly. The Department of Justice has said that on average, the background checks are done within four hours. The new legislation would not change the requirement for background checks. Supporters say that in most cases, since the checks are done quickly, there is no reason for people to have to wait 48 hours to take possession of the handgun theyre buying. Opponents worry about instances such as a couple getting in an argument and then running out to buy guns before they have a chance to cool off. The polling Now to what recent polling on background checks has found among the several million members of the politically powerful NRA. In March 2013, Lee Leffingwell, then the mayor of Austin, Texas, made a two-part claim that includes the claim Taylor made. He said 90 percent of Americans and 74 percent of NRA members support background checks of gun purchasers. PolitiFact Texas rated his claim True. The key evidence was an article published in the New England Journal of Medicine on a poll done in January 2013 by two entities at Johns Hopkins University -- the Department of Health Policy and Management and the Center for Gun Policy and Research. The poll was conducted online among 2,703 adults -- including 169 NRA members -- through GfK Knowledge Networks, which specializes in working with academic and government researchers to do polling online. It recruits participants randomly via mail and telephone. The poll found that 74 percent (to be precise, 73.7 percent) of NRA members supported requiring background checks for all gun sales. (The margin of error was seven points.) This poll was the most on point that we could find in terms of Taylors claim. But we would also note two others done around the same time that included information on NRA households -- in other words, the person responding to the survey or someone in that household was an NRA member at the time. A CBS News/New York Times poll, also from January 2013, found that background checks on all potential gun buyers were favored by 85 percent of NRA households. And a February 2013 poll by the Pew Research Center for the People and the Press found that 74 percent of people in NRA households favored making private gun sales and sales at gun shows subject to background checks.  The NRA did not respond to our requests about Taylors claim. But as an organization, it opposes universal background checks. Two days after Taylor issued her statement, the NRA urged its members to oppose newly introduced legislation in Congress that would extend background checks to cover gun transactions at gun shows, over the Internet and in other settings. The statement on the NRA website said the federal bill does not address the real problems of fixing the broken mental health system and prosecuting criminals. Further, criminals will never submit to such a system so it will never truly be universal.  Our rating Taylor said polling shows that nearly 74 percent of National Rifle Association members support requiring background checks for all gun sales. The most recent national poll of NRA members that we could find, done in January 2013 by Johns Hopkins University, found that 73.7 percent of the members supported requiring background checks for all gun sales. Update:After this item was published, NRA spokeswoman Jennifer Baker called us contending that the Johns Hopkins poll could not accurately survey NRA members because only the NRA has access to the list of current, dues-paying members. We are not adjusting our rating, as it is a common practice in polling to ask respondents to identify whether they are members of, for example, a political party or other group."
17534,true,Amy Klobuchar,We're now the No. 1 producer of oil in the world. We've surpassed Saudi Arabia.,"Considering the United States strength in energy production, the debate over building the Keystone XL pipeline has become a symbolic one, said Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn. On NBCs Meet the Presson Jan. 4, 2015, Sen. John Barrasso, R-Wyo., said the new Republican Congress first priority in 2015 will be to pass a bill approving construction of the oil pipeline, which would stretch from Canada to Steele City, Neb., where it would connect with an existing pipeline that goes to the coast of Texas. Klobuchar responded by saying the project has merit but that the decision to build the pipeline should rest with President Barack Obama, not Congress. She said the debate has become a symbolic one that ignores Americas healthy energy market. We're now the no. 1 producer of oil in the world, she said. We've surpassed Saudi Arabia. We decided to check out the data and see if in fact the United States is the worlds top oil producer. As it turns out, the United States passed over Saudi Arabia about two years ago. According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, which tracks global energy production and consumption statistics, the United States has produced more oil than Saudi Arabia since the fourth quarter of 2012. American oil production surpassed Russia in 2011. Heres a chart showing the trend from the Energy Information Administration:  In the third quarter of 2014 -- the most recent available data -- the United States produced 14.2 million barrels of oil per day; Saudi Arabia produced 11.7 million per day; and Russia produced 10.5 million per day. Together, thats about 40 percent of total global production. This production growth has contributed to the United States ability to produce more oil than it imports for the first time in about 20 years. The Energy Information Administration expects American production to continue to grow in 2015, despite recent lower crude oil prices. Total oil production figures include crude oil, natural gas liquids and other liquid energy products. On top of oil, the United States produces significantly more natural gas than Saudi Arabia. According to the Energy Information Administration, United States energy production is about evenly split between petroleum and natural gas. Saudi Arabia, on the other hand, primarily produces petroleum. The majority of the United States oil production growth is concentrated in four regions: Bakken, N.D., Eagle Ford, Texas, the Niobrara region in the Upper Midwest, and the Permian Basin of Texas and New Mexico. North Dakota and Texas together comprise almost 50 percent of all crude oil production in the United States -- compared to 2010, when the two states combined produced just 26 percent of all United States crude oil production. In 2013, energy markets consultant group PIRA Energy published a report that said shale production is one of the driving forces behind the countrys production growth. Shale oil and gas are commonly associated with hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, which is the process of using water pressure to fracture a rock to release natural gas and oil. The United States is the world leader in shale gas production. There is at least one piece of context to keep in mind when looking at the United States oil production compared to Saudi Arabia, noted Leonardo Maugeri, an associate at Harvard Universitys Geopolitics of Energy project. Saudi Arabia has a higher capacity than the United States to produce oil, but it chooses not to use it all -- so as not to inundate the global oil market. In other words, if Saudi Arabia produced at full capacity -- as the U.S. does -- its production would be higher than the U.S., Maugeri said. Our ruling Klobuchar said the United States is now the No. 1 producer of oil in the world. The latest global oil production statistics back up Klobuchars claim. The United States has been the worlds largest oil producer since late 2012. Helpfund PolitiFact's Kickstarter to live fact-check the 2015 State of the Union and GOP response."
9135,true,Nancy Pelosi,The House of Representatives has never sued a sitting president in all of U.S. history.,"The U.S. House of Representatives recently voted to sue President Barack Obama for allegedly overstepping the powers of his office. While the suit raises thorny legal questions about the limits of presidential power, its also being used by both sides to fire up their base in advance of the midterm elections. The suit, spearheaded by House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, was approved largely along party lines. Democrats argued that its an example of the Republican majority playing politics rather than tackling urgent policy issues, such as immigration. Indeed, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., used the looming vote to approve the suit in a recent fundraising pitch, as reported by NBC News. Boehner is planning a vote to sue the president, Pelosi wrote. The House of Representatives has never sued a sitting president in all of U.S. history. And if they do it, impeachment may very well be the next step. We wondered whether Pelosi is correct that the House of Representatives has never sued a sitting president in all of U.S. history. We found that shes right the House as a whole has never sued the president. However, we think its worth noting that individual lawmakers and groups of lawmakers have sued the president in the past -- frequently. In fact, we found at least 14 instances in the last four decades alone. This doesnt make Pelosis carefully worded claim inaccurate, but it's worth adding important context. We should note that these challenges to presidential authority generally failed, particularly challenges over whether Congress or the president has the right to initiate military action. Often, the suits Achilles heel was the courts determination that the lawmakers lacked the standing -- basically, a demonstrable injury -- to file such a suit. This succession of negative rulings for Congress has presented the plaintiffs against Obama with an uphill legal climb, analysts say. Heres a rundown of the 14 lawsuits we found: • Senate Select Committee on Presidential Campaign Activities vs. Nixon (1974). This was one of the Watergate-era cases involving what evidence President Richard Nixon had to turn over to investigators that heightened the pressure on Nixon to resign. • Drummond vs. Bunker (1977). William R. Drummond, a citizen of the Panama Canal Zone, sued President Jimmy Carter to stop his administration from negotiating about handing over the then-U.S.-held canal zone to Panama, arguing that only Congress possessed that right. Six members of Congress intervened in the case alongside Drummond, arguing that the executive branch was depriving them of their constitutionally protected vote. • Goldwater vs. Carter (1979). Several lawmakers, led by Sen. Barry Goldwater, R-Ariz., sued Carter, arguing that the president had bypassed Congress by ending a defense pact with Taiwan. • Crockett vs. Reagan (1982). Sixteen senators and 13 House members asked a federal court to rule that the dispatching of several dozen U.S. military personnel to El Salvador by President Ronald Reagan contradicted Congresss war powers and the Foreign Assistance Act. • Sanchez-Espinoza vs. Reagan (1983). Twelve House members joined with 12 Nicaraguan citizens and two American citizens seeking damages and a declaration that Reagan had violated war powers restrictions by pursuing the overthrow of the Nicaraguan government. • Conyers vs. Reagan (1984). Eleven House members sued Reagan, arguing that his use of military force in Grenada had usurped Congresss war powers. • Lowry vs. Reagan (1987). Ten House members sued Reagan on war powers grounds, this time over the presidents approval of escort operations for reflagged Kuwaiti tankers in the Persian Gulf. • Dellums vs. Bush (1990). One senator and 53 House members sued President George H.W. Bush to stop him from attacking Iraq without approval from Congress during the run-up to what became the Persian Gulf War. • Raines vs. Byrd (1997). Six members of Congress who had voted against giving the president the authority to veto individual items in bills -- rather than just entire bills -- sued over the acts constitutionality. • Chenoweth vs. Clinton (1999). Four House members sued President Bill Clinton over his creation by executive order of the American Heritage Rivers Initiative, saying it exceeded his authority as president. • Campbell vs. Clinton (2000). Thirty-one members of Congress sued Clinton on war powers grounds for his decision to send military forces to participate in a NATO-organized campaign of airstrikes in the former Yugoslavia. • Kucinich vs. Bush (2002). Rep. Dennis Kucinich, D-Ohio, sued President George W. Bush over the administrations unilateral withdrawal from an anti-ballistic missile treaty, arguing that the executive branch could not do that without Congress consent. • Doe vs. Bush (2003). Twelve House members joined with several dozen servicemembers and their families to sue Bush on war-powers grounds, seeking to stop a United States-led invasion of Iraq. • Kucinich vs. Obama (2011). Kucinich also sued Bushs successor, Obama, on war-powers grounds, saying that his intervention in Libya was unconstitutional. Drew Hammill, a spokesman Pelosi, said her statement is accurate because she is clearly referring to the House of Representatives, not individual members of Congress. Kermit Roosevelt, a law professor at the University of Pennsylvania, agreed that Pelosi has some justification for singling out a lawsuit by the whole House. Having a majority of the House on board suggests the grievance may be more legitimate, Roosevelt said, though he added that this scenario also suggests that the House should be able to use the powers the Constitution gives it -- our familiar system of checks and balances -- rather than trying to enlist the judiciary in a political struggle. Still, while Pelosis claim is literally accurate, legal observers suggested that her careful wording selectively downplays a long history of clashes between the two branches of government. Elizabeth Slattery, a legal fellow with the conservative Heritage Foundation, agreed, saying that Pelosis statement is technically accurate, but misleading Typically, suits are brought against other executive branch officials, rather than the president directly, she said. Stan Brand, a veteran Washington attorney who served as general counsel to the U.S. House under the late Speaker Thomas P. Tip O'Neill, D-Mass., said,It may be that the House as an institution has never sued a president, but undoubtedly there have been cases where challenges to presidential actions have occurred. I am not impressed by the claim that this is the first such suit, because it elevates form over substance. The much more interesting issues for me are the jurisprudential separation-of-powers implications of such litigation. Our ruling Pelosi said the House of Representatives has never sued a sitting president in all of U.S. history.We did find a long record of skirmishing between the legislative and executive branches over the limits of each branchs power, including at least 14 suits over the past four decades filed by individual lawmakers or groups of lawmakers. But Pelosi said the House of Representatives, and in her narrowly crafted claim, shes right."
21043,true,John Fleming,"In Massachusetts, half of the primary care doctors are not accepting new patients.","As the fallout from President Barack Obamas health care law takes center stage, some critics are raising concerns about how much access Americans will have to insurance and physicians in the future. On CNNs State of the Union, Rep. John Fleming, R-La., a physician and a critic of Obamacare, and Ezekiel Emanuel, a health policy specialist at the University of Pennsylvania who supports the law, faced off. At one point, they debated the situation in Massachusetts, where a law similar to Obamacare was signed in 2006. As evidence that the federal law wont work, Fleming said that in Massachusetts, half of the primary care doctors are not accepting new patients. His point was that even if you have insurance, you wont necessarily be able to see a doctor. We decided to check Flemings statistic to see if its correct. The statistic comes from an annual survey by the Massachusetts Medical Society, a professional association founded in 1781 that, among other things, publishes the prestigious New England Journal of Medicine. The 2013 edition of the societys Patient Access to Care survey -- which was based on 1,137 phone interviews with Massachusetts physicians -- found that 51 percent of family medicine practitioners in the state were accepting new patients. As Fleming indicated, almost exactly half are not. We will point out a few caveats, none of which seriously undercut Flemings claim. • While family medicine is certainly one type of primary care doctor, there are others. One type, internal medicine doctors, had a lower percentage (45 percent) accepting new patients, but another, pediatricians, had a higher percentage (70 percent). • There is substantial regional variation even within Massachusetts. The largest county in the state, Middlesex, had more doctors accepting new patients, at rates five to eight percentage points higher than the state as a whole. Other counties, such as Suffolk, had rates well below the state average. • Your likelihood of being accepted as a new patient depends heavily on what kind of insurance you have. Family medicine doctors accept 90 percent of new Medicare patients and 70 percent of patients with MassHealth, the states vehicle for Medicaid and Childrens Health Insurance Program. The 2013 survey did not look at new-patient acceptance rates for those who had private insurance or for patients with Commonwealth Care or Commonwealth Choice, the programs created under the 2006 law to insure those who previously had no insurance. However, data from the societys 2011 survey does show a danger sign for those worried that doctors will be unwilling to take patients newly insured by the national health care law. The 2011 survey found that family medicine physicians were significantly less likely to accept new patients with Commonwealth Care or Commonwealth Choice -- 56 percent and 44 percent, respectively -- than they were new Medicare and Medicaid patients. Equally striking, the survey found, the percentage of family doctors taking new patients with any type of insurance has fallen since 2007 from 70 percent to 51 percent. That said, determining whether Massachusetts is out of line on any of these benchmarks is tricky, since comparable data for other states is virtually nonexistent, and the available national data is calculated differently and is several years old. Our ruling Fleming said that in Massachusetts, half of the primary care doctors are not accepting new patients. That number is supported by a credible annual survey of Massachusetts doctors. While this doesnt necessarily mean the same thing will happen on the national level, the statistic is solid."
11648,true,Barack Obama,"The Border Patrol has 20,000 agents – more than twice as many as there were in 2004.","In a speech on immigration reform in El Paso, Texas, President Barack Obama boasted about an unprecedented number of border security agents along the U.S. border with Mexico, but he said critics probably still won't be satisfied.Under Secretary Napolitanos leadership, we have strengthened border security beyond what many believed was possible, Obama said in his May 10, 2011, speech. They wanted more agents on the border. Well, we now have more boots on the ground on the southwest border than at any time in our history. The Border Patrol has 20,000 agents –- more than twice as many as there were in 2004, a buildup that began under President Bush and that we have continued.Obama said that commitment is beyond what was requested by some Republicans who said they supported broader reform as long as we got serious about enforcement.I suspect there will be those who will try to move the goal posts one more time, Obama said. Theyll say we need to triple the border patrol. Or quadruple the border patrol.Obama has touted this statistic about border patrol agents in his immigration speeches before. In July 2010, we fact-checked the president's claim that Today, we have more boots on the ground near the southwest border than at any time in our history. (the same phrase he used in El Paso). And last month, our colleagues at PolitiFact Georgia checked Obama's claim in a TV interview that We have now more Border Patrol officers  than weve had at any time in our history.S.-Mexico border in 1916 to quell a surprise attack in the New Mexico town of Columbus by Pancho Villa, a military venture otherwise known as the Mexican Expedition of 1916.Here, we decided to focus on Obama's claim that the Border Patrol has 20,000 agents -- more than twice as many as there were in 2004.There were 20,745 border patrol agents as of April 9, 2011; 17,659 of them stationed along the southwest border with Mexico, according to data provided by Steven Cribby, a spokesman for the Department of Homeland Security.That's up from 17,499 border patrol agents at the end of September 2008, four months before Obama took office (an 18 percent increase).Singling out just the border patrol agents along the U.S.-Mexico border, the number has increased from 15,422 to 17,659 (a 14 percent increase).According to a March 3, 2010, analysis of border security by the Congressional Research Service, Border Patrol agent manpower assigned to the southwest border has been increasing steadily since the early 1990s. In 1992, there were 3,555 agents assigned to the southern border, by 2000 that number had increased by 141 percent to 8,580. Since 2000, the number of agents assigned to the southern border has continued to increase, more than doubling once more to 20,119 agents at the end of FY2009. The rapid and steady increase of Border Patrol agents assigned to the southern border reflects the ongoing interest in Congress in stemming the tide of illegal immigration.The report notes that Obama's proposed 2011 budget requested a reduction of 181 Border Patrol agents. But the administration's proposed 2012 budget calls for increasing the the number of border patrol agents to 21,370.Jack Martin, special projects director at the Federation for American Immigration Reform, which supports stricter illegal immigration guidelines, said Obama's statistic is true but that much of the credit for starting the trend toward more border security goes to Obama's predecessor.There has been a steady buildup of BP officers for several years given impetus by the 9/11 attacks, Martin said. The increase has by necessity been gradual because it is limited by the capacity of the BP training facility. In March 2011, the U.S. Government Accountability Office released a report, Border Security: DHS Progress and Challenges in Securing the U.S. Southwest and Northern Borders, in conjunction with testimony from GAO Director Richard Stana.The report confirmed that personnel and other resources to stop illegal crossings of the U.S.-Mexico border have increased dramatically in recent years. In 2004, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security was created, reorganizing several federal agencies under a single roof. That year, the agency had 10,500 agents to patrol land borders. That number now stands at nearly 21,000. In other words, manpower has roughly doubled since 2004, as Obama said in his speech in El Paso. Again, that trend began under President Bush, whom Obama credited, but it continued under Obama."
16430,true,Silvestre Reyes,Says Beto ORourke has a criminal record that includes DWI and burglary arrests.,"Democratic U.S. Senate candidate Beto ORourke of Texas has said that in younger days he was twice arrested in his hometown of El Paso--once, he says, for leaping a campus fence and the other time for driving while intoxicated. Readers have asked us whether the third-term congressman challenging Republican Sen. Ted Cruz has a criminal history. We decided to fact-check mention of the arrests in a 2012 TV ad that also was screenshot for an April 2017 Texas Tribune news story. In the ad, sponsored by then-U.S. Rep. Silvestre Reyes, D-El Paso, text next to what looks like ORourkes mugshot states that the facts are that ORourke has a criminal record including burglary and DWI. The ads narrator says ORourke has a criminal record that includes DWI and burglary arrests. That he does, we confirmed, which hes acknowledged since his first run for office. We tried to phone and email Reyes about his claim and failed to connect. Next, we attempted to get our own fix on the facts by seekingdocumentation of the DWI arrest through a public information request to the El Paso Police Department. Martin Rodriguez, a department records specialist, said by email the agency had no responsive records. We similarly queried the University of Texas at El Paso about the earlierarrest and didnt immediately hear back. A background check Separately, weran a background check of ORourke using the LexisNexis service. According to the results, ORourkes May 1995 misdemeanor arrest on the UTEP campus was later declined and his September 1998 misdemeanor DWI arrest in El Paso was dismissed. The check gave uscase numbers for the arrestsenabling us to fetch an El Paso County record stating that ORourke was initially arrested in May 1995 and that case was disposed of in February 1996. We saw too that after the DWI arrest, according to another county record, ORourke was referred to a misdemeanor diversion program in March 1999 and completedDWI school in May 1999. That documents last entry, dated Oct. 20, 1999, says: Misdemeanor diversion completed successfully. Campaign: ORourke often confirms arrests When we soughtdetail from ORourkes spokesman, Chris Evans, he said by email thatORourke had consistently addressed his arrests, notably during campaign stops inParis, Sunnyside, San Antonio and Houston, where ORourke told a group in August 2018 that he spent a night in the El Paso County jail after what he referred to as his 1995 arrest for criminal trespass. In San Antonio, a residenttold ORourke shed seen what someone described as his mugshot. ORourke replied: More than 20 years ago, I was arrested--not once, but twice. So you should know that and we should all own that, if asked. ORourke specified that hed been arrested for attempting to hop a fence at the University of Texas at El Paso and later, he said, for a far more serious mistake: I drove under the influence of alcohol. Theres no justifying that. April 2005 news story The oldest published account of the arrests appears to be an April 2005 El Paso Times news story about ORourkes successful run for a seat on the El Paso City Council. The story, which we found by searching the Nexis news database, quoted the incumbent, Anthony Cobos, stressing ORourkes DWI arrest. Cobos, who later served as county judge before being convicted on embezzlement charges, said at the time: I think you lead by example and his example speaks for itself. According to the story, O'Rourke was arrested on a DWI charge in September 1998 that was dismissed in 1999 after he completed a court-recommended DWI program. I've been open about that since the very beginning. I have owned up to it and I have taken responsibility for it, ORourke told the paper. The Times further reported that court records showed that ORourke earlier was arrested in 1995 at UTEP on a burglary of building charge, which was later dropped. ORourke told the paper: That happened while I was in college. I along with some friends were horsing around, and we snuck under the fence at the UTEP physical plant and set off an alarm. We were arrested by UTEP police. ... UTEP decided not to press charges. We weren't intending to do any harm, he was quoted saying. ORourkes campaign later provided a photo of a document Evans described by email as the original UTEP police report on ORourkes arrest there. It says ORourke and two other students were arrested at the universitys Physical Plant under the burglary portion of the state penal code, section 30.02, for attempted forcible entry. Congressman Reyes TV ad Seven years later, then-Rep. Reyes unveiled his ad, which was still viewable online as of Aug. 22, 2018. A May 2012 Times news story on the ad quoted ORourke saying that he was driving an intoxicated friend home when he was arrested for DWI. The story said that according to police records, ORourke completed a diversion program and the charge was dismissed. In August 2017, more recently, ORourke described the arrests to an East Texas newspaper. The Palestine Herald-Press quoted him saying: Some 20 years ago, I was charged with driving under the influence and, during my college years, I jumped a fence at the University of Texas at El Paso which resulted in a burglary charge, O'Rourke said. I was not convicted of either. Both incidents were due to poor judgement and I have no excuse for my behavior then. However, since then, I have used my opportunities to serve my community and my state. I'm grateful for the second chance and believe that we all deserve second chances. Our ruling A 2012 Reyes TV ad still viewable online six years later said ORourke has a criminal record that includes DWI and burglary arrests. O'Rourke's comments andrecords indicate that UTEP police arrested O'Rourke in 1995 for burglary, a misdemeanor chargedisposed of the next year. In 1998, El Paso police arrested O'Rourke for DWI, a misdemeanor charge that was dismissed after he completed DWI school the next year.
