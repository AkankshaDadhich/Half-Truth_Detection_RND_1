I have a evidence and a claim statement I want you to give me the score the following:

Factual Accuracy (0 to 1):
How much of the statement is factually accurate? Is it based on truth, or is it distorted?
0 = Completely inaccurate, 1 = Fully accurate.

Deceptiveness (0 to 1):
How misleading is the statement? Does it misrepresent the facts?
0 = Not deceptive at all, 1 = Highly deceptive.

Coherence (0 to 1):
How well does the statement hold together logically? Is it clear and consistent?
0 = Incoherent, 1 = Highly coherent.

Baldwin claimed, "When I worked on the Affordable Care Act, I wrote the amendment that allows all young people to stay on their parents’ health insurance until they turn 26. Overnight, millions of young Americans got health care." 

Multiple sources do credit her with authoring the draft of that provision. 

And it did give millions of young Americans access to health insurance — though not quite as speedily as she contended.

Original Paragraph
Despite being an outsider, Taapsee Pannu has made her way up the success ladder in Bollywood with her brilliant performances in films like, ‘Pink’, ‘Manmarziyaan’, ‘Thappad’ and others. In an exclusive interview with ETimes, the actress opened up about ongoing debate on insider vs outsider and her journey in the film industry so far.“It is how you have seen it. There have been ups and downs. We keep having these endless debates about insider vs outsider but nobody really knows the solution to it and even if you do, it is not that it can be implemented because the choice of a film is a very subjective thing. You cannot say that just because that person is a star kid, he is the right choice for the film. You also cannot say an outsider would suit the film the best. If you do, the tables will turn. So this debate does not have a foolproof solution to it. It is about your conscience. It is about how true you are to the way of working.”Elaborating further, she added, “My journey has been a testament to the fact that I have been patient and hard working. It is also luck because I feel 70 percent of the time it is luck that gets you films. The remaining 30 percent is how you misuse that luck. Do not take the opportunities you get for granted. Being an outsider, you have to be really on your toes because you cannot let go of even a single opportunity because you never know which opportunity will give a new direction to your career.”On the work front, Taapsee has some very interesting line-up of films in her kitty which include, ‘Rashmi Rocket’, ‘Loop Lapeta’, ‘Shabhash Mithu’ and ‘Haseen Dillruba’.






Final Score Calculation:

===============================
Original Paragraph:
(Reuters) - A gift-wrapped package addressed to U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin’s home in a posh Los Angeles neighborhood that was suspected of being a bomb was instead filled with horse manure, police told local media. The package was found Saturday evening in a next-door neighbor’s driveway in Bel Air, the Los Angeles Police Department told the Los Angeles Times and KNBC television, the NBC affiliate in Los Angeles. The package also included a Christmas card with negative comments about President Donald Trump and the new U.S. tax law signed by Trump last week. Reuters could not reach LAPD officials for comment on Sunday. An LAPD bomb squad X-rayed the package before opening it and found the horse manure inside, police told local media. Aerial footage from KNBC showed officers investigating a large box in wrapping paper, then dumping a large amount of what they later identified as the manure and opening the card that was included inside.  Mnuchin, who KNBC said was not home when the package was discovered, is a former Goldman Sachs Group Inc executive and Hollywood film financier. A road in Bel Air was closed for about two hours, KNBC reported. The U.S. Secret Service is also investigating the incident, according to the TV station.
