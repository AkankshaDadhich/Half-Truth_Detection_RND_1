""We now have historic low unemployment in America among all groups of people.""","Harris said, ""We now have historic low unemployment in America among all groups of people.""

Under the Biden-Harris administration, both the overall unemployment rate and the rates for several ethnic and racial groups have been relatively low by historical standards.

However, Harris said ""now,"" which ignores that the unemployment rate has trended upward for nearly two years. The unemployment rate for these groups currently ranges between six-tenths of a point to 2 percentage points above the record low for that group.",0.6,0.75,0.9,Half truth ,0.75,0.55,"0 to 0.2 - false
U.S. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg banned private drones from flying over areas affected by Hurricane Helene.,"X posts said Buttigieg banned private drones from flying over areas affected by Hurricane Helene.

But a Transportation Department spokesperson said the Federal Aviation Administration has not banned drones from providing Hurricane Helene disaster relief and recovery assistance. 

The Federal Aviation Administration on Oct. 2 issued a temporary flight restriction in limited parts of the areas Hurricane Helene affected, but lifted the restriction that night. 

A ban bars aircraft from flying over a specific area. A temporary flight restriction is temporary and usually applies to nonauthorized flights during emergency situations or special events. People who want to volunteer during emergency situations can coordinate with the authorities to have access to the restricted airspace",0.3,0.85,0.9,Mostly False,0.8,0.36,

Project 2025 would “cut” the Federal Emergency Management Agency and “kill federal-backed flood insurance.”,"Social media posts said Project 2025 would ""cut FEMA"" and ""kill federal-backed flood insurance.""  

Project 2025’s proposed FEMA changes include raising the per capita threshold for providing FEMA public assistance, terminating its grants, replacing the National Flood Insurance Program with privatized insurance and changing FEMA’s cost-share so that federal government covers less of the cost for smaller disaster response and recovery. 

Experts told PolitiFact that if these proposals became reality — surviving congressional opposition and overcoming what is likely to be limited private insurers’ support — they would reduce FEMA’s support to state and local governments, hinder disaster response and leave property owners with greater exposure and fewer options.",0.9,0.2,0.95,TRUE,0.85,0.97,
"When New Hampshire gubernatorial nominee Kelly Ayotte served on two companies’ boards, one “laid off 18,000 workers” and the other “laid off 1,200 American workers, moving jobs overseas.”
","A New Hampshire Democratic Party ad said that when Ayotte was serving on corporate boards, one company ""laid off 18,000 workers"" and another ""laid off 1,200 American workers, moving jobs overseas.""

Ayotte served on the company board of Blackstone, which had a joint venture with MGM Resorts when MGM laid off 18,000 workers as the  COVID-19 pandemic hit and travel slowed dramatically. But Blackstone served as MGM’s landlord; it did not operate the company or dictate its layoffs.

Another company for which Ayotte served as a board member, Caterpillar, laid off 1,200 U.S. workers during her tenure, and many of the jobs moved outside the United States. However, the ad ignores that Caterpillar’s U.S. employment increased overall by 8,600 jobs during Ayotte’s board tenure.",0.75,0.6,0.9,Half True,0.8,0.56,

Project 2025 has a few pages about NOAA and the National Weather Service and some of its phrasing is vague.

But it does call for major changes. It described NOAA as a primary component ""of the climate change alarm industry"" and said it ""should be broken up and downsized.""

FEMA “blocked a runway” at a South Carolina airport and “halted” hurricane relief flights.,"An Instagram video said that FEMA closed a runway at a Greenville, South Carolina, airport and halted flights of donated supplies to hurricane victims.

Organizers arranging the donations and flights said that flights were halted because enough donations had arrived to meet disaster needs for now. The decision did not involve FEMA. An airport spokesperson said a secondary runway was closed for three days for a FEMA contractor, but that closure didn’t affect flights in or out of the airport.

The ad distorted the timeline of Casey’s votes and blurred the difference between the Inflation Reduction Act and the American Rescue Plan. 

Casey was speaking about the Inflation Reduction Act in the clip shown in the ad. Inflation has fallen significantly since that law’s passage in August 2022, though economists believe the law was not a major reason why. 

However, Casey voted for the American Rescue Plan in 2021, which economists say contributed to the historically high inflation from 2021 to 2022. But that’s not the bill Casey said ""will reduce inflation.""

Gov. Tim Walz delivered paid family leave in Minnesota but “Republicans are blocking” a Biden-Harris proposal.","Buttitieg said Walz delivered paid family leave in Minnesota but ""Republicans are blocking"" a Biden-Harris proposal.

Walz signed a bill in May 2023 to provide for paid family leave. It takes effect in 2026.

Republicans, citing spending concerns, have broadly resisted federal paid family leave similar to the kind Walz signed into law. Trump failed to expand paid leave to all workers when he was president.

In 2021, Biden’s Build Back Better proposal, which included four weeks of paid family leave annually along with many other programs, failed to garner enough support when all Republicans and then-Democratic Sen. Manchin opposed it. 

A bipartisan group of federal lawmakers have taken steps to research paid family leave, but it hasn’t led to a bill. Democrats have proposed paid family leave bills akin to what Walz signed for a decade.
