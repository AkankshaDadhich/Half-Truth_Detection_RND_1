This is a radical change from their past, the video says. As evidence, it flashes to clips of comments by President Barack Obama, U.S. Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, D-Fla., and former U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder that are divorced from any context. The one-minute video plays snippets of journalists bashing Iowa Democrats over their bungled caucus in February before ending with a warning: Democrats couldnt run the Iowa Caucus. Dont let them redesign our entire election. The RNC launched its Protect the Vote website May 8, vowing to fight the Democrats assault on the integrity of our elections. But the clips of Democratic leaders are removed from the context of what they were talking about and ignore Obamas support for voting by mail in general at the time. The video also wrongly portrays the push for more mail-in voting as solely a Democratic effort. While Democratic leaders have pushed for more mail-in voting, they arent alone. Republican officeholders in at least 16 states that do not have all-mail elections were encouraging voters to cast ballots via mail. The RNCs former chairman in March called for conservatives to embrace broader use of voting by mail. RELATED: Donald Trumps dubious claim that 'thousands' are conspiring on mail-ballot fraud The ad starts with a clip of presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden stating, We have an incredible opportunity to not just dig out of this crisis but to fundamentally change this country. The text on the screen says, Democrats have a radical plan to change our elections. But Bidens statement was about protecting essential workers, not voting by mail or in person. He used a May 4 campaign event to talk about providing a livable wage and paid sick leave to workers including meat packers and grocery store clerks. Bidens campaign has said he wants safer options for voting, including voting by mail and in-person voting. At a virtual fundraiser in April, Biden told donors that we have to make it easier for everyone to vote if we are still in lockdown, including providing mail-in ballots. At a virtual fundraiser May 8, Biden praised a move by California Gov. Gavin Newsom to send a mail-in ballot to every voter. The video shows MSNBCs Chris Matthews asking Obama a question related to mail-in voting. They are talking about people mailing in their ballots. Do you trust the security, the honesty of such an election process? Matthews asked. Obama responded: Well, Id think we would have to figure out whether this was fraud-proof. The video doesnt clearly show the context of the interview; faint text on the screen says Decision 08. It would be possible for viewers to assume Obama was criticizing voting by mail in general, but Obama was commenting about a specific set of circumstances related to the presidential primary in Florida. In 2007, the Florida Legislature moved up the date of the presidential primary to Jan. 29, earlier than either national party permitted. Hillary Clinton beat Obama, but the Democratic National Committee determined that the election violated party rules and stripped the state of its delegates. In March 2008, some Florida Democrats proposed a do-over election including a scenario of entirely voting by mail. Here was Matthews full question on March 11, 2008, to then-Sen. Obama: Theres word from Florida that they intend to put out a mailing sort of a campaign — I mean, an election process, whereby they make up for the primary they had before, which was ruled out of order by the Democratic National Committee and you did not campaign in. Theyre talking about mailing it — people mailing in their ballots. Do you trust the security, the honesty of such an election process? The RNC video only included the first sentence of Obamas cautious response. But Obama then made some positive statements about voting by mail: I mean, Oregon, for example, has a terrific mail-in system, but theyve already scanned everybodys signatures whos registered to vote so that they can check to make sure that in fact the right people are voting. And thats something that I think youd have to figure out. During the 2020 pandemic, Obama has not expressly called for only voting by mail. He called for safe voting options while tweeting a New York Times story that debunked the claim that absentee voting favors Democrats and an NPR story about proposals to expand voting by mail and early voting. The clip in the video of Wasserman Schultz does not clearly show the context. The text on the screen reads postal primary do-over — but its difficult to decipher. Debbie Wasserman Schultz argues a mail-in ballot has wrong written all over it, a journalist says. The video then shows a clip of Wasserman Schultz, a Broward Democrat, stating: It would be a risky experiment for us with an election that has stakes as high as a presidential election does. The RNC video omits her next sentence: We've never done a mail-in ballot statewide. She also said that there's a way to solve this without totally redoing this and causing more chaos. Those clips are from a CNN report on March 10, 2008, about the idea for a mail-in primary do-over. Wasserman Schultz was talking about voting by mail in the narrow context of the proposed re-do election that spring. After months of wrangling that spring, the DNC agreed that Florida could send a full delegation to the convention, but each delegate would only get half a vote. Amid the pandemic, Wasserman Schultz said she supports expanding early voting and vote by mail options. The video also includes a quote by Eric Holder, a former Attorney General under Obama. No form of electoral fraud ever has been or will ever be tolerated by this administration, Holder said. That stems from a speech he gave about voting rights in 2012; he wasnt specifically talking about absentee ballot fraud. An RNC video says Joe Biden said voting by mail is a way to fundamentally change this country, contradicting past statements by Barack Obama and Debbie Wasserman Schultz. The RNC video only includes snippets of statements by Obama and Wasserman Schultz to leave viewers with a misleading impression that they were bashing voting by mail in general, and that wasnt the case. Obama and Wasserman Schultz were talking about voting by mail in a narrow set of circumstances: a controversial proposal to redo the presidential preference primary in Florida in 2008. There is no evidence that overall either Democrat was broadly critical of voting by mail as an option in elections. The portion of the video about Biden also omits context. The video quotes him stating we have an incredible opportunity to not just dig out of this crisis but to fundamentally change this country, before launching into the videos theme that Democrats want to use mail-in balloting to radically change American elections. But Biden wasnt talking about elections, he was talking about protecting workers amid the pandemic. This video includes actual quotes by these three Democrats, but lacks context to explain their remarks. This video rates Mostly False. UPDATE, May 15, 2020: We received a statement from the RNC after publication. It does not affect the rating of the fact-check.",0.4,0.7,0.8,0.7629604256

It's been that way now for almost two years.","As millions watch them during their national convention in Tampa, Republicans are trying to appear tough on illegal immigration without offending Hispanic voters.Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, who is bilingual and met his wife in Mexico, has warned his fellow Republicans they need to watch their tone on the immigration issue. He repeated that warning in an interview on Meet the Press the weekend before the convention.My personal view is that we need to get beyond where we are, Bush said. We need to create a climate of border control. And thats begun to happen, if you look at the number of illegal immigrants coming into the country, its net zero. Its been that way now for almost two years. And if you say, well, weve gotten a much better grasp on the number of people just coming in without papers, then you could develop a strategy thats part of economic growth. For this fact-check, we will research whether Bush was correct when he said the number of illegal immigrants coming into the country is net zero, and that its been that way for two years.Pew Hispanic Center studiesWe turned to the Pew Hispanic Center for an answer. The center is a nonpartisan research organization that does not take positions on policy issues.Its 2012 report about Mexican immigration concluded, After four decades that brought 12 million current immigrants -- most of whom came illegally -- the net migration flow from Mexico to the United States has stopped and may have reversed. The report was based on the centers analysis of federal census data.We interviewed Jeffrey Passel, a senior demographer at Pew and an expert on Hispanic immigration. He said that Bushs claim is true. Passel said that we can infer that the outflow of unauthorized immigrants exceeded inflows between 2007 and 2009 because the overall size of the unauthorized population living in the U.S. decreased between 2007 and 2009 from 12 million to 11.1 million.There are four ways the number of unauthorized immigrants changes: the inflow of new unauthorized immigrants, the outflow of those leaving the U.S., deaths and unauthorized immigrants gaining legal status.Those last three categories -- outflow out of the U.S., deaths and conversion to legal status -- exceeded the first category of new inflows of unauthorized immigrants by about 900,000 between 2007 and 2009. But deaths and conversion to legal status are not large figures. Therefore, Passel said, the major source of the decline is almost certainly an excess of outflow of unauthorized over inflow.You can read about Pews reports about net migration from Mexico here and in general about trends in the illegal immigration population here and here.We also sent Bushs claim to groups with opposing views on immigration and all agreed that Bushs statement was correct.I think you will find everybody agrees with it being zero or close to it, said Roy Beck, executive director of Numbers USA, which advocates for low immigration.A spokeswoman for The National Immigration Forum, which advocates for immigrants, sent us a New York Times op-ed piece co-written by two professors, one a former foreign minister of Mexico and the other co-director of the Mexican Migration Project at Princeton. That op-ed piece also stated that the rate of undocumented immigration is nearing zero. Our rulingBush said If you look at the number of illegal immigrants coming into the country, it is net zero. It's been that way now for almost two years.It is difficult to get a precise figure on the population of illegal immigrants. But data from Pew Hispanic Center, a widely respected source referred to by those of different political viewpoints on immigration, supports Bushs claim.",1,0,1,0.1118821626

False Confidence (between 0 and 1): 0.1",Says a portfolio managed by the Texas General Land Office earned 22 percent last year while the states emergency reserve account experienced a 1 percent gain.,"Criticizing a poke at his not releasing millions of dollars to support public schools, Texas Land Commissioner Jerry Patterson said that doing so might cut into double-digit returns on investments managed by the General Land Office.In a letter he made public Aug. 22, 2012, Patterson, a Republican, said that those who want him to transfer $300 million in investment earnings to the State Board of Education for school needs do not understand the value of keeping such money invested so the states education endowment, the Permanent School Fund, continues to gain value.A pro-Democratic group, Progress Texas, accuses Patterson of inappropriately hoarding the millions. Patterson counters that the School Land Board, which he chairs, has discretion over whether to transfer the money and, he told us by telephone, it has until September 2013 to decide. His spokesman, Jim Suydam, also told us by email that the board approved a resolution in early 2011 to release $250 million of earnings in both 2012 and 2013 to the State Board of Education.In his letter, Patterson said that draining off additional earnings as Progress Texas says he must is a bad choice... because last year the GLO-managed PSF earned 22 percent and, due to statutory liquidity requirements, the rainy day fund earned just 1 percent. He was comparing the portion of the Permanent School Fund managed by the land office to earnings on the states savings account, otherwise known as the Economic Stabilization Fund. If your family needed a quick infusion of cash, Patterson wrote, would you withdraw cash from the investment account earning 22 percent or the account earning 1 percent?Were not venturing that question, but wondered if Patterson made an accurate earnings comparison.Starting in 2005, the land office was given the authority to invest in real estate using proceeds received from selling lands or drawing on revenue from Permanent School Fund mineral leases and royalties, the agency notes on a web page. Professional fund management firms oversee the investments, the agency says, while the land board, consisting of the commissioner and two citizen appointees, manages the sale of Permanent School Fund land and mineral leases.To our inquiry, Suydam provided an agency report to the Legislature stating that through March 2012, the market value of the agencys investments made from the Permanent School Fund was $3.077 billion, about half of that reflecting externally managed direct real estate investments and nearly $1.2 billion attributable to short-term investments in the states treasury, which Suydam later said means money set aside so its on call for the agencys real estate investments.The report, dated Sept. 1, 2012, says that gross time-weighted returns on the portfolio in the 12 months through March amounted to nearly 22.9 percent, though that is without considering the short-term investments. Counting the cash-on-call portion, the report says, the time-weighted returns on the portfolio were 13.03 percent.Time-weighted returns?By email, Suydam told us the term describes a complex calculation that uses values for every day in the period being measured which, he said, explains why the 23 percent return shown for the real estate investments does not align with the 30 percent return that we calculated by comparing the market value of those investments at the end of March 2012 to the comparable figure at the end of March 2011.Asked how the earnings on real estate through March 2012 compare to recent 12-month periods, Suydam said such investments generated nearly 14 percent in market value in the 12 months through March 2011, but lost about 15 percent in the 12 months through March 2010.We checked on the rainy day funds earnings with Lauren Willis, spokeswoman for State Comptroller Susan Combs, who oversees state finances.Willis said by email that money in the reserve fund, created in 1988, is invested like other funds in the states treasury in stable, high-quality investments. In 2011, Willis said, the average yield on all those funds was 0.74 percent -- generating nearly $194 million in interest income including $51.9 million added to the rainy day fund. R.J. DeSilva, another Combs spokesman, said by email the rate of return might or might not have been about the same through the 12 months running through March 2012.In a telephone interview, we asked Patterson about why his letter mentions the higher returns on the real estate investments alone rather than also taking into account the lower returns influenced by the agencys cash-on-call funds.I dont count the cash, Patterson replied, because its not part of our investment portfolio.The land office, Patterson noted, is limited by law to managing just part of the overall education endowment. Suydam later said by email that as of the end of March, the market value of the agencys portion of the PSF, not including the value of minerals or state-owned land, was nearly $3.1 billion. He said the State Board of Education oversaw the funds remaining $25.6 billion.Our rulingPattersons reference to 22 percent in earnings over the 12 months running through March 2012 does not account for reduced earnings from nearly $1.2 billion in cash-on-call money supporting the agencys real estate investments. That clarification would be helpful, though it still seems reasonable, overall, to focus on the portion of the portfolio that would be expected to reap sizable gains. Separately, the claim seems to reflect the annual earnings on the rainy day fund, though the commissioners March-to-March time period does not match the calendar-year approach used by the state comptroller.",0.7,0.3,0.9,0.6120567463

Attendees at the May 7 luncheon peppered her with questions about Osama bin Ladens death, which took place just five days earlier. They asked about Georgias new immigration legislation and the Federal Emergency Management Agencys response to recent, historic tornadoes that devastated towns across the Southeast.One raised the touchiest -- literally -- of all of topics: getting patted down at the airport.Will we go past the grope-and-grab phase? a luncheon attendee asked Napolitano. The machines that scan the bodies and so forth? Are there better ways of doing it?Well, actually, very, very, very few people get a pat-down, Napolitano replied. Its only under very limited circumstances. They do, however, get -- those who are patted down -- tend to get on YouTube. she quipped.And look, look, no one wants to see a 6-year-old patted down. Even if its done according to procedural protocol, she said. In April, a video was posted on YouTube.com of a 6-year-old girl being patted down at the New Orleans airport.Just this week, images of a baby getting frisked at Kansas City International Airport made headlines as well.Very, very, very few people? we wondered. Thats a lot of verys.Given the public outcry, Napolitanos estimate sent PolitiFact Georgia scribes scrambling.We asked the Transportation Security Administration for more details. The TSA is part of the Department of Homeland Security and protects the nations transportation systems.Last fall, the TSA began to use special scanners that showed images of passengers including what was underneath their clothing. Critics called it a virtual strip search and said it was too invasive.The TSA offered pat-downs as an alternative, but these also frustrated critics. In October, the agency announced that officers would implement enhanced pat-down procedures. Previously, screeners used the backs of their hands to inspect sensitive areas. Now they use the front of their hands and conduct a more thorough search.Adults can also receive pat-downs on a random basis. Children receive modified pat-downs if they require extra screening.As the busy Thanksgiving travel week approached, passengers complained about having their genitals and breasts touched. A video appeared on YouTube.com of a toddler crying during the pat-down and shouting for a screener to stop. Parents were outraged. Travelers threatened they would stop flying, and some predicted long airport security lines.The expected chaos never materialized. For the most part, passengers went through the screening process without a fuss.All in all, people wanted to get to their destinations, said Christopher Bidwell, a security expert with the industry group Airports Council International.We asked the TSA how many pat-downs it conducts at the nations airports.Atlanta TSA spokesman Jon Allen told us that during March, 3 percent of air passengers were subject to a pat-down. The TSA collects this data by monitoring data from select airports throughout the year, he wrote in an email. That number is consistent with that of previous time periods.PolitiFact Georgia looked for other pat-down data to see whether other groups have verified TSA numbers. Critics such as the American Civil Liberties Union and passenger rights groups did not. Neither did industry groups we contacted. We did find a Gallup poll conducted Nov. 19-21 that said 15 percent of adults who have flown two or more times in the past year received a full-body pat-down. The surveys margin of error was 4 percentage points. The 15 percent figure does not contradict the TSA figures. The more often you pass through a security checkpoint, the more chance youll receive a pat-down.PolitiFact Georgia therefore took the TSA figures and did some math. The TSAs Allen told us that on an average day, about 2 million people are screened at TSA checkpoints. Three percent of 2 million is 60,000 people.That means that over the course of a month, roughly 1.8 million people receive a pat-down. Thats more than four times the population of Atlanta.That doesnt sound like very, very, very few people to us.If Napolitano said that a small percentage of passengers get patted down each month, she would have been correct. But she talked about people. In addition, she used the superlative very three times, even though the TSAs own figures show that the numbers of passengers who receive a pat-down can top 1 million in a single month.",0.3,0.7,1,0.8324870393

False Confidence (between 0 and 1): 0.5",Says Democratic opponentsCal Cunningham and Erica Smith support sanctuary policies.,"Like many Republicans up for election, U.S. Sen. Thom Tillis is putting immigration at the forefront of his campaign. And to contrast himself with his Democratic opponents, hes pointing to state-level policies. In a Jan. 10 email newsletter, the Tillis campaign said Democrats Cal Cunningham and NC Sen. Erica Smith support sanctuary policies. The headline says: Sanctuary policies result in gruesome violence, do Cunningham and Smith still support them? The email goes on to talk about an illegal immigrant who was released from jail in Mecklenburg County despite the objections of the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (also known as ICE). Is it true that Cunningham and Smith support sanctuary policies? Not quite. Cunningham and Smith opposed a bill that would require North Carolina sheriffs to detain people on behalf of ICE. But neither has flat-out endorsed sanctuary policies. Each Democrat has said they believe local governments should have the flexibility to comply or not. About HB 370 Theres no single definition of what constitutes a sanctuary city. The term is loosely applied to cities or states that limit cooperation with federal immigration authorities. In some states, a city can ban its law enforcement from cooperating with ICE (thus earning the term sanctuary city.) But in North Carolina, sanctuary cities are banned. Former Gov. Pat McCrory signed a law prohibiting municipalities from blocking ICE cooperation. However, sheriffs still had (and still have) some wiggle room. Sheriffs can decide independently whether they want to comply with ICE. As PolitiFact NC has reported, ICE detainers arent valid warrants. So a handful of Democratic sheriffs declined to honor detainers. They said they didnt want to use local resources for federal business, and they feared that cooperating with ICE would harm relationships with their Hispanic constituents. That brings us to the Tillis campaigns argument. North Carolina lawmakers last year considered a bill that wouldve required sheriffs to comply with ICE. More specifically, the bill -- labeled House Bill 370 -- wouldve required North Carolina sheriffs to hold inmates for up to 48 hours beyond the terms of their jail sentence if requested to do so by ICE. Contacted by PolitiFact, Tillis spokesman Andrew Romero said the campaigns claim is based on Cunningham and Smith opposing House Bill 370. (PolitiFact has written about HB 370 previously, when President Trump made a Mostly False claim about Democratic congressional candidate Dan McCready.) The GOP-controlled state legislature passed HB 370. But Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper vetoed it, so it never became law. What Cunningham said The Tillis campaign cited an interview Cunningham conducted with WFAE in Charlotte. Reporter Steve Harrison asked Cunningham if he agreed with the Mecklenburg County Sheriffs decision to ignore ICE detainer requests. Cunningham said: I tend to trust law enforcement to discharge its duty, adding that Mecklenburg voters elected the sheriff and have the power to hold him accountable. I trust the voters in Mecklenburg County to weigh in on exactly that, he said. Heres what I know. That law enforcement makes difficult decisions every day. And as a United States senator, its not my job to second guess, its my job to make sure they have the resources they need to keep their communities safe. The Tillis campaign also noted Cunninghams opposition to a federal bill Tillis introduced. The bill that would compel local law enforcement officials to comply with federal detainer requests or face possible civil action by victims and the loss of federal grants. Asked about the bill, Cunningham campaign spokesman Aaron Simpson accused Tillis of threatening funding for North Carolina to score cheap political points, the Charlotte Observer reported. What Smith said As for Smith, she voted against HB 370 when it was before the state Senate. She also talked about the bill during a couple interviews. Speaking with WFAE, Smith cited some of the same arguments as Cunningham. But she also said she would be OK with local law enforcement honoring ICE detainer requests so long as the federal government paid for the costs. I'm fine (with sheriffs) detaining them if the federal government is going to foot the bill and do their jobs. Certainly, we do not want the release of people who are a threat to public safety, she said. But if ICE and Department of Homeland really wants us to close their detention, then they should pay for it. They're getting taxpayer dollars to do just that. Speaking with Tim Boyum on Spectrum News, Smith made the same argument. If you want the sheriffs to enforce and detain illegal immigrants, then send them the appropriations and the funding. That is the US Senates responsibility. Our ruling Tillis said Cunningham and Smith support sanctuary policies. Both candidates oppose a bill that would require sheriffs to comply with ICE. But thats not the same as endorsing sanctuary cities. In fact, Smith said she would support a sheriffs decision to comply with ICE if ICE offered financial assistance. His statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context.",0.5,0.6,0.9,0.4437611931

False Confidence (between 0 and 1): 0.7",Video shows Joe Biden saying we can only re-elect Donald Trump.,"A manipulated video that purports to show Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden endorsing Donald Trump for president is making the rounds on social media. The video, created March 7, 2020, by President Donald Trumps campaign, was shared by the president and thousands of others — including at least two prominent Wisconsin legislative leaders: Assembly Majority Leader Jim Steineke and Wisconsin Assembly Speaker Robin Vos. Vos, R-Rochester, attached this critique to his retweet: Omg. We all stumble once in awhile but how can the media ignore this kind of stuff EVERY single day? The implication is that the video shows news the media should be covering. So lets take a closer look at the 14-second clip. The clip in question originated at a March 7, 2020, Biden rally in Kansas City. The YouTube livestream from Bidens official account shows the actual statement. Biden verbally stumbles several times before making a call for party unity, and a pitch for himself as the unifying candidate. Heres what he says, with pauses noted by an ellipsis. We cannot get reelect We cannot win this reelection Excuse me — we can only re-elect Donald Trump if in fact we get engaged in this circular firing squad here. The Trump War Room shared a clip that cut offafter the word Trump. So Biden is shown saying, We can only re-elect Donald Trump — the opposite of what was actually stated. Starting the clip at the first stumble also eliminates the preceding context that helps explain Bidens sentence construction. He calls himself a lifelong Democrat and a nominee who will bring this party together. PolitiFact National rated the edited video Mostly False for deceptive editing via omission. And they noted Biden had referenced his point more clearly earlier that day in St. Louis: If you want a nominee who will bring the party together, who will run a positive, progressive vision for the future — not turn this primary into a campaign of negative attacks because that will only re-elect Donald Trump if we go that route. Twitter also added the label of manipulated media to a tweet of the video from Dan Scavino, Trumps director of social media, on March 8 under a new policy. The policy applies to synthetic and manipulated media including videos, audio and images. Vos (and Steineke) left the shared video up long after it was known to be dishonestly edited. We should also note that tweeting manipulated media is not a new thing for Vos. On Feb. 25, 2020, he retweeted a post from the Wisconsin College Republicans that condemned liberal state Supreme Court candidate Jill Karofsky, saying, Dont let (Karofsky) destroy our Constitution with her judicial activism. The text appeared with a sloppily edited series of images implying Karofsky was tearing up the Constitution. The images superimpose Karofskys head on U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosis body from the well-known Feb. 4, 2020, State of the Union where Pelosi tore up her copy of Trumps speech. Vos says the media is ignoring a video showing Biden saying, we can only re-elect Donald Trump. Vos implies by his statement that the video is an accurate representation of reality — and therefore worthy of media coverage. But the clip in question was cut off-mid sentence, fundamentally changing a statement that actually said Trump would only be re-elected if in fact (Democrats) get engaged in this circular firing squad here.",0.4,0.8,1,0.1729991326

MARTA, metro Atlantas mass transit system, has said it could use $4 billion for various expansion projects. The Obama administration has set aside that much money for its Race to the Top education program. Or, perhaps, you can buy the New York Yankees andthe Beatles music catalog and still have about $1 billion to spare.Heres a disturbing figure concerning $4 billion.An average of $4 billion is added to the national debt every day, U.S. Sens. Saxby Chambliss, R-Ga., and Mark Warner, D-Va., wrote in a March 29 op-ed.Is it really that much money? We wanted to find out.The estimate is aimed at raising awareness among Americans into facing and dealing with what the two senators believe is one of the nations biggest problems -- its rapidly rising debt. Chambliss and Warner will come to Atlanta on Monday to talk about the debt to more than 500 business and community leaders at an event hosted by the Rotary Club of Atlanta.The two senators are part of whats been called the Gang of Six -- a group of six senators working on ways to lower the debt. The budget deficit and national debt are big issues in Washington as Democrats and Republicans debate how to best cut spending.Every dollar that we spend simply paying the interest on our nations staggering debt is disappearing into a fiscal sinkhole, they wrote. These are resources that cannot be targeted toward creating jobs, expanding the U.S. economy or addressing any of our other shared priorities.We wondered if Chambliss and Warner had their math right -- or are they trying to scare the public with false and gaudy numbers?PolitiFact Virginia checked out a prior claimin December by Warner that the debt grew by an estimated $15 billion in one weekend. They ruled his claim was on the money.There are two kinds of federal debt and interest -- the debt held by the public and the total debt. About $9.65 trillion -- yes, trillion -- of that debt is held by the public, which includes individuals, companies and state, local and foreign governments, according to the U.S. Treasury Department. The rest, about $4.6 trillion, is held by the Federal Financing Bank, government trust funds, other funds and accounts. The total debt is about $14.25 trillion. Those numbers are as of April 6, 2011, the most recent figures available. The interest on the debt for the federal fiscal year of 2010 was nearly $414 billion, Treasury Department figures show.So, to see how fast the public debt is growing, we looked at the total on two other dates.On Dec. 31, 2010, it was $9.4 trillion. A year earlier, the debt held by the public was $7.8 trillion.Between the end of 2009 and April 6, 2011, the public debt has risen by an average of just above $4 billion a day. In 2010, it grew by an average of $4.3 billion a day. The pace of debt increase does seem to have slowed this year. The debt has risen by $250 billion between the end of 2010 and April 6, an average of $2.6 billion a day.If you look at the total debt, the average daily increase is about $4.3 billion. In 2010, it grew by about $4.7 billion a day. In 2011, the total debt has risen by about $2.45 billion a day.Our math shows the debt has grown by an average of more than $4 billion per day since 2009. It grew by that rate during 2010 as well. The average daily rate has slowed to slightly less than $3 billion so far this year. Either number shows the debt is indeed a big problem.The senators op-ed did not detail what time frame they were discussing to spell out their claim. They said they were basing it off Warners claim that had been checked of what amounted to $5 billion a day and decided to be conservative and chose the $4 billion daily estimate. This year, their claim is off by about $1 billion. Over the last two years, its correct.",0.85,0.15,0.95,0.9385327878

And in his bid to retake that job Nov. 6, 2012, he has said he served them well: Daugherty is the reason we do not pay a toll every time we pass over the bridge at MoPac and William Cannon, according to a campaign flier.That bridge was at the center of debate over the regions 2004 toll road plan -- a debate so heated it launched an effort to recall two Austin City Council members and the mayor.Road wrangling in Precinct 3 hasnt calmed down much since then; the fight over Texas 45 Southwest underpinned a fact-check we recently wrote about Daughertys Democratic opponent, incumbent Karen Huber.In fact, Daugherty bumper stickers in his 2012 race read, Want SH 45 SW built? Vote for Gerald Daugherty.So we wondered: Was he the reason the toll at William Cannon didnt happen?Its a bold claim, Daugherty said when we called him. We probably shouldnt have used that definitive a position versus saying, I was one of the people that led the charge against  the toll, he said.Campaign manager Kathy Pillmore told us by email that the flier was mailed out May 10, 2012, in advance of the May 29 primary vote. Daugherty bested two fellow Republicans in the primary and now faces Huber, who defeated him for the seat in 2008, and Libertarian nominee Pat Dixon.Pillmore said the campaign stands by the statement. Daughertys website features a slightly different version: William Cannon Toll Bridge - working with State Representative Terry Keel we were instrumental in stopping TxDOT from tolling the overpass at Loop 1 South and William Cannon Road.The Texas Department of Transportation was in a fix at the time, Daugherty said, lacking sufficient money to build new roads while maintaining existing roads. Tollways were one option.A Dec. 27, 2004, Austin American-Statesman transportation column recapped the opening salvos of The Great Turnpike War of 2004: (I)n April, the Central Texas Regional Mobility Authority and Bob Daigh, the Austin district engineer for the Texas Department of Transportation, unveiled a toll road plan of eye-popping scope: ... a $1.8 billion, seven-road plan.  The reaction locally was subdued at first, and even a well-attended public hearing in May was relatively low-key. But then state Rep. Terry Keel of Austin and Travis County Commissioner Gerald Daugherty, Republicans with a history of supporting roads, unexpectedly came out against parts of the plan, especially levying tolls on a short stretch of MoPac Boulevard (Loop 1) at William Cannon Drive. Double taxation, they called it, because the project, already under construction, was being built with (state) gasoline tax dollars.  (Circle C neighborhood resident Sal) Costello began a recall petition campaign against Austin Mayor Will Wynn and two other council members who voted for the plan  (B)ehind the scenes, talks continued about how to change the plan and quell the uproar.  A Sept. 20, 2004, Statesman news story referring to the uproar said, The spark that lighted that still out-of-control blaze was the state's plan to charge people a half-buck to stay on MoPac and avoid the light at William Cannon Drive.Daugherty said, according to a Statesman news story from May 4, 2004, and transportation column from May 31, 2004, that he got 600 phone calls in three days objecting to the toll plan and more than 200 messages in the first week and a half after it was announced.What got Austin drivers hopping mad was the fact that a toll was going to be charged on a road that had already been paid for.Drawing on state gas tax revenues, work had started on the 1.45-mile overpass earlier in 2004. Until MoPac traffic could sail above William Cannon, drivers were funneled through the stoplights there.Daugherty recalled: They were just about ready to lay the columns across those pillars that had been there forever, and we all knew that, Wow, were just about to get this road, this bridge put across. And man, wont that be great, because everyones not going to have to get off.The plan unveiled April 24, 2004, included a toll there precisely because the overpass was incomplete.Daigh, the TxDOT engineer who drafted the plan with the Central Texas Regional Mobility Authority, told us in a recent telephone interview that few Austin roads were eligible for tolls because tolls could not be charged on an existing road or a road that had no alternative route. The 2004 plan, he said, included every option in the area.When the plan was announced, Daugherty recalled, You talk about people coming unhinged. He said he heard opposition from both residents and businesspeople in his precinct, which covers southwestern Travis County and contains the overpass site.A Nov. 28, 2004, Statesman transportation column said Keel and Daugherty had held a press conference in May of that year condemning the toll road plan. The column said residents opposition and elected officials work got the William Cannon toll dropped.Daugherty told us, I think I probably was the lead person on it. But Terry and I did the press conference together and said, OK, well, hey, were just not going to be supportive of this.  He said he believes his opposition was influential in part because I was so well-known for being supportive of roadways.But yes, he said, it was not a one-man show: I guess if someone wants to say technically, you werent the only guy... Anybody that knew anything about it knew that I was the energy behind fighting this like the dickens.The toll plan was added to the regions long-range transportation plan by a July 12, 2004, vote of the Capital Area Metropolitan Planning Organization board.At that meeting, we learned via email from CAMPO assistant director Bubba Needham, Daugherty moved to delete the toll from the MoPac overpass after he and other members of the board (which is composed mostly of local elected officials) spoke against the plan. His motion failed 17-6, according to the minutes. Voting with him to delete the toll were Keel and fellow Republican state Reps. Todd Baxter and Jack Stick; Democratic state Rep. Elliott Naishtat; and Austin City Council Member Daryl Slusher.Afterward, according to the minutes, the board voted 16-7 to add the toll proposals to the long-range plan; the seven opposed were those who voted for Daughertys motion plus Democratic state Rep. Eddie Rodriguez.Six months later, the board reversed course by adopting a resolution to remove the overpass from toll consideration. According to the minutes of the boards Jan. 24, 2005, meeting, board chair Gonzalo Barrientos told the board that although that toll had been seen as an essential source of money to improve MoPac, he, Mayor Will Wynn and Precinct 2 commissioner Karen Sonleitner had gotten financial backing from the Texas Transportation Commission to go ahead with the MoPac work without those toll revenues.Barrientos said, according to the minutes, that an engineering concern with the overpass had come up. Asked to explain that issue, Daigh said that the mobility authority had decided drivers would end up in a traffic jam.According to the minutes, Barrientos moved to de-toll the overpass, citing the traffic jam concern and noting the toll revenue was no longer an issue. The motion passed.We called Barrientos to get his take on who was most responsible for getting the overpass toll dropped. No single person makes such a decision happen, he told us, but Daugherty was key.The commissioners consistent opposition to the overpass toll, speaking up every time the issue came up, surely helped, he said.Barrientos characterized the discussion that he, Wynn and Sonleitner had with the Transportation Commission as the type of negotiations needed to reach any agreement and said there might have been others helping to reach the agreement.I think probably everybody gets credit, he said, but Daugherty was in the forefront.Daigh, who is now senior director of infrastructure for Williamson County, told us he believes there would be a toll on that road if not for Daugherty. He was the leader of the effort not to have MoPac tolled, Daigh said.Our rulingDaugherty told us he overstated in claiming that he is the reason we do not pay a toll every time we pass over the bridge at MoPac and William Cannon.He was an early and prominent opponent. But his claim leaves out the many residents and public officials who spoke, lobbied and voted against the overpass toll and worked to find an alternative. No one person was the reason theres no toll at the bridge.",0.6,0.3,1,0.6379710642

It's always Trump and Clinton and then second question, third question. ... If we were included in the top line, as Johnson/Trump/Clinton, we'd be at 20 percent.","The only poll that matters, dealers in political cliches tell us, is the one taken on Election Day. For third party candidates, the Committee on Presidential Debates has imposed another consequential metric: they must reach 15 percent in a select set of polls if they want access to the debates and the attention and credibility that are attached. Right now, it looks like Clinton and Trump will be alone on stage come debate season. But if the polls were just conducted differently, Libertarian presidential candidate Gary Johnson has suggested he would easily meet that requirement. None of the polls being conducted right now have us on the top line. None of them. It's always Trump and Clinton and then second question, third question, Well, what if you add Johnson-Weld?, Johnson told CNBC on August 22. In a couple of other cases Johnson specified how well he thinks hed be doing if he were listed as an option in pollsters first horse-race question: 20 percent, more than enough to qualify for the debates. I think if we were included in the top line, as Johnson/Trump/Clinton, we'd be at 20 percent. A lot of that has to do with how polarizing the two of them are. But that's the issue right now. We need to be top line on the polls, Johnson said in another CNBC interview on Aug. 11. This would be quite a swing. Theodore Roosevelt was the last third-party presidential candidate to register more than 20 percent of the vote on Election Day, running as a Bull Moose in 1912, and Ross Perot reached18.9 percent in 1992. We decided to look at whether the polls are really being conducted the way Johnson says, and if it really has such a dramatic impact. We looked at 25 national polls conducted in July and August, chosen off of a list compiled by FiveThiryEight.com. Based on this list, we can say that Johnson is certainly wrong that every poll asks about Clinton and Trump before adding his name in a later question. Eleven of the polls we looked at -- close to half -- included Johnson in their first or only question about the presidential horse-race. None of these polls vaulted Gary Johnson to 20 percent. In fact, he did slightly worse, on average, when he was included in the first horse-race question. Johnsons average in the 25 polls was 9 percent. When he was listed in a later horse-race question, his average performance was slightly higher than that average. In the polls where he was listed in the first or only horse-race question, Johnson did slightly worse on average. Some of his best performances -- 12 percent in polls conducted for Fox News and International Business Daily and 13 percent in a poll conducted for CNN -- were in polls that listed him in a later question. We ran Johnsons theory by several academics who study polling. While research hasnt been done on the specific question Johnson addresses, they told us that question order could have an effect on polling results. All of them were, however, skeptical that the effect could be as large as Johnson suggested. It's not a totally crazy notion to think that including him in the first round versus not might affect his support. As a researcher, I would ask how big an effect that would have to be to get the kind of outcome he said.  You would have to have an effect of about 12 percent shift, which to me is just implausible, Adam Berinsky, a professor of political science at MIT. Even if there was some sort of bias introduced by the question order, it wouldnt necessarily be in his favor. (Trump and Clinton) have the lowest favorability ratings of presidential candidates in recent memory. So I could spin a story that would suggest if you first ask about Clinton or Trump without Johnson, you kind of prime people to think I dont really like either of these folks. And then you include the question with him in it, and they say, Oh, theres another option, Berinsky said. When reached for comment about this article, Johnson communications director Joe Hunter wrote in an email that, As far as the issue of whether a third candidate is included in the first ballot test question, or added to a subsequent question, we believe it does, indeed, make a difference, and pollsters with whom we work agree. Since Johnsons likely to appear on the ballot in all 50 states, it's worth considering why any pollster puts forward a horse-race question without including his name. Support for third party candidates tends to flag down the stretch, with many of their supporters leaving for one of the major party options. Questions that only offer those candidates allow pollsters to get a sense of how people currently registering support for third parties might break if that happens. It's worth noting that Johnson seems to be bucking this trend, according to a recent articleby the polling analysts at 538. Based on current polling, 538s polls-plus general election forecast, which adjusts for economic factors and historical trends, expects Johnson to earn a bigger percentage of the vote than any third-party candidate since Ross Perot in 1992. Our ruling Johnson said that polls ask about a straight Clinton/Trump race first, cueing them to ignore his name when it appears later. He said that including his name in the first questions pollsters asked about the horse-race could increase his support to 20 percent. Many polls do include Johnsons name in their first horse-race poll, and Johnson does not do better in these polls. Experts say the jump Johnson is talking about is implausible. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/5b71a65b-45a3-4b7b-bb80-9222bc73ff4e",0.3,0.7,0.8,0.7988972087

The act also allows members of a racial or language minority group to challenge a plan limiting or diminishing their opportunity to participate in elections and to elect candidates of their choice.Redistricting expert Justin Levitt, a professor at Loyola Law School, told us the court has interpreted the act to mean jurisdictions must protect the voting power of a group of racial and ethnic minorities if its large enough, compact enough and cohesive enough--and would not be able to exercise political power if the electoral process was left to its own devices.Now, the flashback: Lawmakers in 1991 designed two of three added House districts as opportunity districts giving Latino voters a good shot at electing candidates of their choice. Frank Tejeda, a Democratic state senator, then captured the San Antonio-rooted 28th district, while voters in Houstons 29th district advanced another senator, Democrat Gene Green.Texas wound up with seven Latino-opportunity districts, a number that did not change after last decades redistricting.How do those opportunity districts shake out under the map offered in May?For starters, the map breaks up the state into 36 districts, counting four districts gained courtesy of population increases this past decade. Two new districts, one in the Houston area, the other in Dallas-Fort Worth, are not considered minority-opportunity districts.Another, the 34th district, stretches from Brownsville in Cameron County to Hidalgo County north toward Corpus Christi and is 82 percent Hispanic. But observers do not view the district as a Latino-opportunity gain; its a swap for the current Latino-opportunity district rooted in Corpus Christi and carried in 2010 by Republican Blake Farenthold.Then again, the remap includes the new 35th district running from East Austin into San Antonio. Its overall population is 63 percent Hispanic, according to information compiled by the legislative council; 45 percent of its 2010 registered voters had Spanish surnames. Perales told us Latino voters could elect the candidate of their choice in the district.This appears to give the state an additional Latino-opportunity district compared with 1991.Not so, Perales said, because its offset by redraws of San Antonios 20th district and the 23rd district stretching west from San Antonio that dilute Latino voting power.Among factors she aired: The share of Spanish-surnamed voters in the 20th district, which is represented by Charlie Gonzalez, would drop from 58 percent now to 49 percent. In the 23rd district, where Democrat Rick Noriega bested GOP U.S. Sen. John Cornyn in 2008, Cornyn prevails in the redrawn version.If you create a new opportunity and you take away an opportunity, theres no net gain, Perales said.State Sen. Kel Seliger, R-Amarillo, who chairs the Senate Redistricting Committee, told us lawmakers had to shift Hispanic residents from Gonzalezs district to ensure the new Austin-to-San Antonio district would be a Latino-opportunity district. He urged us to visit further with Austin lawyer Bob Heath, an adviser to the committee.Heath said its hard for legislators to create more Latino-opportunity districts because the Hispanic population is younger than the rest of Texas, and its proportionate share of voting-age residents is smaller. He said too that such residents arent always geographically concentrated and Latino voter registration and turnout tends to run low in part because there are more Latino non-citizens than in other subgroups.Heath said that in his opinion, he said, the 20th district is always going to elect an Hispanic in the Democratic primary and the Democrat is going to win. He declined to comment on the 23rd district.No doubt, appraising opportunity districts is tricky. This is why political scientists get paid every 10 years, for taking all the factors into account and judging districts, Levitt said. Its nuanced.Its also subject to legal argument. Courts have been asked to judge the redo of congressional districts that ultimately won legislative approval.Our judgment: If MALDEFs characterizations stick, the May remap promised six to seven Latino-opportunity districts -- at best the same as 1991.But if Republican defenders are correct, the remap offers eight Latino-opportunity districts--a one-seat bump. However, the proportion of Latino-opportunity seats circa 2012--22 percent--would be virtually unchanged in 20 years. Thats because greatly Latino population growth has helped Texas edge to 36 total seats, compared to 30 in 1991.",0.6,0.5,0.8,0.2194783519

It says that in 2008 Hannity said that President Barack Obamas willingness to meet with North Korea is one of the most disturbing displays of Obamas lack of foreign policy experience. But in 2018, Hannity said President Donald Trumps willingness to meet with North Korea is a huge foreign policy win.  We hit the transcripts and video files. For the most part, those words accurately reflect what Hannity said. A week before Election Day 2008, Hannity gave 10 reasons not to vote for Obama. No. 2 on his list concerned talking to unfriendly regimes. One of the most disturbing displays of Obama's lack of foreign policy expertise came during last year's YouTube debate, Hannity said Oct. 26, 2008. The junior senator from Illinois gave what many called a naive answer for a question from the audience about whether he would meet with the leaders of Syria, Venezuela, Cuba or North Korea without preconditions. Asked during that debate if he would be willing to meet with those leaders without preconditions, Obama said I would, and compared that to previous presidents. Ronald Reagan and Democratic presidents like JFK constantly spoke to the Soviet Union at a time when Ronald Reagan called them an evil empire, Obama said. And the reason is because they understood that we may not trust them and they may pose an extraordinary danger to this country, but we had the obligation to find areas where we can potentially move forward. The image mentioned only North Korea, while Hannity listed several countries. When news broke that Trump was open to meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, Hannity voiced support. A huge foreign policy win for President Trump, Hannity said March 8. Little Rocket Man blinks. Now, the presidents tough rhetoric, his bold action, his severe sanctions, they appear to be working tonight. President Trump is accepting an invitation to meet with the North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un by May, and Pyongyang is agreeing to stop all nuclear and missile tests while these talks are underway. And the sanctions? They will continue. So the text in the image matches what Hannity said. But his criticism of Obama and his praise for Trump came in the context of different policies. Obamas policy on North Korea grew more complicated over time. But initially, it was fairly simple, said Penn State international affairs professor Joseph DeThomas. Preconditions meant that in order for talks to happen, North Korea had to agree that the purpose was the complete denuclearization of North Korea. During the campaign and early in his term Obama was very open to talks without preconditions, DeThomas said. For Trump, the picture is murkier. When Trump tweeted that he would meet with Kim Jong Un, North Korea had not taken any steps toward denuclearization. He said they had talked about it. Kim Jong Un talked about denuclearization with the South Korean representatives, not just a freeze, Trump wrote. Also, no missile testing by North Korea during this period of time. Kim Jong Un talked about denuclearization with the South Korean Representatives, not just a freeze. Also, no missile testing by North Korea during this period of time. Great progress being made but sanctions will remain until an agreement is reached. Meeting being planned! But for North Korea, denuclearization applies to the entire peninsula, which has implications for the American presence and military posture in South Korea. That is not the same as simply agreeing to a North Korea without nukes. DeThomas said testing halts are customary during talks with North Korea. Beyond that, North Korea made no concessions or took any steps toward ending its nuclear program. Trump has imposed stricter sanctions and has been more ready to hint at using military force against North Korea. But in terms of having direct talks between the leaders of both nations, DeThomas said this administration set a lower bar than what previous presidents have demanded. The Trump precondition for talks was that North Korea had to halt nuclear and missile testing for some unspecified period of time prior to commencement of talks, DeThomas said.  In February, Vice President Mike Pence drew headlines when he said sanctions and direct talks could happen at the same time. To some observers, that meant the administration was willing to talk without the precondition of North Korea agreeing to a future free of nukes. DeThomas characterized such words as loosey goosey, but not indicative of a major change. In that regard, when Hannity praised Trump, the administrations overall policy was tougher than what Obama had articulated when he ran for president. But the fact remains that Trump had agreed to a meeting before North Korea had taken any concrete steps toward ridding itself of nuclear weapons. The side-by-side quotes cast Hannity as criticizing Obama for being willing to talk to North Korea while praising Trump for his willingness to do the same thing. The quotations are pretty much accurate. But the image glosses over the different policy preferences of each man at the time Hannity spoke. In 2008, Obama said simply there were no preconditions for a meeting with the leader. In 2018, Trumps administration voiced some relaxation on preconditions, but not a full rejection of them. At the same time, Trump agreed to a meeting before North Korea had done more than agree to hold off on testing during any talks.",1,0.2,1,0.1524778009

When Stigall mentioned that Hillary Clinton has been paid lucratively for giving speeches to Wall Street banks, Toomey responded by making a comparison between Clinton and himself. It's entirely possible, said Toomey that the democratic nominee, Hillary Clinton, earned more money giving a single speech on Wall Street than I made the six years that I was there back in the 1980s. In fact, he went on, its quite likely. We reached out to the Toomey campaign multiple times seeking information about how much he earned during his six years on Wall Street, but they never got back at us. The hefty salaries of modern-day Wall Street traders are viewed by many with disgust, but 30 years ago, Wall Street was a very different place. Is it possible Pat Toomey earned less on Wall Street than Clinton did for a single speech there? We decided to find out. How much has Hillary made for her speeches? Its no secret Clinton has made a lot money from giving speeches, but most of the speeches that shes given were not to Wall Street banks. According to her 2014 tax return, 14 of the 41 speeches Clinton gave in 2013 were to Wall Street banks, and she was paid the same amount, $225,000, for most of them. But on Oct. 7, 2014, her Public Financial Disclosure Report report states that she gave a speech to Deutsche Bank and earned $260,000 for it. CNN compiled a list of all the amounts that the Clintons have earned for speaking to big banks from February 2001 to May 2015, and it reaffirms that amount for her Deutsche Bank speech. But Toomeys claim specifically refers to Wall Street. If Clinton made $260,000 in her most profitable speech to a Wall Street firm, then Toomey would have had to have made an average of about $43,000 during his six years on Wall Street for his claim to be true. The Rise of the Stock Market and the Traders in it Toomey worked on Wall Street from 1984 to 1990 for Chemical Bank and Morgan Grenfell. In a 1999 interview with Derivatives Strategy magazine, Toomey discussed the work he did at Morgan Grenfell, where he said he and a few others were recruited to start a serious derivatives operation. We were dealing in various currencies, said Toomey, all kinds of interest rate and currency-related derivatives—options, swaps, forwards and so on. A report by the Los Angeles Times confirmed Toomey traded derivatives around interest rates and currencies. Again, when we asked the Toomey campaign if they could provide us with approximate salary figures for Toomey or Wall Street derivatives traders in the 1980s, we didnt receive a response. Luckily, there are some figures we can use as approximations. The derivatives market exploded during Toomeys time on Wall Street. In fact, the size of the global derivatives industry more than quintupled from 1986 to 1991. According to a report by Mother Jones, the notional value of derivatives contracts went from $865 billion to nearly $4.5 trillion. Salaries for Wall Street employees were not nearly as lucrative as they are today, but employees there were still among the highest-paid in the nation. A New York Times article from 1987 put the average salary on Wall Street that year at $65,000, before bonuses (which was more than three times the average New Yorkers salary of $19,000). That number included all Wall Street employees, from the highest-ranking positions to new analysts. According to the Derivatives magazine article, Toomeys position at Chemical Bank was associate, a position generally considered to be above entry level and often given to people with MBAs.  Philip Bond, a professor of finance and business economics at the University of Washington, said a salary of $43,000 was within the realm of possibility. I guess an average of $43,000 a year strikes me as being on the low side, said Bond, But I don't think it is impossible. After talking to colleagues here, I believe the starting salary for an undergraduate on Wall Street would have been considerably less than $43,000 in 1985. However even in the 1980s, Wall Street traders generally earned significant bonuses along with their annual salaries. Former bonds salesman Michael Lewis wrote about how bonuses were determined in his bestselling book Liars Poker. A salesman's year-end bonus was determined by traders, writes Lewis,  A trader's bonus was determined by the profits on his trading books. A salesman had no purchase on a trader, while a trader had complete control over a salesman. Toomey doesnt appear to have been a bad trader. Morgan Grenfell hired him and other associates to start its derivatives operation in 1986, according to the Derivatives Strategy magazine article.  If Toomey made significant profits as a derivatives trader, then he would likely have made a solid bonus along with his salary. Lewis, as he notes in Liars Poker, made a bonus of $45,000 in his first year as a bonds salesman, matching his $45,000 salary that year. Lewis had a M.A. in economics when he entered Wall Street, while Toomey only had a B.A. in government. It is possible Toomey made an annual compensation of less than $43,000 per year, but that seems unlikely when we take a bonus into account. And even if he did make an average of $43,000 a year during his time on Wall Street, inflation would put his total haul at well above $260,000. We asked two professors to help us adjust a 1985 salary of $43,000 for wage inflation. Ehud Ronn, a professor of finance at the University of Texas at Austin, also noted the figure of $43,000 a year seemed somewhat low. Ronnused an index that reporteda historical time series of compensation in the financial sector. According to the index, a salary of $43,200 in March 1985 would be equivalent to $124,200 in 2016. If Toomey made an average of $124,200 over six years, he would have made $745,200 in 2016 dollars according to this estimate. Bond, the University of Washington professor of finance, used GDP per capita to adjust for wage inflation. Nominal GDP per capita is about 4 times as high today is in the mid-1980s said Bond, So if financial compensation had grown at the same speed as nominal GDP per capita, $43K in 1985 would equate to roughly $170K today. If Toomey made an average of $170,000 over six years, he would have made $1,020,000 in 2016 dollars according to this estimate. Based on these back-of-envelope calculations, I suspect Toomey's statement is true, or at least close to true, started Bond, but if he adjusted for inflation, his claim is most likely not true. Lynn Stout, a professor of corporate law at Cornell University and an internationally recognized expert in the field of financial derivatives, seemed to believe that a yearly figure of $43,000 would have been very low even in the 1980s. If he did receive only $43,000 a year for six years of trading, said Stout, he must have been one of the worst performing and worst paid derivatives traders on Wall Street at the time. Our ruling Pat Toomey said that it was possible and even likely that Hillary Clinton earned more money giving a single speech to a Wall Street bank than he did in his six years there. Clinton earned $260,000 in her most profitable speech to a Wall Street bank, so Toomey would have had to have earned an average of about $43,000 per year on Wall Street. Its possible the entry-level salary for a trader was less than $43,000 in the 1980s, but Toomey was a trader at the forefront of the derivatives operation at Morgan Grenfell. So its likely he earned a significant bonus, which would put his earnings over that threshold. It gets less likely if we adjust Toomeys non-bonus-inflated potential salary for inflation. An annual salary of about $43,000 in 1985 would make significantly more than $260,000 over six years in 2016 dollars. And Toomey didnt just say it was possible he made less in six years on Wall Street than Clinton did in one speech. He said it was likely. Based on average salaries and bonuses from this era of Wall Street and input from experts, it does not seem likely. It gets less likely if we adjust Toomeys non-bonus-inflated potential salary for inflation. An annual salary of about $43,000 in 1985 would make significantly more than $260,000 over six years in 2016 dollars.",0.5,0.6,1,0.3543651336

Jan Brewer on April 23, 2010, shows no signs of ebbing, despite a last-minute change to the law's language designed to placate some of the laws' critics.Generally speaking, the law, which would go into effect in 90 days, makes being an illegal immigrant a state crime and requires legal immigrants to carry papers that confirm their legal status.One of the key questions to emerge during and after its passage has been what standard law enforcement officers will need to use before questioning individuals about their immigration status. Drawing special attention is the role played by racial profiling -- that is, the use of racial or ethnic characteristics as a justification for police questioning.Critics had said that the original version of the law permitted racial profiling. But the changes signed by Brewer on April 30 were intended to blunt those charges.The new version of the law says: A law enforcement official or agency of this state or a county, city, town or other political subdivision of this state may not consider race, color or national origin in implementing the requirements of this subsection except to the extent permitted by the United States or Arizona Constitution.The prior version had said that an official may not solely consider race in such circumstances.The change appears to limit the scope of the law. The previous wording left open the possibility that race could be used as a factor -- just not the sole factor -- in deciding to stop someone.In a news release issued after signing the changes to the law, Brewer said, These changes specifically answer legal questions raised by some who expressed fears that the original law would somehow allow or lead to racial profiling. These new amendments make it crystal clear and undeniable that racial profiling is illegal, and will not be tolerated in Arizona. I am proud that the Arizona Legislature has listened carefully to everyones concerns, and, in a gesture of statesmanship, acted swiftly and appropriately to lay to rest questions over the possibility of racial profiling.We wanted to judge the accuracy of Brewer's statement that the new wording will lay to rest questions over the possibility of racial profiling.This is our second attempt in a week to analyze the Arizona law. We first addressed the law in a pair of rulings on April 28, 2010, before the most recent changes were made. We'll now attempt another pair of rulings -- this one on the question of racial profiling, and a separate item on whether police need to suspect or witness something illegal before proceeding to ask someone about their immigration status.While the new phrasing on racial profiling seems straightforward -- and while the new language will provide opponents of racial profiling a useful weapon in court -- legal experts we spoke to said that it's not crystal clear and undeniable that racial profiling will be impossible under the law.Rather, the Arizona law, even in its revised version, sets up a clash of constitutional principles that could be fought over in the courts for years to come. Indeed, the law almost demands court involvement by expressly authorizing police to consider race to the extent permitted by the United States or Arizona Constitution -- something that is far from nailed down.A big reason for uncertainty is that there is Supreme Court precedent for allowing racial profiling under similar circumstances to those envisioned in the Arizona law.In 1975, the U.S. Supreme Court decided a case called United States vs. Brignoni-Ponce. In that case, a roving unit of the U.S. Border Patrol stopped a vehicle near the Mexican border and questioned the occupants about their immigration status. In this case, the court wrote, the only ground for suspicion is that the occupants appear to be of Mexican ancestry. In a 9-0 decision, the court ruled that because of the important governmental interest in preventing the illegal entry of aliens at the border, the minimal intrusion of a brief stop, and the absence of practical alternatives for policing the border, an officer, whose observations lead him reasonably to suspect that a particular vehicle may contain aliens who are illegally in the country, may stop the car briefly, question the driver and passengers about their citizenship and immigration status, and ask them to explain suspicious circumstances; but any further detention or search must be based on consent or probable cause.In the majority opinion, Justice Lewis Powell continued, The likelihood that any given person of Mexican ancestry is an alien is high enough to make Mexican appearance a relevant factor, even though standing alone it does not justify stopping all Mexican-Americans to ask if they are aliens. In other words, racial factors can be legitimately used in profiling, just as long as they are not the only factors -- language that's similar to the Arizona law's original wording.Complicating matters further, the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals -- the federal court that includes Arizona -- has issued a more restrictive ruling than the Supreme Court on the use of race in profiling. Unlike the Supreme Court, the 9th Circuit ruled that consideration of Hispanic appearance in a stop is impermissible, said Jennifer Chacon, law professor at the University of California-Irvine. This tracks closely the new language added to the law.Legal experts we spoke to said that, at a minimum, this difference of opinion sets up a judicial conflict that needs to be sorted out.In the meantime, even if racial profiling is officially banned, the new Arizona law continues to permit non-racially based profiling, such as profiling based on clothing or behavior. Yet many legal experts we spoke to saw a hazy, and perhaps unenforceable, line between permissible profiles and illegal ones.Kevin Johnson, dean of the law school at the University of California-Davis and a specialist on immigration law, said he worries that local police inadequately trained in immigration law could engage in profiling, either unwittingly or intentionally. My fear is that, with the new addition to the law or not, racial profiling will result, with untrained local law enforcement officers – perhaps unconsciously – relying on racial and/or class stereotypes when determining whether there's reasonable suspicion about one's immigration status.For defendants who feel they were stopped unfairly due to racial profiling, it may be virtually impossible to show, at least for many months if not several years that the police made their decision illegally on racial or ethnic grounds, said Stephen Saltzburg, a law professor at George Washington University. Brewer's office did not respond to a request for comment. Ultimately, the late changes do bolster Brewer's contention that the law prohibits racial profiling. But our legal experts say that it is far from the done deal that she suggests. There are simply too many legal loose ends to be settled in court to be able to say that the late changes to the law will lay to rest questions over the possibility of racial profiling, as Brewer put it. We rule Brewer's statement Barely True.",0.5,0.6,0.9,0.7069951382

But the post muddles some details of Canadas response. All schools in Canada are closed for the rest of the school year, each family will receive $950 every two weeks for the next 15 weeks, banks were notif(ied) to suspend mortgage payments for at least six months, and student loans deferred, the March 21 Facebook post says. Imagine if the United States did this, it says. The post was flagged as part of Facebooks efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) In reality, schools in Canadas provinces have not yet been shut down through the years end. The Facebook post also mischaracterized the employment insurance measures that Canada implemented to provide income support for Canadians who miss work due to the coronavirus. Canadas 10 provinces and three territories have mandated school closures with varying dates, which in some cases coincide with the term break, according to UNESCO. As of March 25, heres what each of Canadas provinces has decided for its schools: Alberta: Schools are closed until further notice. British Columbia: Schools are closed indefinitely. Manitoba: Schools are closed until at least April 10. New Brunswick: Schools are closed until at least March 30. Newfoundland and Labrador: Schools are closed indefinitely. Nova Scotia: Schools are closed until at least April 6. Ontario: Schools are closed until at least April 6. Prince Edward Island: Schools are closed until at least April 6. Quebec: Schools are closed until at least May 1. Saskatchewan: Schools are closed indefinitely. In sum, the Facebook post overstated the extent of Canadas school closures, although the situation could change. All 10 provinces have shut down schools for some length of time, but as of March 25, no province had ordered schools closed for the rest of the school year. The Facebook post also mischaracterized Canadas economic response to the coronavirus. On March 18, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced several actions, some of which were replaced in the final legislation, that the government would take to temper the economic burden faced by Canadians.  Canadians should not have to worry about paying their rent or mortgage or buying groceries because of the #COVID19 crisis. Learn how the Government of Canada is taking action to support workers and their families: https://t.co/G3Z1Ean0Mx pic.twitter.com/aukpQcOmXf For starters, the government implemented a six-month, interest-free, moratorium on Canada Student Loan payments for all individuals who are in the process of repaying these loans and secured a six-month payment deferral for mortgages, according to the press release. The government also pledged to introduce an emergency care benefit to provide pay for people who miss work due to the coronavirus and do not have access to paid sick leave. The benefit would have provided up to $900 bi-weekly for up to 15 weeks to Canadian workers who are sick, quarantined, under instructions to self-isolate or taking care of a family member or child who is sick, quarantined, self-isolating or home from school due to closures. Thats not $950 — nor is it worth the same amount in American dollars — and it would not have gone to each family every two weeks, as the Facebook post wrongly claimed. The emergency care benefit would have applied only to workers impacted by COVID-19, while an expansion of child benefits would have delivered more money to families with children. More importantly, the emergency care benefit and another proposed benefit for workers facing unemployment were eventually replaced by the Emergency Response Benefit, which will give $2,000 a month for up to four months for workers who lose their income due to COVID-19. A spokesperson for the Canadian minister of finances office directed us to a press release detailing the new and more generous benefit, which was enacted into law on March 25.  Were doing everything we can to support you right now. Because at a time like this, you should be focused on what matters most - your health and the health of those you love. Thats exactly why were announcing the new Canada Emergency Response Benefit today. ⤵️ The $2,000 per month is roughly the same as $950 every two weeks. But again, it will only apply to workers who lose income due to the coronavirus. It wont apply to each family. A government webpage detailing Canadas efforts to support individuals outlines the emergency response benefit, the six-month moratorium placed on student loans and the flexibility provided to borrowers who need to defer up to six monthly mortgage payments. A Facebook post said: All schools in Canada are closed for the rest of the school year, each family will receive $950 every two weeks for the next 15 weeks, banks were notif(ied) to suspend mortgage payments for at least six months, and student loans deferred. The post is right about mortgage payments and student loans. But it overstates the impact of Canadas new employment insurance benefits and exaggerates the extent of school closures.",0.5,0.6,1,0.663205553

It includes an individual mandate requiring people to buy coverage in order to spread risk and costs across the population. That provision in particular is the subject of numerous court challenges and is the least popular aspect of the law.Interviewer Mark Wilson pointed to that fact in the Nov. 1, 2011, interview, noting 54 percent of Americans favor repealing some version some part of that law. As you know, Florida leads the way in repealing it. What would you do differently now with regards to health care reform, knowing what we know now?Obama responded by touting some of the laws benefits.Well, look, keep in mind a million young people around the country have health care that didn't have it before because they can stay on their parents health care plan. Millions of families all across the country benefited from additional drug benefits as a consequence of that health care plan, the president said. Thirty million Americans, including a lot of people in Florida, are going to be able to get health care next year because of that law.The next year part of that struck us as suspect, so we decided to check it out.The law and its many provisions are designed to take effect in steps over a period of years. The Kaiser Family Foundation has a timeline posted on its website explaining the phase-in.The changes set to take effect in 2012 mainly involve payments to Medicare.The individual mandate, along with Medicaid expansion and establishment of the insurance exchanges, doesn't kick in until 2014. Those are the provisions of the law expected to give millions of Americans access to health insurance, and thus health care.The Congressional Budget Office estimates that next year only about 1 million more Americans will gain health insurance. The figure balloons to 19 million in 2014, and 30 million in 2016 when those concrete changes are fully implemented.Parts of the law already up and running -- which have chipped away at the number of uninsured Americans -- include policies for people with pre-existing conditions and an allowance for young adults to remain on their parents health plans up to age 26.We asked the White House what Obamas next year claim was based on but did not hear back.In addition, as weve noted before, the individual mandate faces a significant battle in the courts and is likely to end up being decided by the U.S. Supreme Court. If it is ruled unconstitutional, the CBO projects that 16 million fewer people will become insured. Other studies put that reduction at between 8 million and 24 million.Our rulingObama said Thirty million Americans, including a lot of people in Florida, are going to be able to get healthcare next year because of that law.The CBO, a nonpartisan source, predicts only 1 million people will benefit in 2012, with the significant increases coming in 2014 and 2016. Plus, the laws future is uncertain.The president is understandably enthusiastic about seeing his signature legislation take effect. But he misstated the timing of how many people will gain health insurance and when. Its not happening next year.",0.1,0.8,1,0.5462338758

Priebus took a swing at Hillary Clintons past, telling NBCs Meet the Press host Chuck Todd that her actions say a lot about her, adding shes the one that labeled African-American youth as superpredators. Trump, who is looking to increase his appeal among African-American voters, made the same superpredator claim days earlier on Twitter.  It didnt take long to find what Trump and Priebus were referencing, but for this fact-check, we wanted to take a close look at the full context of Clintons remark. Superpredators in context The superpredators line comes from a 1996 speech in New Hampshire, where Clinton spoke in support of the 1994 Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act, which her husband, Bill Clinton, had signed in to law. Were making some progress, Clinton said. Much of it is related to the initiative called community policing. Because we have finally gotten more police officers on the street. That was one of the goals that the president had when he pushed the crime bill that was passed in 1994. Provisions of the act included a ban on some assault weapons, more funding for community policing and an expansion of the death penalty. The legislation, which was championed by Bill Clinton as a way to reduce the number of African-Americans being killed in drug-related incidents, has drawn criticism in recent years for sending disproportionate numbers of African-Americans to prison. The superpredator remark, which Priebus and Trump referenced, was in the same speech a few lines later. But we also have to have an organized effort against gangs, Hillary Clinton said in a C-SPAN video clip. Just as in a previous generation we had an organized effort against the mob. We need to take these people on. They are often connected to big drug cartels, they are not just gangs of kids anymore. They are often the kinds of kids that are called superpredators — no conscience, no empathy. We can talk about why they ended up that way, but first, we have to bring them to heel. The full context of this incident does link children and superpredators, but nowhere in the speech does she directly label African-American youth this way. However, backlash from this speech has followed Clinton into this years election. Two Black Lives Matter activists confronted Clinton at a private fundraiser in February, telling the candidate she owes black people an apology. One day after this confrontation, Clinton released a statement to the Washington Posts Jonathan Capehart, expressing regret for her word choice. Looking back, I shouldn't have used those words, and I wouldn't use them today, she said. Later in the election cycle, former Democratic opponent, Bernie Sanders, also criticized her language at a debate in Brooklyn. When Sanders was asked by debate moderator why he called out Bill Clinton out for his defense of Clintons use of the term superpredator, Sanders responded, Because it was a racist term, and everyone knew it was a racist term. Our ruling Priebussaid Hillary Clinton is the the one that labeled African-American youth as superpredators. Clinton — in the midst of championing her husbands 1994 crime legislation — did use the term superpredator when referring to gangs of kids. She did not specifically label superpredators as African-American, but the context of her speech and her subsequent apology decades later suggests it was a reasonable inference.",0.6,0.4,0.9,0.6653294671

Charlie Crist said Floridians are paying far less in property taxes than they used to.Property owners were seeing double-digit percentage increases in taxes levied prior to the beginning of my administration, Crist said on March 2, 2010. Now, they have seen significant decreases over the past three years. Due to ... tax cuts and lower (property) values, 2009 property taxes were almost $3 billion below 2007 property taxes. In this item, we'll focus on whether the amount of property tax relief matches Crist's description. The relevant information to back up Crist's claim comes from a Senate committee hearing last month. In the meeting, James McAdams, the Department of Revenue's property tax oversight program director, gave an update on property tax collections across Florida.According to McAdams, Florida property taxes collected between 2007 and 2009 dropped by $2.28 billion, or 7.5 percent, the Associated Press reported.McAdams was unable to delineate how much of the drop was attributed to tax reforms implemented by the Legislature, and how much was a result of falling property values.I would classify that as dropping like a rock, said Senate Finance and Taxation Committee Chairman Thad Altman, R-Viera.Altman's comment prompted a response from Crist during his televised remarks in front of a joint session of the Legislature.Sen. Altman, we agree that does, indeed, qualify as 'dropping like a rock,'  Crist said.The Department of Revenue's 2009 annual report, meanwhile, included an even bigger reduction. The annual report said property tax collections fell from $31.04 billion in 2007, to $28.14 billion in 2009. That's a $2.9 billion decrease in three years. (See page 32 of the report).In his State of the State address, Crist said 2009 property taxes were almost $3 billion below 2007 property taxes. A report prepared for a Senate committee pegs the number at about $2.28 billion and the Department of Revenue's annual report pegs the number at $2.9 billion. With the qualifier almost, that's close enough not to distort the broader point.",0.9,0.1,0.9,0.1014306873

Jim Justice for the states jump in the rate of person-to-person transmission of the novel coronavirus. Under the leadership of @WVGovernor Justice, West Virginia now has the highest rate of COVID-19 spread from person to person than any other state, the tweet begins. The thread pointed to an announcement by Clay Marsh, the vice president and executive dean of West Virginia University Health Sciences, that the state was ranked No. 1 nationally in the rate of transmission. Today Dr. Clay Marsh announced that WV has the highest RT rate of any other state in the U.S., the thread says. This means that WV is spreading COVID-19 from person to person faster than any other state in the country. Bureau of Public Health commissioner Cathy Slemp, who resigned under pressure in late June, tried to warn Justice of this days before she was fired. 🆘😷🆘 Under the leadership of @WVGovernor Justice, West Virginia now has the highest rate of COVID-19 spread from person to person than any other state.  Does West Virginia, the last state in the country to confirm a positive COVID-19 case, now top the country in the rate of transmission? It does, though the tweet lacks important context about the spread of the virus in the state and the country as a whole. The West Virginia Democratic Party did not respond to inquiries for this article, but we did reach Marsh to discuss the relationship between the rate of transmission and the growth in coronavirus cases. He said scientists use two related but distinct measurements to study the spread infections such as COVID-19. One is R0, pronounced R-naught, and the other is known as Rt, or the effective reproduction number. Both measure how many people, on average, one infected person will infect. But they measure slightly different things. R0 captures how fundamentally infectious a germ is when its introduced into a new population. By contrast, Rt measures how much the infection is spreading at a particular moment in time, taking into account factors such as the percentage of people who have already become infected and the preventive measures being taken against the infection. With both of these scores, any rate that is more than 1 suggests that the disease is spreading, and any rate below 1 suggests that it is reducing, Marsh told PolitiFact. On July 10, the day the Democratic Partys tweet was posted, Marsh told WVMetroNews that the states Rt had increased from the nations second lowest rate two and a half months earlier to second-worst in the country. By that afternoon, CNN had posted an article citing Marsh and reporting that West Virginia had climbed to No. 1 nationally in Rt. Marsh told PolitiFact that Rt is valuable for showing which direction the states level of infections could be heading in the following weeks. But other metrics are important as well, he said. Marsh said he pays attention to the positivity rate -- the percentage of newly tested people whose results come back positive for the virus. The countries and states that have been most successful have kept this measurement below 3%, and West Virginia has toggled between 3% and 5% recently. (West Virginia is also one of only 11 states that are performing an adequate number of tests to control the spread, according to a New York Times analysis.) Marsh said he also looks at the total change in the number of cases, using a 7-day or 14-day rolling average, and how close in-state hospitals are to their capacity for the number of ICU beds and ventilators In other words, Rt gives researchers an idea about how fast the disease is spreading, but its not the only key to understanding the virus. AndyShi and Xihong Lin from the Harvard Chan School of Public Health agree with Marshs assessment in an email interview with PolitiFact. Ultimately, what we are doing is we are trying to take a look at, how do we measure today versus how did we measure a week ago, or two weeks ago, or a month ago, because that gives us a better idea about how our risk is changing, Marsh said. The West Virginia Democratic Party tweeted, Under the leadership of @WVGovernor Justice, West Virginia now has the highest rate of COVID-19 spread from person to person than any other state. On the day the tweet was posted, West Virginia did have one of the highest rates of transmission of any state. However, using this metric communicates only one part of the picture of how hard West Virginia is getting hit by the coronavirus. Among other measurements, the absolute number of coronavirus cases ranks far below the level seen in current hot-spot states like Arizona, Florida, and Texas. And the states positivity rate for test results is close to the low level that experts like to see.",0.85,0.15,0.9,0.439629328

As governor of Florida, Bush burnished his tech and public access credentials by using a personal email account to supplement the one the state provided. Prior to Clintons troubles, Bush set up a special website for the public to browse any of those emails that dealt with official business. Like Clinton, Bush himself determined which ones were private and which would be made public, but the move was largely seen as a way to mark Bush as a candidate who walks the walk when it comes to transparency. This led Democratic activist James Carville to challenge how transparent Bush really is. Jeb Bush has released 10 percent of his emails, Carville said on ABCs This Week, March 15, 2015. He had a private email server. He destroyed his emails. We decided to check Carvilles numbers. Carvilles assistant, Kees Nordin, gave PunditFact the underlying math. The fact is that of Jeb Bush's 3 million emails (public and private) he's only released 275,000 or just under 10 percent, Nordin said. According to Bushspokeswoman Kristy Campbell, Bush posted nearly 280,000 emails from his personal email account on a website he set up, jebbushemails.com. Back in 2007, Bush gave an off-the-cuff estimate that during his eight years in office he received about 550,000 emails at his personal address emailprotected. We tried to confirm that number, but Campbell said Its immaterial as they are not subject to public records request and not required by law to be retained. In the same interview in 2007, Bush said an additional 2.5 million emails came through other email accounts run by the state. So this is how Carville gets to a grand total of 3 million emails. The question is, did Bush reveal just 275,000 -- or 280,000 -- of them? The answer is no, because most of them have been, and remain, publicly available. Under Florida law, most of Bush's emails to his government accounts are a public record and accessible to people who request them, said Barbara Petersen, president of Floridas First Amendment Foundation. (The First Amendment Foundation advocates for government transparency and receives major support from foundations and Floridas news organizations, including the Tampa Bay Times.) Anything relating to public business is a public record in Florida, Petersen said. If you comment on a policy, even if the rest of the email is personal, it will be subject to a public records request. Its a fairly broad definition. Importantly, all of the emails sent to accounts run by the state would have been seen and vetted by state workers, not private staffers or lawyers employed by Bush. They remain the custodian of those records, andPetersen said shebelieves most of the Bush emails from his official accounts have been retained. The first stop for those emails would be the Citizen Services office, which fields all incoming communications to the governor. While some emails might be purely personal or otherwise exempt and would not be released, they were still part of the states public record. The point being, only the 550,000 emails sent to Bushs personal account would have remained under his exclusive control. The rest remain housed with the state government. What's the point? We can confidently say that the 280,000 emails on the Bush website represent just a fraction of the total number of emails that are public. While the precise figures are unclear, if 2.5 million emails went to one of the state-run email accounts then all of those were subject to a public records request. So in a rough sense, close to 90 percent of the universe of 3 million emailsare public in some form. If you look at just Bush's private emails, about 50 percent are public. Neither number is close to the one Carville cited. We reached out to state officials to see if they can add any information about the number of officialemails thatare part of Bush's record. Wewill update this item if we learn further details. A few notes Carville said Bush had a private email server. According to press reports, Bush used a server located in the governor's office. He took the server with him when he left office. Carville also said Bush destroyedthe emails he hadnt revealed. We asked how he knew that and got no reply.Petersen had the same question and noted that Florida law presents a hurdle to destroying emails. If you made a public record request of Jebs email and you thought you didn't get them all, you can file suit in civil court and request an in camera inspection by a judge, she said. Petersen said the state judges which records have archival value and which ones are trivial and can be disposed. Our ruling Carville said that Bush revealed 10 percent of his emails and he destroyed his emails. The numbers dont add up. The numbers used by Carville himself include 2.5 million emails sent to state run accounts. Those emails are subject to a public records request. It is completely inaccurate to say that Bush only revealed 275,000 or 280,000 emails out of a total of 3 million. A more accurate reading would be that he revealed about half of the emails sent to his private account, and the rest were already available to the press, although some might be held back if they were strictly personal in nature.",0.6,0.4,1,0.9731145652

He was struggling a bit as he made his point, but here's what he said:Obama gave the Muslim Brotherhood a million then correcting himself a billion and a half dollars last week, you know, in Egypt. We need that money here. A billion and a half dollars could really help Rhode Island, quite frankly. We probably need it, in my opinion, more than the Muslim Brotherhood needs it . . . especially when the Muslim Brotherhood got together, I think one of the first things they did, when they convened their new congress, was to make Israel enemy #1. And we give them a billion and a half dollars? That's a problem in my book. We need to focus our resources here.The Muslim Brotherhood has been a part of Egyptian politics -- sometimes an outlawed part -- since 1928; one of its goals is to promote Sharia law, which is the moral code and religious law of Islam.Did the Obama administration really give the Brotherhood $1.5 billion?It turns out that the money was actually an aid package to Egypt itself, not the Brotherhood, according to a March 22 story in The Washington Post.We contacted Hinckley's campaign.Spokesman Christopher McAuliffe said Hinckley is aware that there is a pro forma difference between the Muslim Brotherhood and the government of Egypt. In that light, his position could certainly have been more precise. However, I do think the basis of it is readily understandable, since the Egyptian government is dominated by the Muslim Brotherhood.For guidance on that point, we contacted some experts on Egypt.Melani Cammett, director of the Middle East studies program at Brown University, told us that sending aid to Egypt was not the same as giving it to the Brotherhood because the Brotherhood doesn't actually control the government.It's true that the Muslim Brotherhood won the plurality of seats in December elections and when you combine them with the Salafis, which are more radical Islamists, they've won the majority of seats in the parliament, she said. The fact of the matter is the SCAF, which is the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces, still controls the government and controls the executive branch and is manipulating things in such a way that it's making it difficult for the Islamists to exert their full power as the majority in parliament.So the major struggle going on in Egyptian politics right now is that the SCAF, controlled by elite military officers, is not willing to relinquish power, said Cammett.John P. Entelis, director of Middle East studies at Fordham University, said it would be totally inaccurate to say that $1.5 billion is going to the Muslim Brotherhood. This is an ongoing military aid package that we've been giving to Egypt since 1979.The aid package, according to multiple sources, includes $1.3 billion in military aid and $250 million in economic and political assistance.Our rulingRepublican U.S. Senate candidate Barry Hinckley said the Obama administration approved $1.5 billion to go to Egypt's Muslim Brotherhood.In fact, the aid package was for the nation of Egypt, not the Brotherhood. The Brotherhood may control the largest bloc of seats in parliament, but it's not even a majority. Not only that, the country itself continues, for now at least, to be controlled by the military. And more than 80 percent of the aid package is military aid.(Get updates from PolitiFactRI on Twitter.

Will participated in a Fox News Sunday political panel dissecting the NFLs response to the video showing Rice, a former Baltimore Ravens running back, assaulting his now-wife in an elevator. NFL Commissioner Roger Goodells performance has been widely criticized, but Will predicted he will survive the scandal. Why? Americas real pastime is an economic behemoth that cant be stopped. Last weeks three most-viewed television programs were Sunday Night Football, Thursday Night Football and Monday Night Football, he said. And money talks and it will continue to talk. And this will pass over, and football will go on its merry way. Its no secret that professional football has a big TV audience. We wanted to know just how big. By the numbers To check Wills claim we looked to a top-10 ranking of shows by the Nielsen Company, which tracks consumer trends, including television viewership, from the week of Monday, Sept. 8, through Sunday, Sept. 14. It is the most-recent week available. That Monday, TMZ released a video showing Rice punching his now-wife in an elevator. On the same day, the Baltimore Ravens terminated their contract with Rice, and Goodell announced that Rice was on indefinite suspension. Later in the week, the Associated Press reported that NFL executives were supposedly aware of this video months earlier. Nielsen has separate top-10 lists for broadcast television and cable television. Because Monday Night Football appears on ESPN, we decided to combine the lists into one overall ranking. Here are the top 10 shows and their viewership (in millions) that week: 1. NBC Sunday Night Football (22.1) 2. CBS Thursday Night Football (20.8) 3. NBC Sunday Night NFL Pre-Kick show (16.7) 4. CBS NFL Thursday Night Pre-Kick show (13.9) 5. ESPN Monday Night Football - New York/Detroit (13.7) 6. CBS60 Minutes (12.3) 7. NBC Football Night in America (12.4) 8. ESPN Monday Night Football - San Diego/Arizona (11.5) 9. CBS NFL Thursday Night Kickoff (10.6) 10. CBS Americas Got Talent (10.5) As you can see, theres a lot of love for professional football. Americans dont just love the games -- they love the pregame shows, too. The popularity of the pregame shows on NBC and CBS pushed the Monday Night Football game between the New York Giants and Detroit Lions to No. 5. So Wills comment, by Nielsens metrics, is a tad off. Still, the point holds: Pro football games and pre- and post-game analysis dominated 8 out of 10 of the top 10 shows. Only CBS Americas Got Talent and 60 Minutes cracked the list. Of course, excitement for NFL games is high since the season started just a couple weeks ago, and the networks fall television programming hasnt fully kicked in just yet. Even so, NFL games and analysis will continue to dominate the rankings as the season goes on, said Marc Berman, editor-in-chief of TV Media Insights, in an interview with PunditFact. When new shows begin to air, the number of households using television goes up, but they dont take viewers away from football, Berman said. The popularity of the teams playing and whether the game is exciting have a bigger effect on football viewership ratings. Numerous Nielsen statistics show professional footballs seemingly permanent first-place spot. In the 2013-14 season, NBCs Sunday Night Football was the most-watched primetime show, with 21.7 million average viewers. ESPNs Monday Night Football was the No. 1 most-viewed cable television show in 2013. The NFL holds 34 of the 35 most-watched individual shows in the fall of 2013. (The odd one out was NBCs Macys Thanksgiving Parade at No. 22.) And in four of the past five years, the Super Bowl has broken the record for the most-watched television event in history. Professional football stands out from other sports, said Dan Lebowitz, executive director of Northeastern Universitys Center for the Study of Sports and Society. In football, there are only 16 games in a typical season -- as opposed to baseballs 162 games and basketballs 82 games -- so each game becomes a major event. The rise of fantasy football has further solidified the sports popularity, Lebowitz said. The scandals involving Rice and other NFL standoutscant make even a small dent in this trend because of footballs widespread popularity and importance in American culture, Berman said. Football will outlive all of us, he said. Our ruling Will said, Last weeks three most-viewed television programs were Sunday Night Football, Thursday Night Football and Monday Night Football. Football games and related programming accounted for eight of the top 10 most-viewed TV programs between Sept. 8-14, 2014. Even though Monday Night Football came in fifth, not third, Will was right to say that football dominated the rankings. Experts say it will continue to do just that.",0.87,0.13,1,0.006899458165

Sen. Dan Sullivan, R-Alaska,says one of the best moves the United States could make is to accelerate the shift in places such as China and India from coal to natural gas. Sullivan has a plan to increase American natural gas production, liquify it and ship it overseas. His key supporting argument is the hefty 14% drop in American carbon dioxide emissions over the last 15 years. If every other country in the world had a record like this, where do you think we would be on global emissions? Sullivan said at a March 23 Senate hearing. We are the leader in the world by far. Whether the U.S. is the world leader in cutting emissions depends on how you measure things. In total metric tons, Sullivan is right. But in relative terms, many economic peers achieved steeper declines. At the Senate hearing, Sullivan displayed a chart showing the change in carbon dioxide emissions in nine countries between 2005 and 2020. The U.S. stands out with a fall between those years of 970 million metric tons of carbon dioxide. Japans emissions went down 237 million metric tons. China, on the other hand, released an additional 4,689 million metric tons in 2020 than it did in 2005, while Indias emissions rose 1,315 million metric tons. Chart used by Sen. Dan Sullivan, R-Alaska, to show carbon dioxide emission trends for nine countries. (Office of Dan Sullivan) Sullivans staff pulled these numbers from the website Our World in Data, a reliable resource based at the University of Oxford in England. The numbers are accurate, although climate trackers warn against including 2020 numbers, because the COVID-19 economic shutdown distorted normal emission patterns. In our analysis, we looked at 2005 to 2019. The first caveat to Sullivans approach is that he uses absolute numbers. Rob Jackson, an earth systems professor at Stanford University, said the chart is conveniently misleading. The United States has the largest reduction because, in 2005, Jackson said, it had the highest emissions. Other countries, in Europe in particular, have done far more than we have to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, Jackson said. Looking at the percentage change in carbon dioxide emissions, the United Kingdom made the greatest progress, with a reduction of 35%. Italy, France and Germany came next. The United States and Japan tied for fifth place with reductions of about 14%.  Sullivan spokesman Ben Dietderich agreed that the relative changes reshuffled the rankings, but he countered that the absolute number of tons mattered most. Its the tons of carbon dioxide that affect the global climate, he said. At the end of the day, Dietderich said, the United States made the largest contribution to reducing carbon dioxide emissions. Jackson raised another issue with Sullivans chart — it left out emissions per person. Chinas emissions are enormous, but the country also has 1.4 billion people. Viewed through that lens, despite the decline in U.S. emissions, the United States remained the larger emitter per capita. Our per capita emissions are still twice Chinas and eight times higher than Indias, Jackson said.  Sullivans focus on carbon dioxide doesnt give the full picture of American emissions. There are other greenhouse gases, most importantly methane and nitrous oxide. The same website that provided the carbon dioxide numbers also has data for greenhouse gases across the board. Factoring in all greenhouse gases, the U.S. trends are less dramatic. The total decline goes from a reduction of 879 million metric tons to 607 million metric tons. As a percentage, the decline goes from 14.3% for carbon dioxide alone to 9.5% for all greenhouse gases combined. The numbers work that way because it doesnt take much of those other gases to put a lot of carbon into the air. Although natural gas was the single largest factor in cutting U.S. emissions, major contributions also came from the rise in wind power and efficiency gains in American industry that lowered demand. Sullivans point was that if other countries followed the United States lead, global emissions would fall. Since the blossoming of natural gas production played a large role in the U.S., it makes sense, he said, to expand production further and export to coal-burning countries such asChina and India. Not so fast, say energy researchers. Michael Young, a senior scientist at the University of Texas at Austin, said building the pipelines and processing plants to send natural gas overseas adds carbon to the atmosphere. Its possible, Young said, that exports to Asia could reduce emissions there if they replaced coal or wood. But its also true that liquified natural gas from the U.S. will embed carbon dioxide emissions in the production and transportation of the fuel, reducing the benefits, Young said. Whether the two balance out depends on many factors. Ben King, a senior analyst at Rhodium Group, a private research center, said although industry is getting better at preventing the release of methane gas, it still happens in the liquefaction process. More troubling, King said, is that building new plants to export natural gas is a 30-year investment. Locking in long-lived fossil fuel assets runs directly counter to the need, recently affirmed in the latest International Panel on Climate Change report, to quickly transition away from uncontrolled fossil fuel use, King said. Sullivan said the United States is the leader in the world by far in cutting greenhouse gas emissions. In absolute terms, that is accurate —but it isnt telling the full story. Relative to the scale of emissions in other leading economies, other countries show much deeper reductions. Sullivan also left out emissions per person in the United States. Although those have dropped, theyre still about twice as high as they are in China.",0.6,0.4,0.9,0.0565399665

False Confidence (between 0 and 1): 0.05",I cut spending while serving in the state Legislature,"The cornerstone for any Republican seeking to be the next U.S. Representative for New Hampshires Second Congressional District is to come across as an authentic, fiscal conservative. And soon after Salem Republican state Rep. Marilinda Garcia announced that she would enter the Second District race, she touted her cost-cutting chops. I cut spending while serving in the state Legislature and will take that much-needed experience to Washington, Garcia, 30, declared in one of her first post-announcement statements on her Twitter account. The Telegraph and PolitiFact New Hampshire sought to determine the accuracy of that statement. State budget votes Garcia was first elected to the New Hampshire House in 2006 and was a backbencher when Democrats took control of the 400-member body for the first time in nearly a century. Garcia lost her reelection bid in 2008, but quickly won her seat back in a 2009 special election. Initially, Garcia served on the House Children and Family Law Committee, the panel that oversees divorce, adoption and custody but has essentially no direct impact on state spending matters. Claiming to cut spending is a pretty broad statement, but well start with the major vote New Hampshire legislators take to increase or cut spending -- consideration of the states biennial budget. When Garcia was sworn in on Jan. 3, 2007, the state budget set by her fellow Republicans was $9.3 billion. The subsequent $9.7 billion budget, called for a 4 percent increase for fiscal years 2008 and 2009 was written primarily by Democrats. Garcia voted against it. The next $11.5 billion budget, also written by Democrats, called for a hefty 19 percent increase in spending for fiscal years 2010 and 2011. Garcia also voted against that. And the next state budget, crafted by conservative Republicans, including Garcia,after the GOP took over the chamber, cut back spending by more than a billion dollars to $10.3 billion. That budget plan was the first reduction in absolute dollars since World War II. Garcia voted in favor of that budget. Finally, the most recent $11 billion budget, covering fiscal years 2013 and 2014 and written by a Democratic majority, restored some of the cuts made in the previous budget. Garcia again voted no, though she said he didnt mind restoringcuts to higher education, public safety and programs for troubled children. I thought with existing recovery of revenues we could add back some of those items, Garcia said in response to our inquiry about her record of cutting spending. Instead, she said she voted against it because of the removal of the Certificate of Need program that approves all construction projects for hospitals. I wanted to see those health care reforms in place, but they got taken out, so that's why I voted against it, Garcia said. Still, her budget votes while in the House are fairly consistent: Shes voted against every budget that called for an increase in spending and supported the one that cut spending. Other spending Reviewing Garcias entire, seven-year voting record and the bills she sponsored, Garcia consistently supportedpolicies that would cut spending and taxes. In 2011, she voted to cut the taxes on hotel room rentals and meals and tobacco. She endorsed making it easier for local governments to adopt spending caps and supported banning higher-education spending on New Hampshire Public Television. Last year she opposed raising state taxes on gasoline and tobacco. In addition, in 2011, Garcia voted for a bill to require agencies propose every two years how they would live with 10 percent cut in state spending. And in 2012, Garcia voted in favor of business tax breaks totaling more than $10 million a year. She did vote in favor of one bill that could have increased spending at the local level. She voted for House Bill 1305 in 2012 that would have reinstated an exemption from property taxes for telephone and communication company poles and conduits. Critics said this could have led to raising local property taxes $5 million to $6 million statewide to make up the difference. The GOP-led House killed the bill 166-133, with Garcia on the losing end. Does she deserve credit for cutting spending? When politicians claim credit for something that happens on their watch, we consider whether that credit is justified before we give the statement a Truth-O-Meter rating. In Garcias case, she is a legislator, not an executive, so she cant unilaterally cut spending. And much of the time, she has been in the minority. However, during the one session in which she served in the majority, she can make a plausible claim for deserving credit for lower spending. In April 2011, then-House Speaker William O'Brien, a Republican, appointed Garcia to the House Finance Committee. She served on the committee when the state faced an $800 million budgetary hole caused by overly optimistic revenue projections. We solved it not by raising taxes but by cutting in a responsible way, Garcia said. At least one fellow Republican agrees. Former House Chief of Staff Gregory Moore said that when it comes to budgets, there are three kinds of legislators: Those who believe in smaller government, those who believe in more government and those who are pragmatic on the question from issue to issue. From the outset, Marilinda Garcia came from the first camp. Our ruling Garcia said, I cut spending while serving in the state Legislature. Her voting record on the state budget -- which comprises any legislators biggest impact on state spending -- show that Garcia voted against every budget that increased spending and voted in favor of the OBrien budget that cut state spending for the first time since World War II. We found two minor asterisks. Even though she voted against the most recent state budget, she didnt oppose it because it increased spending -- she opposed it because of how it treated a program that governs hospital construction and expansion. And she supported a bill on telephone and communication company poles and conduits that would have had the effect of raising taxes.Still, there are few, if any, votes shes taken that would have increased spending or increased the size of government.",0.85,0.2,0.9,0.2863762488

Charlie Crist says. You know, I have had the challenge during this administration to suspend no less than 37 public officials in about 36 months, Crist told reporters gathered in Tallahassee on Jan. 27, 2010. It's pretty stunning, and it's pretty disappointing. The Florida Constitution enables Crist, as governor, to suspend any elected public official indicted for a crime and remove public officials from office who are convicted. The governor also can suspend state or county officials -- anyone from people appointed to state or local boards or even public notaries -- for misconduct. Is Crist really on a suspension-a-month pace? We asked the governor's office for a list of people suspended by the governor since he took office in January 2007. Officials provided a seven-page document listing 38 names and titles of people they say the governor has suspended or removed from public office. Each entry includes a corresponding charge and points to an executive order codifying the action. (You can read the governor's document for yourself.) The list includes some familiar names: *No. 28 -- James Bob Richburg, the former Northwest Florida State College president. Richburg was suspended from the board of directors of Workforce Florida in April 2009 after being indicted in the case involving former House Speaker Ray Sansom. Sansom has been accused of falsely securing $6 million in taxpayer money to construct a college building that would double as an aircraft hangar for a friend and major Republican donor. * No. 35 -- Scott Rothstein. Rothstein was suspended from a judicial nominating committee after agreeing to be permanently disbarred. A major political fundraiser, Rothsteinpleaded guilty on Jan. 27, 2010, to five counts of racketeering, fraud and money laundering as part of a $1.2 billion Ponzi scheme. * No. 34 and No. 38 -- Miami City Commissioner Michelle Spence-Jones. Spence-Jones was suspended by Crist in November 2009 after being arrested on charges that she redirected $50,000 in county funds to a now-defunct family business. She won her seat back in a special election in January 2010. She was immediately suspended again. The list also includes people probably unfamiliar to most, including eight notary publics. The notary publics, who are considered state officers under Florida law, were suspended in most cases for notarizing signatures and documents improperly. Examining the full list, we found some problems: * Beverly Gallagher,a member of the Broward County School Board, is listed wrongly both as No. 30 and 32. Her entries point to two different executive orders -- one that removes her from office, and one that removes someone else. Gallagher and Broward County Commissioner Josephus Eggelletion (No. 31 on the governor's list) were arrested in September on federal corruption charges, accused of taking bribes. * Gregory Burke is both No. 7 and No. 25. Burke, a commissioner of the South Walton County Mosquito Control District, was first suspended from office Dec. 13, 2007, then removed by Crist on Dec. 24, 2008 -- hence the two separate entries. * Two officials -- Miami City Commissioner Johnny Lee Winton and Hollywood City Commissioner Kenneth Wasserstrom -- were removed from office by Crist but actually suspended by Gov. Jeb Bush. * Another official, Miramar City Commissioner Fitzroy Salesman, appears on the list twice. The first entry was from March 2007, when he was reinstated into office by Crist (he had been suspended by Bush). Salesman was then suspended by Crist in December 2007 after being arrested. * No. 20, Johnny Green, was suspended from the Cross City water board after being charged with one count of conspiracy to commit bribery, according to the governor's office. Green's entry appears to note that the suspension was dissolved by Executive Order 08-235, but that order actually acknowledges a judicial vacancy in the 17th Judicial Circuit. The governor's list also includes one person who has returned to office and appears to overlook another person the governor suspended in 2008. John Scanlon, a commissioner with the Fort Myers Beach Fire Control District, was suspended after drug charges, but reinstated after completion of a pretrial diversion program. And James Roy Paul, superintendent of the Escambia County School District, was suspended from office by the governor in June 2008 after being charged with driving under the influence. But he was not on the governor's list. Where does all of that bring us in the accounting? First, we excluded the double reference to Gallagher and the entry reinstating Salesman. That drops us to 36. We then added Paul, who was not on the governor's list. Back to 37. We then double-checked that everyone on that list had been in fact suspended. We relied on the governor's online repository of executive orders, and when that didn't help, news accounts. When both options failed, as it did in one case, we asked the governor's office for the executive order directly. Then there was the case of three officials (Winton, Wasserstrom, Burke) whom Crist removed from office. You can make an argument that reduces the number of suspensions to 34. Crist told reporters he has had to suspend no less than 37 public officials since taking office in 2007. He's just about right on. The number actually includes people Cristremoved from office, a more severe punishment than suspension. And the final number includes the suspensions of eight public notaries -- not what most people think of when they hear public official.

JoeManchin too often stands against President Donald Trump. Referring to Trumps appointee to the Supreme Court, Morrisey said, If Joe Manchin had his way, Judge (Neil) Gorsuch never would have been able to get a vote in the Senate. Morrisey went on to say, Whether we're talking judicial picks, whether we're talking Trump tax cuts, whether we're talking unwillingness to change the failed Obamacare ... Joe Manchin has not stood with President Trump. Manchins support for Trump (or lack thereof) is likely to be a major campaign wedge for Morrisey, since Trump is more popular in West Virginia than any other state, according to state-by-state approval ratings released by Gallup in January 2018. Morrisey is right that Manchin voted against the tax bill supported by Trump and most Republicans. But he isnt really right about Manchins positionon Gorsuch. You may not realize this, but as a nonprofit news organization,we depend on — and answer to — you. Your support directly impactsour abilility to provide objective reporting on issues that matter.Donate to our Spring Campaign. Go on the record as saying facts matter! Here, well look at Manchins actions on the Gorsuch nominations; we looked at his positions on Obamacare in a separate fact-check. Bottom line: When it counted, Manchin voted with Republicans to advance Gorsuchs nomination. Morriseys camp pointed to three votes on April 6, 2017, during the back-and-forth over Gorsuch when Manchin voted with most Democrats. In two cases, Manchin voted in favor of efforts by Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., to adjourn before voting on the Gorsuch nomination or to postpone it. (Both failed along party lines.) In the third vote, Manchin voted not to invoke the nuclear option, which is a procedural move to lower the number of votes required to advance to a final vote from 60 to a simple majority. In this case, too, Manchin voted with all Democrats and against all Republicans. However, citing only these three votes paints a misleading picture of Manchins actions. In the most important votes for securing Gorsuch a floor vote, Manchin sided with Gorsuch and Republicans — and hed telegraphed it. Before the final showdown began, Manchin on March 27, 2017, became the first Democratic senator to publicly break with others in his party and say hed side with Republicans by committing to vote in favor of proceeding to Gorsuchs nomination. By announcing his intention to support a vote for Gorsuch a full 10 days before the final action, he sent a signal to other Democrats who still might have been deciding on what to do. And Manchin stuck to his word: On April 6, Manchin was one of only four Democrats to vote to invoke cloture and proceed to a final vote on Gorsuchs nomination. After Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., successfully invoked the nuclear option, the Senate once again voted on cloture, this time needing only a simple majority. Once again, Manchin voted to proceed to Gorsuchs nomination on April 6, this time becoming one of only three Democrats to side with every Republican on the vote. Finally, on the actual vote on Gorsuchs nomination on April 7, Manchin voted in favor, once again making him one of just three Democrats to back Gorsuch in the final vote. Senate specialist Gregory Koger of the University of Miami said Manchin has the better argument than Morrisey in this case. Ordinarily I would place real weight on procedural votes, such as adjournment and on the nuclear option precedent, he said, but I think there were extenuating circumstances, at least on the precedent vote, and the early public support for Gorsuch more than compensates for these procedural votes. Morrisey said, If Joe Manchin had his way, Judge Gorsuch never would have been able to get a vote. Manchin did side with Democrats on certain procedural votes during the showdown over Gorsuch. But he broadcast his support for a vote on Gorsuch early enough to persuade fence-sitters, and on the main votes, he broke ranks with his party, siding with Republicans to secure Gorsuch a vote and ultimately confirm him to the court.",0.2,0.8,0.9,0.7442803468

After a reader asked us to check Rollins claim, Joshua Trevino, a foundation spokesman, pointed us to information the foundation culled from the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics monthly employment data — specifically, figures from the Current Employment Statistics series, which is calculated using a broad survey of employer payroll data. First, the foundation identified those states where the number of jobs had grown between January 2006 and January 2011. There were only 10 states in that group. Texas ranked No. 1, with an increase of 545,900 jobs, from about 9.93 million to about 10.47 million. The other nine states, ranging in size from Louisiana to Wyoming, had a combined jobs increase of 183,700. However, that's not to say jobs werent lost in Texas during those years. Employment numbers fluctuate. At the states most recent peak, in August 2008, Texas had about 10.64 million jobs. About a year later, with the recession in full swing, Texas had about 400,000 less. Next, we asked the Texas Workforce Commission about the foundations claim. Lisa Givens, an agency spokeswoman, sent us a 50-state comparison of job growth also using monthly BLS figures. However, Givens accounting covered a more recent five-year period, March 2006 to March 2011 — numbers for which were still preliminary. Nine states, including Texas, had more jobs in March 2011 than in that month five years earlier. And Texas gains far outpaced the combined total for the other states: 539,500 vs. 134,400. So, the foundations figures stand up — in the way that such figures are often analyzed, including by PolitiFact. Unsaid is that this gauge defines job creation as a net increase in employment. That means the foundations analysis only takes into account the number of jobs created in excess of the number lost over a five-year period. But new jobs also sprung up in the other 40 states, although they were offset by greater losses. Is it fair to assess job creation without including them? Weve gone back and forth on that question. Rick Perry that Texas had created more than 850,000 jobs, more than all the other states combined. To come up with that number, Perrys campaign also looked at net job growth, although over a longer time period: January 2001 to June 2010. During our research of the Perry statement, Cheryl Abbot, a BLS economist in Dallas, told us that the governors statement was correct. We touched base with her again on the foundations TV statement, which she said has a legitimate basis.S. from November 2007-2008 were in Texas. We found that the Texas Workforce Commission, like the Texas Public Policy Foundation, had restricted its comparison to the states that experienced a net increase in employment; during the specified time period, there were 14 total, including Texas. While we researched that item, Michael Brandl, a senior lecturer at the University of Texas McCombs School of Business, told us that excluding all those states with net job losses — and disregarding any jobs gained in those states — exaggerates the Texas share of total new jobs in the U.S. To say it's misleading is to be kind, Brandi said. It's just not true. The Truth-O-Meter score so far: one ruling that favors net increases in employment as a valid gauge of job creation — and one that doesnt. Seeking more clarity, we turned to Jason Faberman, a senior economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia who has written an article on the BLS data sources. He agreed that it could be misleading to consider only net increases in jobs as job creation. But, he said, the public is accustomed to hearing it discussed that way. When most policy, political and media people refer to jobs created or added, they are referring to the net gain in employment over some period, Faberman said. Givens, at the workforce commission, told us that when the agency refers to net employment gains, it says jobs were added rather than created. What happens if you look at total jobs created, not just the net gain? Then Texas is no longer No. 1. The BLS keeps annual data, starting from April 1 each year, on total private sector job gains and losses. During the most recent three years — 2008, 2009 and 2010 — California gained an average of 1.3 million jobs annually, while Texas posted an average of 935,000 jobs. However, California also lost an average of 1.8 million jobs while Texas lost 992,000. However, Abbot cautioned that gross job numbers generally reflect a states population, meaning that big states would post bigger numbers than small ones. Theres no way that a Kansas could compare with a Texas, Abbot said. Faberman agreed that comparing gross job gains isnt the best way to fact-check the foundations statement. Instead, he suggested comparing Texas net employment change with that of the whole country, minus Texas share. What we found: In January 2011, the United States, excluding Texas, had 5.3 million fewer jobs than it did in January 2006 — the five-year period used by the foundation. That compares with the 545,900 increase that Texas experienced during that time. So, by Fabermans measure, Texas outperformed the rest of the country. We came across another way of thinking about job creation in an Aug. 24 blog on the Houston Chronicles website. According to the post, an unidentified economist noted that any raw job count would naturally favor Texas in a comparison with other net-gain states and asked what would happen if the size of the states job forces were factored in. The Chronicle did that by calculating the percentage increase in the states jobs between July 2009 and July 2010, and Texas still came out on top — but barely. Inspired by the Chronicle, we looked again at the 10 states with net job gains over the last five years. Texas gains represented a 5.5 percent increase in employment from January 2006 to January 2011. For the nine other states, their total increase of 183,700 jobs was a 2.5 percent increase. However, comparing the states individually, two had larger percentage increases than Texas: North Dakota (10.6 percent) and Alaska (5.7 percent). Another factor that changes — even reverses — the job creation numbers is the time frame. The longer the time frame, the better Texas numbers look. Comparing employment in a single month in 2006 with the same month five years later, Texas job numbers grow. Shorten the time period to three years, and Texas shows a net loss in jobs, going from 10.56 million jobs in January 2008 to 10.47 million in January 2011. So whats our (latest) ruling on job creation? The foundations claim that Texas created more jobs than all other states combined stands up — considering only those states that had net job gains over five years. Thats the methodology usually used to define job creation in public discourse. But the foundations analysis disregards the 40 states where millions of jobs were created but were outnumbered by losses. And looking at the percentage increase in jobs relative to the size of each states work force — another telling statistic — two other states experienced greater gains than Texas.",0.7,0.4,0.8,0.3873421987

The decision was a victory for supporters of religious freedom and a defeat for backers of expanded reproductive health care. The unveiling of the decision on June 30, 2014, produced widespread commentary and debate over its merits. Associate Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburgs stinging dissent attracted wide attention from those who opposed the majority opinion. We noticed the following claim in Ginsburgs dissent: Women of childbearing age spend 68 percent more in out-of-pocket health care costs than men. We thought it would be interesting to see how that statistic was calculated. But when we looked into it, we were in for a surprise: The 68 percent figure was a lot older than wed expected. Where the statistic came from In her dissent, Ginsburg cited the statistic as being from a statement of Sen. Feinstein, which appears to refer to a Senate floor speech by Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif. During the debate on President Barack Obamas Affordable Care Act in December 2009, Feinstein said, The fact is, women have different health needs than men, and these needs often generate additional costs. Women of childbearing age spend 68 percent more in out-of-pocket health care costs than men. Most people don't know that, but it is actually true. The 68 percent statistic has been cited repeatedly in the judicial debate over the contraceptive mandate in the health care law. In the Hobby Lobby case alone, it was cited in briefs by the Obama administration, as well as in an amicus, or friend-of-the-court, brief by 91 Democratic members of Congress and a separate amicus brief by the National Womens Law Center. We found a flurry of references to the statistic in court cases, bills, and reports in 2014, 2013, 2012, 2009, 2003, 2002, 1999 and 1998. After a lot of digging, PolitiFact was able to trace the 68 percent figure back to a publication released by the Womens Research & Education Institute titled, Women's Health Care Costs and Experiences. That study was published in 1994 -- and if 1994 was the publication year, its reasonable to assume that the data in question are even older than that. (We couldnt find the full report online, and inquiries to the group and to the original author were not answered.) Is there newer data? Could Ginsburg -- or anyone else who cited the 68 percent statistic in recent years -- have used more up-to-date data? Yes. PolitiFact asked officials at the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality -- a part of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services -- to walk us through the data in the Medical Expenditures Panel Survey, which is the source several independent experts had suggested we use to test Ginsburgs statistic. It turns out that for 2011, women between 18 and 44 had out-of-pocket expenses that averaged 69 percent higher than men of the same age range. Thats virtually indistinguishable from what Ginsburg said. Still, its worth noting that alternative data comes up with somewhat lower estimates. Data from a different HHS source -- National Health Expenditure Accounts -- found that in 2010, women between 19 and 44 had 52 percent greater out-of-pocket spending than men of the same age range. And an annual study by the Health Care Cost Institute, which is based on information supplied by private health insurance companies, found an even smaller gender gap. In 2012, women's out-of-pocket expenses were 36 percent higher than men's. However, this figure is for all women through age 65, rather than just childbearing age, so its not an apples-to-apples comparison. The experts we checked with didnt doubt that women of childbearing age tend to pay more out of their pocket for health care. Women under 65 use a lot more health services than do men, especially preventive care, screenings and well-care, all of which is covered less by insurance than hospital expenditures, said Gail Wilensky, who headed Medicare and Medicaid under President George H.W. Bush. Still, there are indications that the gap is narrowing between men and women, perhaps because the insurance market has changed substantially over the past 20-plus years, with cost-sharing becoming much more significant than it was in 1994. The annual Kaiser Family Foundation/Health Research & Educational Trust study found a rising percentage of workers with employer-provided health coverage facing an annual deductible of $1,000 or more. The share of people in that category rose from 10 percent in 2006 to 38 percent in 2013 -- a far shorter time horizon than 20 years. Meanwhile, data from HHS national accounts series shows that out-of-pocket spending for men grew faster than it did for women between 2002 and 2010 -- a 3.9 percent growth rate for men, compared with 3.3 percent for women, Tanner said. The significance of an old statistic We cant be 100 percent sure that by citing Feinstein, Ginsburg was simply relying on a very old statistic without further checking. However, given the long history of the identical number being used, we suspect the statistic was repeated, in most or all cases, without being checked against more recent data. Ginsburg did not respond to an inquiry for this story sent through the Supreme Courts public information office; justices rarely if ever comment to the media. In any case, we found repeated mentions of this statistic by advocates, lawmakers and government officials without citing the original 1994 source, leaving the incorrect impression that the number was current. Our ruling Ginsburg wrote that women of childbearing age spend 68 percent more in out-of-pocket health care costs than men. Some estimates cited by a litany of politicians and advocates are based on 20-year-old data. But more recent data shows that women do still pay more out of pocket for health care than men do, with one estimate very close -- 69 percent -- and other estimates in the 40 percent to 50 percent range.",0.8,0.2,1,0.597997203

Current survival rate for COVID19 in the US is 98.54%. Lets share this story. Positive vs. Panic, it reads. The post, which was shared in mid-April, was flagged as part of Facebooks efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The figure isnt too far off from what databases are reporting right now in terms of the known fatality rate from the disease. But the figures from this developing pandemic are preliminary, and its important to note that the best calculations include people who are still sick — patients who have neither died nor recovered. Also, while a 98.5% survival rate might sound promising, it really isnt. Even a 1% mortality rate (99% survival rate) would mean that a disease is 10-times more lethal than the seasonal flu. If everyone in the country contracted COVID-19, that rate would lead to about 3,300,000 American deaths. Lets look at the numbers. Our World in Data, a collaboration between researchers at the University of Oxford and the nonprofit Global Change Data Lab, uses the case fatality rate to calculate the mortality risk of the disease. Case fatality rate is the ratio of confirmed deaths to confirmed cases. Using that rate, the database shows that the current mortality rate in the U.S. is 5.9%, which puts the survival rate at 94.1%. Johns Hopkins University, which uses the same method, currently lists the U.S. rate at 6%. But even these researchers acknowledge that during a pandemic, the rate of case fatalities is a poor measure of the mortality risk of the disease. Thats partly because the actual number of cases is hard to determine without widespread testing. One, it relies on the number of confirmed cases, and many cases are not confirmed; and two, it relies on the total number of deaths, and with COVID-19, some people who are sick and will die soon have not yet died, Our World in Data researchers wrote in an article. These two facts mean that it is extremely difficult to make accurate estimates of the true risk of death. Dr. Michael Mina, an assistant professor of epidemiology at Harvards T.H. Chan School of Public Health, said that the ability to calculate accurate recovery rates hinges on having access to credible data. The survival rate depends on how well we understand the denominator, Mina wrote in an email. We need to be looking at denominators from good serological surveillance to know the true numbers infected. Additionally, we should consider the infection fatality rate in the context of demographics like age. Infection fatality rate is the number of total deaths from a disease divided by the total number of cases — as opposed to the confirmed deaths and cases. Mina also explained that the data varies sharply when looking at a weighted average of fatality rates for specific age groups: So, a one-number-fits-all value for the infection fatality rate doesnt really make too much sense given the major skew in the data. Even the 94% rate is a flawed statistic amid an ongoing pandemic. Data is incomplete and government agencies and organizations vary in how they collect and report it. Rates that include total cases or confirmed cases should also be considered preliminary, because many outcomes arent known yet: These patients may recover, or they might not. We did find one coronavirus tracking database that singles out the number of deaths among resolved U.S. cases that have had outcomes. Worldometer, a private statistical resource that collects data from official reports, shows that about 289,100 COVID-19 cases in the United States are considered closed as of May 7, 2020. Of those, around 213,500 people have recovered, and about 75,500 have died, according to the database. This represents a 74% survival rate. But this, too, may be off and will continue to fluctuate daily. A Facebook post says the current survival rate for COVID-19 in the US is 98.54%. This is problematic for several reasons. In an ongoing pandemic with incomplete numbers, mortality rates should be viewed with caution. There are a slew of factors to take into account such as variations among demographic groups that skew data, a lack of testing, and the number of active cases. Even discounting these factors, based on current projections, the 98.54% figure is incorrect. If you include all the confirmed cases, the number is about 94%. And while both numbers may sound high, they indicate a fatality rate that is more than 10 times that of the seasonal flu. Ultimately, declaring an accurate U.S. survival rate will be difficult until most cases are resolved and more complete and accurate data is released.",0.2,0.7,0.8,0.5935791489

Bob Barr of Georgia blasted his former party for running up the federal budget deficit during the last eight years. Barr added that he wasn't about to give likely Republican presidential nominee Sen. John McCain any reprieve merely because the Arizona senator is a longtime opponent of so-called pork barrel spending. Opposition to earmarks – line items in the federal budget directed to local and state projects – while a positive, isn't enough, says Barr. Eliminating earmarks would make barely a drop in the bucket with regard to the national debt, the deficit, he said after announcing his candidacy at the National Press Club in Washington. As it turns out, Barr's right on the money about how little earmarks have contributed to expanding the national debt. While earmarking has become an easy focal point for fiscal conservatives concerned about the budget deficit, which is now more than $9-trillion in total, having added another $163-billion plus interest in 2007, it's only a small part of the problem. According to an Office of Management and Budget tally, earmarks totaled $17-billion in fiscal 2007, only about 10 percent of the deficit that year. Admittedly, that's after earmarking dropped considerably following the congressional lobbying scandals of 2005 and 2006. But even at their peak in 2005, when earmarks hit $52-billion, according to the Congressional Research Service and the OMB, that was only 16 percent of that year's deficit of $318-billion.

One sits at the intersection of Ga. 9 and Ga. 92/Holcomb Bridge Road. The other camera is located at Ga. 9 and Ga. 140/Mansell Road. The cameras were installed in February 2007.Red-light cameras became popular in many cities and counties as a way to reduce the number of motorists who run red lights and hit other vehicles or pedestrians who assumed they had the right of way. There is an ongoing argument about whether the cameras are effective when it comes to reducing accidents. The National Motorists Association, a group advocating motorists rights, has led the fight against the cameras.There is no evidence that these ticket camera systems make drivers more safe, the association states on its website. In fact, the opposite has proven true. Ticket cameras increase accidents!A study by the Federal Highway Administration found that red-light cameras provide a modest aggregate crash-cost benefit. The study found the cameras tend to reduce severe side-impact crashes, but increase less-severe rear-end collisions. The city of Alpharetta has red-light cameras at more intersections (seven) than any community in Georgia, according to state records. Atlanta has working cameras at six intersections, the records show.The city of Snellville, though, removed its cameras a few years ago. City officials said the number of violators was so small that it wasnt cost-effective to keep them.Roswell officials have made a similar case to scrap its cameras, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported.Acenbrak said the city researched the number of wrecks at those intersections three years before the cameras were installed and three years afterward. The state Department of Transportation does not do its own research of wrecks at intersections with red-light cameras. It collects the data from the cities and counties with cameras, a spokeswoman said.Heres what Acenbrak shared with PolitiFact Georgia at both intersections.At the Ga. 9 and Holcomb Bridge Road intersection, there was a slightly higher ratio of collisions there after the camera was installed. Acenbrak said there were three wrecks in the 25 months prior to the cameras. There were three wrecks in the 22 months after the cameras were installed, he said.At Ga. 9 and Mansell Road, there was a higher percentage of wrecks before the cameras were installed as opposed to the total afterward. Acenbraks numbers show there were three wrecks in the 13 months before the cameras were installed, a ratio of one collision about every four months. The director said there were two crashes in the 22 months afterward, a ratio of one wreck every 11 months.Acenbrak said those numbers prove his point, along with other data he presented to us, such as less than 3 percent of wrecks throughout the city each year can be attributed to motorists running red lights.We still have red-light runners, but theyre not causing crashes, he said.To summarize, Acenbrak said the number of wrecks at Roswells red-light camera intersections was virtually the same before and after the cameras were installed. At Ga. 9 and Holcomb Bridge Road, it was almost identical. At Ga. 9 and Mansell Road, the ratio of wrecks after the cameras were installed was smaller. ",0.7,0.3,1,0.04086082702

Joe Kyrillos has tied U.S. Sen. Robert Menendez to growth in the national debt and deficits. In an interview on NJTVs On the Record that aired June 8, Menendez, a Democrat, responded to those charges.Well first of all, evidently my Republican opponent has selective memory, Menendez said, first citing growth in state debt under Kyrillos watch.Then, Menendez said: Here's someone who raided the state's -- voted to raid the state's pension funds by $2.8 billion that is costing New Jersey taxpayers still today to the tune of nearly $15 billion dollars to repay that money.Kyrillos helped pushed through a controversial plan in 1997 from then-Gov. Christie Whitman to sell nearly $2.8 billion in bonds in a bid to cover unfunded liabilities in the states pension system.To be clear, we are not ruling on whether the pension bonds were sound fiscal policy. We are also not ruling on Whitmans overall impact on the pension system. Were looking at two, specific claims: whether voting for the bonds constituted a $2.8 billion raid on the pension system and whether they are costing taxpayers $15 billion to pay off.Both statements veer from the truth, PolitiFact New Jersey found.The bond legislation -- approved on June 5, 1997, with Kyrillos voting in favor of it -- authorized the states Economic Development Authority to sell $2.75 billion in bonds, the proceeds of which were deposited in state retirement funds for public workers.A separate, companion bill changed accounting rules for the pension system and allowed the state and local employers to reduce their normal contributions by the amount of surplus in the funds.The move allowed Whitman to avoid making nearly $600 million in payments into the pension system that year, which helped balance her budget.Melissa Castro, a spokeswoman for the Menendez campaign, said skipping scheduled payments into the pension system is a raid of pension funds, because by definition, it is reducing the total funds available to pay the funds' obligations.Whitman skipped payments that year -- as she did in others -- but she put nearly $2.8 billion of borrowed money in the funds. That does not fit the definition of a raid.Now, whats the final price tag for those pension bonds, which mature in 2029?Menendez put the tab at nearly $15 billion. According to the state Treasury Department, the bonds -- which the state is paying more than 7 percent interest on -- will cost $10.1 billion to pay off. The general fund shoulders the burden of the bond payments, not the pension system.Treasury Department spokesman Andy Pratt said its unfair to look at the expense of the bonds without also considering the investment interest the money is earning. The average rate of return has been 6.36 percent a year, Pratt said.Ultimately, the states general fund is still on the hook for $10.1 billion. In the upcoming budget, debt service on the bonds will cost nearly $300 million.Castro said whether it was $15 billion or $10 billion, Menendez is still correct on his fundamental point. Nevertheless this is still bad fiscal policy, she said.Our rulingMenendez said Kyrillos voted to raid the state's pension funds by $2.8 billion that is costing New Jersey taxpayers still today to the tune of nearly $15 billion dollars to repay that money.Kyrillos voted in favor of borrowing $2.75 billion to put into the states pension funds. The move allowed Whitman to avoid nearly $600 million in pension payments that year, but overall, money went into the system, not out of it. To call it a vote to raid pension funds by $2.8 billion is inaccurate.Also, the bonds will cost taxpayers, in total, about $10.1 billion, not $15 billion.To comment on this ruling, go to NJ.com.",0.5,0.6,0.8,0.07259635248

After Rocks joke, actor Will Smith, Pinkett Smiths husband, walked onstage and slapped him. Soon after, some social media users expressed skepticism that the hair loss is due to an illness. Alopecia isn't a medical disease; it's an aesthetic one, read a March 28 post on Facebook. The post was flagged as part of Facebooks efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The term alopecia broadly refers to hair loss from any cause, including normal aging, according to the Mayo Clinic. Some types of alopecia, such as alopecia areata, are an autoimmune disease, a type of illness that occurs when the immune system mistakenly attacks part of the body, according to the American Academy of Dermatology Association. Pinkett Smith has alopecia areata. Its unclear whether Rock knew about Pinkett Smiths condition, the Associated Press reported. Alopecia areata is a disease that occurs when the bodys immune system attacks hair follicles, often on the scalp or face, but sometimes on other parts of the body, the AP reported. Sometimes hair falls out in chunks and only partial baldness results. Sometimes hair grows back but repeated bouts of baldness can also occur. It is not life-threatening, but there is no cure. The statement that alopecia isn't a medical disease contains an element of truth — the term alopecia broadly refers to hair loss from any cause, including normal aging. But the claim ignores critical facts: Some types of alopecia are an autoimmune disease. ",0.3,0.7,0.9,0.4282449893

False Confidence (between 0 and 1): 0.3",I argued for years that we need to move from a 'Musharraf policy' to a 'Pakistan policy.' ,"For years, the U.S. government has had an uneasy relationship with Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf. While there was discomfort with Musharraf's dictatorial ways, he was also seen as a key ally in fighting al-Qaida, a moving target between Afghanistan and parts of Pakistan. Musharraf resigned on Aug. 18, 2008, rather than face imminent impeachment proceedings, and two days later Sen. Barack Obama issued a bit of an I-told-you-so. I argued for years that we need to move from a 'Musharraf policy' to a 'Pakistan policy,' Obama said in a speech before the Veterans of Foreign Wars National Convention on Aug. 19. We must move beyond an alliance built on mere convenience or a relationship with one man. Now, with President Musharraf's resignation, we have the opportunity to do just that. That's why I've co-sponsored a bill to triple nonmilitary aid to the Pakistani people, while ensuring that the military assistance we do provide is used to take the fight to the Taliban and al-Qaida in the tribal regions of Pakistan. The question here is whether Obama inflated his foresight on Musharraf in an effort to bolster his credibility on foreign policy. What did he say and when did he say it? The Obama campaign provided a handful of citations. In July, Obama said on CNN'sLarry King Live:In order for us to be effective in dealing with the resurgence of al-Qaida and the Taliban as they use Pakistan — the northwest provinces — as a sanctuary, we've got to have a stronger relationship with the Pakistani government — the new Pakistani government. We had put all our eggs in the Musharraf basket. And then there's this from Obama, inNewsweek,in April: There is a sizable middle class in Pakistan that believes in rule of law and believes in a government that is accountable to the people. So our willingness to put all our eggs in the Musharraf basket without understanding this other tradition, and without understanding that our choice in a place like Pakistan is not simply between military dictatorship or Islamic rule, led us to make a series of miscalculations that has weakened our fight against terrorism in the region. And in March, Obama in theWashinton Post:In Pakistan, I will reject the false choice between stability and democracy. In our unconditional support for Musharraf, we have gotten neither. And in February, at a Democratic debate: I've said very clearly that we have put all our eggs in the Musharraf basket. That was a mistake. We should be going after al-Qaida and making sure that Pakistan is serious about hunting down terrorists, as well as expanding democracy. Last November, Obama helped lead a Senate resolution that condemned Musharraf for invoking a state of emergency; and called on Musharraf to relinquish his position as chief of army staff of Pakistan and to allow for free and fair elections. That clearly puts Obama on record in the past year. I believe Obama is correct in stating that he has wanted to move past a Musharraf-centric strategy in Pakistan for some time now, said Daniel Markey, a senior fellow for India, Pakistan and South Asia at the nonpartisan Council on Foreign Relations. To some extent, this shows genuine foresight, but it is important to note that Obama was not alone in this view, Markey told PolitiFact. In fact, many people outside the Bush administration have been saying this — or something similar — since shortly after 9/11. It has been the common refrain of many think tankers, and of course it has been reiterated by Pakistani opposition leaders (from Benazir Bhutto down) who were excluded from power by Musharraf. The question here is whether Obama's position is one he has advocated for years. Last August, Obama made headlines when he said during a speech in Washington, If we have actionable intelligence about high-value terrorist targets (in Pakistan) and President Musharraf won't act, we will. Sen. John McCain later called that statement naive and said, You don't broadcast that you are going to bomb a country that is a sovereign nation and that you are dependent on the good will of the people of that country to help you in the war — in the struggle against Taliban and the sanctuaries which they hold. One could argue that Obama's vow to act independently against terrorist cells in Pakistan, if Musharraf wouldn't, amounted to advocacy for moving from a Musharraf policy to a Pakistan policy. And that would put him on record a year ago. But by way of rebuttal, the McCain campaign provided this Obama nugget from an MSNBC Democratic presidential debate on Aug. 7, 2007 (just days after Obama's if-Musharraf-won't-we-will line): I did not say that we would immediately go in (to Pakistan) unilaterally. What I said was that we have to work with Musharraf, because the biggest threat to American security right now are in the northwest provinces of Pakistan and that we should continue to give him military aid contingent on him doing something about that. So even Obama, at this point, was talking about still trying to work with Musharraf. Part of our conundrum here is that in the course of 24 hours, Obama changed the timeline on his claim of advocating the United States move from a 'Musharraf policy' to a 'Pakistan policy' — first stating that he advocated it a year ago and then ratcheting it up a day later, saying he had argued it for years. We checked the congressional record and couldn't find any statements from the floor or in the text of any legislation that Obama co-sponsored that suggests this was a years-old position. If Obama had said he has been advocating this position for months, he'd be on solid footing. And he rightly gets credit for some foresight on the issue. But when he says it's a position he has argued for years he is giving himself more credit than even his campaign can confirm. ",0.6,0.4,1,0.8139688423

Ever? Considering the magnitude of some other hurricanes in history, PolitiFact New Jersey decided to investigate. Doug OMalley, interim director for Environment New Jersey, said 'destructive' refers to the storm's financial damages. Data shows that while Sandy may be the worst storm to ever batter New Jersey and the tristate region, its not the most destructive Atlantic storm in history.Lets start with some background.Sandy slammed New Jersey on Oct. 29, leveling houses along the Shore and inland, and leaving millions without power for extended periods. The storm also unleashed a similar fury on New York and Connecticut.We checked Atlantic storms in the National Hurricane Centers data archives, which tracks storm costs through 2010. Hurricane Irene, which hit New Jersey in 2011, is not included.Leading the list is 2005s Hurricane Katrina, at $108 billion. Even though Katrina was largely a Gulf Coast storm, doing the most damage in Louisiana and Mississippi, it formed in the Atlantic and made landfall near Floridas Miami-Dade/Broward county line. It then moved across south Florida into the eastern Gulf of Mexico, according to Hurricane Center data.Katrina is still a clear runaway number one in terms of damages, said Dennis Eltgen, a spokesman at the Miami-based Hurricane Center.Second on the list is 1992s Hurricane Andrew, at $26.5 billion in damages. Andrew devastated parts of south Florida, continued into the Gulf of Mexico and turned north, hitting Louisiana.Those rankings change when damages are adjusted for 2010 dollars.In that case, the Great Miami Hurricane of 1926 that hit southeast Florida and Alabama ranks first, at $164.8 billion; Katrina second, at $113 billion; and Andrew fifth, at $58.5 billion.Sandy, however, is different than many hurricanes that often swing through the Gulf of Mexico.I dont think we were trying to claim that Sandy was more destructive than Katrina, OMalley said. We were trying to say Sandy was the worst hurricane to fully hit the Eastern Seaboard. That being said, Katrina did obviously really hit New Orleans but clearly, it tailed over Florida. We were counting Katrina as only hitting the Gulf Coast. We trust the National Hurricane Center. If they say its both, we agree with that.The governors of New Jersey, New York and Connecticut have estimated Sandys damages at $82 billion. President Obama has requested $60 billion in federal aid for the three states. The Senate approved the request and the House passed a $9 billion aid package Friday, and additional aid is expected to pass on Jan. 15.In making the aid request for the White House, Jeffrey D. Zients, deputy director for Management for the Office of Management and Budget, described Sandys place in hurricane history in a letter to House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio).All told, although estimates of the total damage of Hurricane Sandy remain in flux, current projections are that Sandy is on track to be the second or third most costly natural disaster in U.S, history, behind Hurricane Katrina (2005) and close to Hurricane Andrew (1992), Zients wrote.Our rulingEnvironment New Jersey claimed that Octobers Hurricane Sandy is the most destructive Atlantic storm, ever.Sandy may be the most destructive storm to hit a part of the Eastern Seaboard but in terms of most destructive Atlantic storms, that title goes to Katrina, which formed in the Atlantic and whose damages topped $100 billion, according to Hurricane Center data. Sandy, however, is very high on the list, with damages totaling at least $82 billion. Still, thats not number one in todays dollars or compared with storms adjusted for inflation in 2010.

Obama was referring to whether an employer should dictate whether employees insurance covers contraceptives. Romney sidestepped the issue about insurance coverage and said he opposes a different concept — whether employers can tell someone whether they can have contraceptive care.For this fact-check, were asking whether Romney has suggested that employers should be able to make the decision as to whether or not a woman gets contraception through her insurance coverage.The Blunt amendmentObamas support for his claim centers on something called the Blunt amendment.Early this year, congressional Republicans made a big push to roll back a provision by Health and Human Services under Obamas health care law that requires most employers to provide birth control coverage without any out-of-pocket costs, with a limited exception for certain religious institutions.In the Senate, Sen. Roy Blunt, R-Mo., sponsored an amendment that would exempt employers from providing any service that went against their beliefs or moral convictions. At the time, the issue put the Obama administration on the defensive and the president himself appeared at the White House briefing room to explain a work-around for religious affiliated hospitals, universities and the like.A few weeks later, with a vote on the Blunt amendment pending, Romney was asked where he stood. He told a Boston radio interviewer Of course I support the Blunt amendment.CNSnews.com, a conservative news service, put the question directly to the Romney campaign.Will Mitt Romney, on day one, rescind this mandate in its entirety — as the Catholic Church has urged the current administration to do — so that individuals, employers and insurers who have a moral or religious objection to contraception or sterilization will not be forced to violate the tenets of their own faith or act against their consciences?Romney campaign spokesman Ryan Williams responded: Yes. Gov. Romney would rescind the mandate in its entirety.In April, Romney reiterated his opposition to the rule at a meeting of the National Rifle Association. He said, As president, I will abolish it.So the Obama campaign argues if Romney supports an employers ability to decline to provide a service that goes against beliefs or moral convictions, that means he supports employers making the decision as to whether or not a woman gets contraception through her insurance coverage.Romneys responseWe asked the Romney campaign to explain his objection to Obamas claim. Here's a statement from spokeswoman Andrea Saul: The statement acknowledges that Romney opposes a nationwide mandate for contraception coverage. In the absence of a federal mandate, that would sometimes leave the decision to employers whether to offer coverage for birth control.(Before Obamacare, some 27 states already required such coverage, though were not sure how many had religious exceptions.)Our rulingObama said Romney suggested that employers should be able to make the decision as to whether or not a woman gets contraception through her insurance coverage.Romney says he doesnt believe bureaucrats or employers should make the call whether a woman can use contraceptives. But his support for the Blunt amendment endorses the approach that employers should be able to make the decision about whether contraception is covered by employees insurance.",0.7,0.4,0.9,0.03852013141

False Confidence (between 0 and 1): 0.1","The Seminole gambling compact offers $3 billion in guaranteed revenue, the largest share for any state in history.","The Seminole Tribe of Florida is trying to convince the Legislature that approving a new gaming compact is a safe bet. As lawmakers consider a plan negotiated between the Seminoles and Gov. Rick Scott, the tribe has started running commercials with the message that the agreement helps the state. One of the ads ticks off several benefits of the deal Scott has touted to the Legislature, which has been reluctant to agree to the compact. The governor authorized a new and unprecedented Seminole compact: Nearly 20,000 new Florida jobs; $3 billion in guaranteed revenue, the largest share for any state in history; and for the first time, empowering the Legislature to limit expansion to keep Florida's entertainment options family friendly, the commercial said. Thats a lot to pack into one 30-second spot. PolitiFact Florida was especially curious about the $3 billion in payments the tribe promised the state. Is it really the most any state has received from Indian gaming in history? It looks like the odds are in the tribes favor. Reaching an agreement This is a very convoluted subject, but heres a quick-start look at the issue: Since 1988, the U.S. government has allowed federally recognized Indian tribes to run gambling establishments on tribal land. But if a tribe wants to have certain Las Vegas-style games at its casino known as Class III games (blackjack, roulette, slot machines and so forth), it must reach a legal agreement with its state, called a compact. The Seminole tribe reached a deal with then-Gov. Charlie Crist in 2010 that allowed them to operate banked card games — games in which players bet against the house instead of each other — at five of its seven casinos across the state. The Seminoles agreed to pay Florida for exclusive rights to operate these games, plus slot machines at four casinos outside Miami-Dade and Broward counties. These revenues usually amounted to well over $200 million per year for the state. The compact expired in July 2015, with a renewal deadline of Oct. 31, 2015. There hasnt been a new agreement, leading to lawsuits between Florida and the Seminoles over who can operate these games. The tribe continues to operate the Class III games of blackjack, chemin de fer and baccarat at those five casinos without a compact. In December 2015, Scott announced he had formed a new compact with the Seminoles. Among the details in the 20-year deal is a promise that the tribe could expand craps and roulette at their casinos and offer blackjack exclusively for seven years. The tribe would guarantee a minimum of $3 billion in payments to the state over those seven years. The Legislature is considering approving the compact during the 2016 session. On Feb. 9, the House Regulatory Affairs Committee okayed a bill to ratify the compact, but the Senate delayed its vote. Is that $3 billion in guaranteed revenue to Florida the most any state has ever gotten, as the Seminoles commercial says? Its the guaranteed part that tips the tribes hand. Comparing compacts Dozens of Indian tribes have gaming compacts in 26 states, and the details differ not only among states, but among tribes in a given state. While tribes can reach agreements to share revenue with local governments and pay regulatory costs, were just looking at how much states get. Comparing these compacts is a tall order. Given the nature of the industry, casinos are always opening and closing, contract terms are being updated or changed, and the terms of the payments tribes give differ depending on the compact. Thats especially true when considering states like Connecticut, whichreceives a lot of money but bases compact payments on a percentage of casino earnings, or Washington, which negotiated compacts so money goes to local governments instead of the state. The Seminoles currently pay the state quite a bit for a single tribe, which we can illustrate with overall earnings and revenue-sharing figures. In California, for example, tribal casinos make about $7 billion per year, highest in the nation. Of that, they give about $241 million to the state in 2014. (The state had compacts with 73 tribes in 2014, but only 11 of those tribes paid into the general revenue fund.) Tribes in Oklahoma, which generated $3.8 billion in gaming revenues from 124 casinos, paid the state about $125 million in 2013. Florida is in third place for total gaming revenues, with more than $2.3 billion from eight casinos. The Seminoles operate seven of those to make the lions share of the revenue, and as we mentioned, more than $200 million of those revenues go to the state annually. (The Miccosukee tribe, which operates an eighth casino in the Miami area, does not need a compact based on the games it offers.) Robert Jarvis, a law professor at Nova Southeastern University in Fort Lauderdale, said the Seminoles can afford to give the state so much because they enjoy several distinct advantages tribes in other states do not. The Seminoles live on land close to population centers, like the Hard Rock casinos in Tampa and Hollywood. They also dont have to fight with other tribes for customers. It doesnt hurt that this is Florida, where tourists flock and bring gambling money with them. These factors affect how the Seminoles have negotiated with the state. The new Seminole compact offers the guaranteed $3 billion in rising increments, from $325 million the first year up to $550 million in the seventh year. There are other provisions and potential payments in the compact, but that $3 billion is money the tribe has promised to pay no matter what. Even though apples-to-apples comparisons are difficult, by that final year the Seminoles would be paying more than the total any other single state gets from all its tribes. The Seminoles are willing to pay out a lot more than other tribes, Jarvis said, because they want exclusivity in a market that the Legislature could open up to other casino developers. The real question here is not the money, which in a budget as big as Floridas really amounts to a rounding error, he said. Its about expanding gambling in Florida. And if youre for that, the question becomes, who do you want to run the casinos, the Seminoles or someone else? Our ruling The Seminole Tribe of Florida said their new gambling compact offers $3 billion in guaranteed revenue, the largest share for any state in history. The tribe's point about guaranteed compensation over seven years holds up when focused on total dollars. But there's no easy way to make apples-to-apples comparisons of the details between various states and their gaming compacts. Some states have compacts with many other tribes.Some deals call for tribes to split a portion of revenues only with local governments. The takeaway from the ad is Florida is getting the best financial deal of any state in the country, but the finer points aren't clear.

So, in 2011, he's talking about comprehensive court reform.Addressing a group of nearly 50 reporters and editors at the annual pre-session meeting organized by the Associated Press, Cannon again made his case that the court system should not have removed constitutional amendments that, if approved by voters, would have granted tax breaks for first-time home buyers and affected state redistricting. A third amendment was drafted in response to the new federal health care law to prohibit Florida from participating in any health insurance exchange that compels people to buy insurance.All three amendments were stripped from the ballot after judges ruled that the attached ballot language was either flawed or misleading.Cannon said he will propose legislative changes to effectively remove or diminish judicial review of ballot questions.But that's not all.Florida's judicial system has the authority to take away not only a person's liberty, but also a person's life. Understanding the severity and irreversible nature of that penalty, we have a responsibility to ensure that justice is administered not only fairly, but also efficiently, Cannon said. Criminal cases are complex in nature and in recent years we've seen cases overturned, and there have been errors. The number of inmates since 2000 on death row dying of natural causes has now surpassed the number of inmates executed. Significant and unreasonable delays plague the current process of conducting state post-conviction review in these cases and it appears that there is little the Supreme Court can do to improve or streamline the process.Cannon said that is where the Legislature can step in.I believe the Legislature can and should work with the judicial branch to significantly improve the administration of justice in death penalty cases, he said. I am hopeful that reform could lead to a more equitable judicial system for all Floridians, and as we move forward toward the 2011 legislative session, we will continue to explore this issue to determine when and what the right course of action for Florida may be.Cannon hasn't specified what court reform legislation might look like, though by his comments it sure sounds like he wants the appeals process in death row cases hastened. In that vein, we decided to check his facts about Florida's death row, focusing on this claim: The number of inmates since 2000 on death row dying of natural causes has now surpassed the number of inmates executed.Of the 392 people now on Florida's death row,House records indicate that145 inmateshave been there for 20 years or longer and 34have been there for 30 years or more, according to Cannon spokeswoman Katie Betta.Gary Alvord has been on Florida's death row since April 1974, according to the Florida Department of Corrections. Alvord escaped a Michigan mental hospital and wound up in Tampa, where he killed three women. Alvord, who turned 64 on Jan. 10, 2011, has been on death row for more than 13,400 days. This April, he will have been awaiting execution for37 years.John Vining, who was sentenced to death in 1990, is the oldest person on death row. On March 13, 2011, he will turn 80.Vining wasconvicted of shooting and killing a woman who was trying to sell him a $60,000 diamond.Since Florida reinstated the death penalty in 1976 (and began carrying out sentences in 1979), 69 people have been executed -- a rate of a little over two per year. One reason, for starters,is a lengthy and costly appeals process. But politics plays a role as well. The governor must sign a death warrant for an execution to proceed.And sometimesother complicating factors are cited.Alvord, for instance, has a long history of mental illness and has been declared mentally incompetent by several courts.The last person to be executed in Florida was Martin Grossman in February 2010. Grossman was convicted of shooting a Pinellas County wildlife officer who happened upon Grossman shooting a stolen handgun in a wooded area.Gov. Charlie Crist signed the death warrant of David Eugene Johnston in 2010 as well, but Johnston died while awaiting his sentence. He was convicted of stabbing an 84-year-old Orlando woman to death in 1983.That transitions naturally to Cannon's claim.The Florida Department of Corrections provided PolitiFact Florida with a list of 55 inmates who died on death row starting Jan. 1, 2000. Thirty of the 55 somehow died while awaiting their sentence (the state does not describe the nature of a person's death), and 25 were executed.For example, Eddie Lee Sexton Sr. died on Dec. 29, 2010, while living on death row. Sexton was convicted of murder after a jury found that he ordered his mentally impaired son to strangle Sexton's son-in-law at a Florida park. Sexton feared that the son-in-law was going to report family abuses to local authorities, prosecutors said. Sexton was sentenced to death in 1998.Robert Power died on Dec. 3, 2010, while awaiting sentence for the rape and murder of a 12-year-old Orange County girl. Power had been on death row for 20 years. The waiting and appeals process certainly comes with additional cost. The Death Penalty Information Center, a Washington policy group that does not advocate for or against the death penalty, published a 2009 report discussing the cost of enforcing the death penalty. The group cited a 2000 Palm Beach Post analysis, which said that the state spends $51 million a year enforcing the death penalty. That's $51 million a year more than it would cost to punish all first-degree murderers with life in prison instead. The figure has been repeated by several other news publications as well as Rex Dimmig, chief assistant public defender of the 10th Judicial Circuit, in testimony before a state Senate committee discussing the death penalty.Make no mistake, the death penalty is a controversial and complex policy issue. But here, we're focusing on Cannon's call for reforms based on death row inmate data. He said: The number of inmates since 2000 on death row dying of natural causes has now surpassed the number of inmates executed. He's right. Of the 55 death row inmates to die since Jan. 1, 2000, only 25 actually were executed.",1,0,1,0.04865948357

Put pressure on the Democrats to end the horrible law that separates children from there (sic) parents once they cross the Border into the U.S., Trump tweeted. Trump recently told Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen, I know what you're going through right now with families is very tough, but those are the bad laws that the Democrats gave us. We have to break up families. But there is no law that mandates separating children from their parents. Trumps own administration devised a policy to that effect. So what is Trump talking about? Whenever parents are charged with a federal misdemeanor (entry without inspection in this case), or awaiting trial, they are placed in the custody of the U.S. Marshals Service. Children cannot go to jail, so they are transferred to the custody of Health and Human Services Office of Refugee Resettlement. They are then placed with relatives, juvenile detention centers or foster care. Thats a longstanding Homeland Security policy, DHS told us. Before the Trump administration, immigrants entering illegally as families were rarely prosecuted, said Sarah Pierce, an associate policy analyst of the U.S. Immigration Program at the Migration Policy Institute. Instead, immigrants were held in family detention centers until they were sent to appear before an immigration court or deported. Attorney General Jeff Sessionsannounced on April 6 the Homeland Security Department would now be referring all illegal border crossings to the Justice Department for prosecution. Facing criminal charges, parents would go to detention centers, leaving their children unaccompanied. Its the decision to prosecute parents that is causing the separations. Thats a choice they have made thats largely different from what other administrations have done, said Peter Margulies, an immigration law and national security law professor at Roger Williams University School of Law. When we asked for evidence of policies separating families, the White House referred us to items determining what happens to unaccompanied immigrant minors. But none of the children in question would be deemed unaccompanied if the Trump administration did not decide to prosecute their parents. The 1997 Flores Settlement Agreement, for example, calls for the release of unaccompanied minors to family members or sponsors who can care for them as their immigration case is resolved. The Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of 2008, which Trump has wrongly called a Democrat rule, determines that unaccompanied minors be transferred to Health and Human Servicescustody. The White House argued such policies encourage parents to send their children into the United States, knowing they will be promptly released. The cruel and inhumane open borders policies of the Democratic Party are responsible for encouraging mass illegal migration, enabling horrendous child smuggling, and releasing violent MS-13 gang members into American communities, White House deputy press secretary Hogan Gidley said in an emailed statement. The Trump administration may believe that Democrats are responsible for policies that encourage illegal border crossing, but we found no law mandating that children be separated from their parents. Trump said a horrible law requires that children be separated from their parents once they cross the Border into the U.S. There is no such law. The Homeland Security Departments longstanding policy is to separate children from their custodians when they are referred for criminal prosecution. Trumps administration has decided to prosecute all illegal crossings. Families were rarely prosecuted under previous administrations.",0.1,0.9,0.7,0.4954488547

John Kitzhabers claim that half of the $1,000 per student increase in spending in primary and secondary education in the next biennium was due to the retirement costs. (The statement was true.) So when fiscal conservative Rep. Dennis Richardson, R-Central Point, made his own retirement system claim, our ears perked right up.In a newsletter to constituents, Richardson noted that $1,100 of the tuition paid by every Oregon university student annually goes just to pay the costs of PERS.The representative's source was a presentation by Jay Kenton, the Oregon University Systems vice chancellor for finance and administration.Kenton had given a presentation on what drives the cost of higher education. Naturally, retirement and health care costs are a big piece of the equation.Essentially what Kenton had done was to take the total retirement costs of employees -- both faculty and staff -- paid in part from tuition. He then prorated the total by actual percentage of it paid with tuition dollars.After all that math, he found that the projected share of an individual students annual tuition going toward university staff retirement benefits for the 2012-13 year was $849. Thats actually about on par for what it was the previous year, too.So how did Richardson get the $1,100 figure? Well, thats where Kentons projections put the figure for the 2013-14 school year, should Kitzhabers proposed reforms not be enacted.With the technical bits out of the way, we went back to Richardsons statement. He said that $1,100 of the tuition paid by every Oregon university student annually goes just to pay the costs of PERS.Hes right, but only if the projections come to pass. In other words, we may get there, but we havent yet. As it is now, that figure is closer to $850. Its still high, to be sure, but its about $250 less than the figure Richardson is using.The ruling: Richardsons statement reads as if weve been at the $1,100 mark for a while, when in truth we havent actually gotten there. If the Legislature passes significant reforms this year -- a big if -- we may never get there.If we were writing a newsletter, wed have gone with the most recent solid figure from the 2011-12 school year, which is about $850. Or, we would have made it clearer that the $1,100 was an extrapolation, a prediction. Richardson did neither.Though his claim is accurate, it requires additional information.",0.8,0.3,0.9,0.682504237

In a recent video for the conservative group Prager U, Koonin noted several trends that ought to reassure people. Among them, the ice in Greenland. Greenland's ice sheet isn't shrinking any more rapidly today than it was 80 years ago, said Koonin, now a New York University professor of physics. Koonin told us he based this on a widely accepted study of the Greenland ice sheet and rising sea levels. The main problem is that study only went through 2010, and ice losses have accelerated since then. Theres been a steeper and longer lasting decline in recent decades compared with the pre-World War II period Koonin mentioned. Greenland lost ice faster this decade than 80 years ago. Read the full fact-check in our bio. ##ClimateChange ##LearnOnTikTok The Greenland ice sheet is second only to the Antarctic in size, covering about 660,000 square miles. It is a key barometer of climate change, and its fate has great importance for overall sea level changes and impacts on ocean currents. Measuring Greenlands ice involves much more than just tracking the area it covers. Researchers need to factor in the amount of snowfall that adds to its mass, and weigh that against the millions of gallons of water that evaporate into the atmosphere or melt into the water. Plus, in a process called calving, large chunks break off and drift away as icebergs. Satellites provide some of the best information to track trends in the ice, but they date back only to the early 1990s. Before then, the best data came from aerial photographs in the 1930s and 1940s. When the underlying terrain is known, scientists compare pictures over the years to tell what happened with the ice. Using historic air and sea measurements and computer models, researchers can push the estimates of the mass of the ice as far back as the mid-1800s. Koonin told us that he relied on an article about the role of melting ice on rising sea levels. The August 2020 paper noted two periods when Greenland ice added the most to the oceans — around 1940 and after about 1990. The highest amount came in 1937 when Greenlands ice sheet caused the sea level to rise by .76 millimeters. In 2010, the ice sheet added .7 millimeters to the oceans. (Measuring rising sea levels due to the Greenland ice sheet and measuring ice loss from the sheet are two sides of the same coin.) The main issue with this data is that it stops at 2010. The latest report card for the Greenland ice sheet from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said that in 2012 and 2019, the ice sheet saw its greatest losses since regular monitoring began in the 1950s. In 2012, it shed about 464 gigatons, and in 2019, it lost about 532 gigatons. According to NASA, 1 gigaton of ice would cover Central Park in New York and reach 1,119 feet high. Following a period of relative stability from the 1970s to early 1990s, the ice sheet began losing ice at an accelerating rate and has now experienced annual net ice loss every year since 1998, the report said. Many of the researchers who worked on that analysis were part of a project that pulled together multiple ways of measuring the mass of Greenlands ice and built a tool that tracks the ice nearly in real time. They made the full data tables available and, with the help of one of those collaborators, Kristian Kjeldsen at the Geological Survey of Denmark and Greenland in Denmark, we summarized the ice loss trends decade by decade. The overall trend is that losses have been more sustained and deeper than during the pre-WWII period that Koonin referred to in his video. All studies of the Greenland ice sheet find that the numbers bounce around a lot from year to year. Averages for each decade help smooth out the trends. Even with the best methods, pinpoint accuracy is out of reach, and the shaded areas show the high and low estimates, with the solid line showing the mid-points. The further back in time, the bigger the uncertainty. Some observations point to a warm period in the late 1920s and early 1930s, which coincides with glacier retreat in the southeast, Kjeldsen said. But he noted, after 2000, negative numbers are more persistent. The 1930s low point of 206 gigatons of ice sheet loss is not as large as the 247 gigatons average yearly loss between 2010 and 2020. We counted the years of continuous decline. The current stretch of year-on-year losses since 1998 is the longest this century. (We reworked the yearly numbers several ways, looking at five-year periods and average changes during periods of ice loss. The overall trends remained the same.) Researcher Twila Moon, deputy lead scientist with the National Snow and Ice Data Center at the University of Colorado, said the tons of ice lost today actually are more significant than losses in the 1930s. Back then, the ice sheet was bigger. After losing ice in the earlier part of the 20th century, the ice sheet did not expand back to its previous mass and shape, Moon said. So as warming air and ocean temperatures arrived in the later part of the 20th century, the ice loss was picking up from a different starting point. We shared the latest numbers with Koonin, and he highlighted the uncertainties in the estimates. By his calculations, theres about a 40% chance that the losses were greater in the 1930s than in the 2010s. There are different ways to calculate the odds. Andrew Dessler, professor of atmospheric sciences at Texas A&M University, estimated that theres about a 25% chance that the losses were greater in the 1930s than in the 2010s. In either scenario, using either estimate, that would mean theres a greater chance the ice losses were greater in the 2010s than the 1930s. Koonin said that Greenland's ice sheet isn't shrinking any more rapidly today than it was 80 years ago. Koonin relied on a study that had data through 2010. Experts agree that a period of warmer temperatures caused a large loss of ice in the 1930s. But the most recent data shows a period of steeper and longer lasting declines in the Greenland ice sheet between 2010 and 2020 than in the period 80 years ago. There is uncertainty in the data, but Koonins numbers are incomplete and obscure the scale of recent ice losses.",0.2,0.8,1,0.6995444851

Kasichs allies have been preparing for FitzGerald nearly as long. There is little doubt FitzGerald will trade heavily on his experience as an FBI agent and his reputation for turning the page on a corrupt chapter of county government. But the GOP prefers to focus on FitzGeralds largely inconsequential mention as Public Official 14 in the indictment of Jimmy Dimora, the county commissioner later convicted on racketeering and other charges. Consider how the Republican Governors Association (RGA) welcomed FitzGerald to the race. After failing to recruit a more experienced candidate, Democrats are now stuck with Ed FitzGeralds brand of pay-to-play and corruption politics, said Executive Director Phil Cox. PolitiFact Ohio decided this was a good time to reexamine FitzGeralds tangential connections to the widespread federal investigation of county corruption. The RGA statement was not the first -- nor will it be the last -- reference to the case. The Ohio Republican Party has launched a web site -- www.publicofficial14.com-- to blast FitzGerald, known in GOP shorthand as P.O. 14. But how fair and truthful are these tactics? The Plain Dealer wrote extensively in 2010 about FitzGeralds bit role in the Dimora investigation. FitzGerald at the time was the mayor of Lakewood and the Democratic nominee for the powerful new position of county executive. Federal prosecutors charged Dimora a week after FitzGerald won the primary. They described a Lakewood deal for which Dimora had been bribed. On March 6, 2008, Dimora called FitzGerald on behalf of developer William Neiheiser, who was interested in leasing Lakewoods ice rink. Neiheiser had been having trouble reaching the mayor. Neiheiser wants to make a proposal to you ... that he thinks will be advantageous to the city and to you if you wanted to talk to him, Dimora told FitzGerald, according to a wiretap transcript. FitzGerald replied: Ill make the time  Ill make time to talk to him. Dimora added: If theres anything we can do, uh, let us know . any help we can provide. Neiheiser pleaded guilty to charges that he bribed Dimora with free home improvements and other gifts in exchange for favors involving the ice rink and other public contracts. Essentially Dimora, then the chairman of the Cuyahoga County Democratic Party, flaunted his ability to get lower-level party leaders on the telephone when a patron such as Neiheiser was in need. Prosecutors did not accuse FitzGerald of wrongdoing in the Dimora indictment, let alone charge him or even identify him by name. But as The Plain Dealer found, Neiheiser contributed $250 to FitzGeralds political campaign the following month. And in June 2008, the Lakewood City Council unanimously agreed at FitzGeralds urging to lease the ice rink to a Neiheiser company. FitzGerald and those who served on the Lakewood council at the time defended the deal as a smart financial move for the city. The lease called for Neiheisers company to operate the rink and pay the city about $75,000 a year in rent. Neiheisers attorney told The Plain Dealer in 2010 that his client had spent more than $2 million to refurbish the city-owned complex. Matt Dolan, the Republican nominee for county executive in 2010, raised questions about FitzGeralds involvement in the Dimora deal and branded his opponent as Public Official 14. FitzGerald rid his war chest of contributions from Dimora, Neiheiser and others caught up in the investigation by making a charitable donation. And after beating Dolan and taking office as county executive he rid the county payroll of many patronage hires loyal to Dimoras political machine. But in January, FitzGeralds name again surfaced in a case, this time at a trial for another crooked contractor, Michael Forlani. An FBI agent testified that Forlani used two intermediaries in 2008 to disguise his campaign contributions to the then-mayor. FitzGerald told The Plain Dealer at the time that the agents testimony was the first he had heard of the donations. Then came an extraordinary announcement from Ann Rowland, the lead prosecutor in the corruption case. In a statement U.S. attorneys rarely make, Rowland cleared FitzGerald. Ed FitzGerald is not a target of the investigation, Rowland said. We have no evidence Ed FitzGerald knew Michael Forlani had anything to do with these contributions. After seeing Coxs statement last week on FitzGerald, PolitiFact Ohio asked RGA spokesman Jon Thompson to specify what the group meant by FitzGeralds brand of pay-to-play and corruption politics. Thompson specified the Public Official 14 designation. Thompson also noted that the Ohio GOP has tied FitzGerald to the corruption probe. And he shared a link to the conservative Third Base Politics blog, which reported that the left-leaning Plunderbund blog had deleted posts from 2010 that presented FitzGerald as Public Official 14. So, lets review. Cox accused FitzGerald of perpetuating a brand of pay-to-play and corruption politics. More than 60 other public officials, government employees and contractors have been convicted of charges stemming from the federal investigation. But the agents and prosecutors who tore up county government never accused FitzGerald of a crime. And though FitzGerald has surfaced a couple of times in the investigation, the lead prosecutor has said he is not under suspicion. The brand in question is one Republicans no doubt prefer as they gear up for Kasichs re-election battle. But they have no proof that FitzGerald engaged in corrupt politics. And they misleadingly hide behind the cryptic and nuanced Public Official 14 designation while ignoring the much more direct and meaningful exculpatory statement from the lead prosecutor. They also ignore the work FitzGerald has done to clean up after the corrupt regime that preceded him. Facts lay waste to any effort like this one that explicitly brands FitzGerald as a corrupt politician. Pants On Fire!",0.2,0.8,0.7,0.9308573089

Thousands of Syrian refugees are pouring into our country, thanks to President Obama, Beruff said in an Aug. 8 Facebook post. This is an open invitation to acts of terror. Even the director of the FBI said that we cannot properly vet people coming from the Middle East. Immigration has been a major focus of this election cycle, with Republicans routinely calling for more restrictions to ensure security in the United States. But did James Comey actually say the FBI cannot properly vet people coming from the Middle East? No, he didnt. Beruff is distorting a point Comey was making about a flaw in the vetting process, but he was reiterating the system in place was actually much better than it had been in years past. No guarantees When we asked Beruffs campaign what Comey said and when, his spokesman sent us a YouTube clip of Comey speaking before the House Homeland Security Committee on Oct. 21, 2015. A topic at the meeting was the thoroughness of background checks for refugees — specifically some 10,000 Syrian refugees slated to come to the United States. The Syrian refugee focus was much more specific than people coming from the Middle East, as Beruff said. Lets be clear: The United States can vet refugees through a process that involves the FBI, plus the State Department, the Department of Homeland Security, the Department of Defense and other agencies. The vetting process can take two or even three years, in which refugees undergo several rounds of security clearance checks. Because of the overt concern about terrorism, Syrian refugees actually have to go through extra hurdles. Experts have told us repeatedly that refugee background checks are the most extensive security screening the country has for any type of visitor. At the committee meeting, U.S. Rep. Bennie Thompson, D-Miss., asked Comey if there was concern that the FBI could miss a potential terrorist infiltrator because intelligence databases may not contain complete information on every refugee. Comey agreed, saying the procedure isnt perfect, because it relies on checking for criminal records or other nefarious activity. We can only query against that which we have collected, Comey said. If someone has never made a ripple in the pond in Syria in a way that would get their identity or their interest reflected in our database, we can query our database until the cows come home but we are not going to — there will be nothing show up because we have no record on that person. So while the process is very thorough, Comey was saying he couldnt guarantee there would never be a problem and no terrorist could ever slip through the cracks. Thats just the way it is. Comey noted that when the United States performed background checks on Iraqi refugees, they had a much larger database because of the American presence there over the last decade. Not having the same intelligence infrastructure in Syria has resulted in much less information with which to cross-reference an applicant. As Secretary of Homeland Security,Jeh Johnson said during the same hearing that a refugee may have a criminal past thats unknown, or may suddenly commit a terrorist act after entering the United States. But even with the pitfalls of admitting refugees from war-torn regions, Comey said, the process works and has been improving over the years. The good news is we are much better doing it than eight years ago, Comey told U.S. Rep Jeff Duncan, R-S.C., later in the hearing. The bad news is, there is no risk-free process. Comey was echoing concerns he voiced to the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee on Oct. 8. There is risk associated with bringing anybody in from the outside, but especially from a conflict zone like that, he told the Senate committee. From the intelligence community's perspective, as I said, I think we've developed an effective way to touch all of our databases and resources to figure out what we know about individuals.  I don't think that's a cumbersome process. My concern there is that there are certain gaps. He repeated that sentiment to the House Judiciary Committee on Oct. 22. We have gotten much better as an intelligence community at joining our efforts and checking our databases in a way that gives us high confidence. If we have a record on somebody, it will surface. That's the good news, Comey said. The challenge we face with Syria is that we don't have that rich set of data. So even though we've gotten better at querying what we have, we certainly will have less overall. And so as I said to a question earlier, someone only alerts as a result of our searches if we have some record on them. That's the challenge we face with Syria. Our ruling Beruff said, The director of the FBI said that we cannot properly vet people coming from the Middle East. Comey, while talking specifically about Syrian refugees and not all of the Middle East, has repeatedly said that admitting refugees has its challenges and that information gaps do exist. But he also has expressed confidence in the admission procedure and says it continues to improve. That makes it hard to argue Comey feels like the governments process cannot properly vet people.",0.4,0.6,0.9,0.3756615318

And under those circumstances, they were not entitled to the normal kinds of courtesies and treatment.","Former Vice President Dick Cheney has had a relatively quiet couple of years since leaving the White House. But with the recent release of a Senate report on alleged torture by the CIA, it was inevitable that Cheney -- who is closely associated with the post-9/11 policy of enhanced interrogations for captured terrorists -- would return to television screens. On Dec. 9, the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence released a report about the CIAs interrogation techniques in the wake of 9/11. About 500 pages of the 6,700-page report were made public. The report concluded that the techniques were not an effective way to gain intelligence from detainees, and that the CIA misled Congress and the White House. The report detailed such techniques as rectal rehydration and the use of coffin-size confinement boxes. A few days before a scheduled appearance on NBCs Meet the Press, Cheney sat for an interview with Fox News Bret Baier. Heres a portion of their exchange on Dec. 10, focusing on the fate of the detainees discussed in the Senate report. Baier: Is there anything to the Geneva Convention, to the world rule of law on this? Cheney: Sure there is. But remember, the terrorists were not covered by the Geneva Convention. They were unlawful combatants. And under those circumstances, they were not entitled to the normal kinds of courtesies and treatment you would accord to those. Theres significant disagreement between Cheney and his critics on the issue of torture or enhanced interrogation techniques. Still, experts told us that the question of what protections, if any, the detainees qualified for under the Geneva Convention -- is somewhat more clear-cut than other aspects of this policy debate. So well take a closer look at Cheneys claim that terrorist detainees were not covered by the Geneva Convention. They were unlawful combatants. And under those circumstances, they were not entitled to the normal kinds of courtesies and treatment. The Geneva Conventions First, some background on the Geneva Conventions. They are a group of four international treaties covering different aspects of how civilians, prisoners of war and soldiers are to be treated once they are rendered incapable of fighting. (Read more about them here.) The most recent version of the treaties in force date from 1949; the United States has ratified all four though it has not ratified some of the protocols added later. The conventions guarantee a certain level of protection for former combatants, including prisoners of war and civilians. They set out in detail the requirements for food, clothing, shelter, safety from combat, access to medical care, and other matters. However, whether fighters could qualify for these protections depended on whether they adhered to some basic rules of law such as wearing uniforms, carrying arms openly, answering to a chain of command, and not committing war crimes. Many of those who would one day end up in Guantanamo Bay and other sites were from non-state terrorist groups and did not adhere to these rules. So these fighters were not guaranteed the same protections afforded POWs. Cheneys strongest point in his interview with Baier was to draw this distinction between prisoners of war, who receive these extensive protections, and unlawful combatants, who do not. There is, in fact, a distinction in the level of protection. What undercuts the accuracy of Cheneys claim, however, is a different part of what he said. Its misleading for him to say that such combatants are not covered by the Geneva Convention. While detainees who do not have POW status dont get the top level of protection, they do get more basic protections from the Geneva Conventions. And glossing over those less-stringent protections hides an important point: Even the lower level of protection would have shielded detainees, at least on paper, against some of the harsh treatments now alleged in the Senate report. Experts pointed us to identical passages in each of the four conventions, known as Common Article 3. Among other thingsprohibited at any time and in any place whatsoever by Common Article 3 are violence to life and person, in particular murder of all kinds, mutilation, cruel treatment and torture as well as outrages upon personal dignity, in particular humiliating and degrading treatment. In other words, despite the implications from what Cheney said, even unlawful combatants have minimum protections under the Geneva Conventions, Richard D. Rosen, director of the Center for Military Law & Policy at Texas Tech University Law School. The Hamdan decision In the immediate aftermath of 9/11, there was considerable debate inside and outside the Bush administration about how captured members of al-Qaida and the Taliban should be treated. The Bushadministration contended that the Geneva Conventions did not apply to terrorism suspects held abroad,siding with White House and Pentagon lawyers over objections from the State Department. Administration lawyers also approved the enhanced interrogation techniques and said they were legally permissible. The debate about the Geneva Convention piece of the equationended in June 2006, when the U.S. Supreme Court issued its ruling in Hamdan vs. Rumsfeld, a watershed case on detainee rights. The 5-3 majority wrote that Common Article 3 affords some minimal protection, falling short of full protection under the Conventions, to individuals associated with neither a signatory nor even a nonsignatory who are involved in a conflict 'in the territory of' a signatory. In other words, by this decision, our own Supreme Court has made it completely clear that, whatever their status, (detainees) are entitled to some minimal protections under the Geneva Convention, said Steven R. Ratner, a University of Michigan law professor. That ruling is binding law in the United States, no matter what the former vice president says. University of Notre Dame law professor Mary Ellen OConnell, a specialist on international law, agreed. The Supreme Court's ruling in Hamdan conflicts directly with the vice presidents assertion, she said. We will also note that while Common Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions is one source of basic protection for detainees, their rights to these protections may be bolstered by other international agreements as well. One is Article 75 of Additional Protocol I of the Geneva Conventions, which includes minimal protections for all people, whatever their status, who are caught in a conflict. While the U.S. has not ratified this protocol, the U.S. government has said that, out of a sense of legal obligation it will adhere to Article 75 for any individual it detains in an international armed conflict, and expects all other nations to adhere to these principles as well. And despite resistance during the Bush administration, two other international agreements to which the United States is a party -- the 1984 Torture Convention and the 1966 International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights -- would also prohibit torture and cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment, experts said.  Our ruling Cheney said that terrorist detainees were not covered by the Geneva Convention. They were unlawful combatants. And under those circumstances, they were not entitled to the normal kinds of courtesies and treatment. Cheney has a point that unlawful combatants are not afforded as high a level of protection as prisoners of war or civilians. However, his comment glosses over the fact that unlawful combatants are still accorded a minimum degree of protection, including a ban on violence to life and person, in particular murder of all kinds, mutilation, cruel treatment and torture, and outrages upon personal dignity, in particular humiliating and degrading treatment, both of which have been validated by the Supreme Court. This is an important omission, since some of these very actions have been alleged in the Senate report.",0.6,0.5,0.7,0.8912543121

John McCain said as recently as a couple of weeks ago he wouldn't even sit down with the government of Spain, a NATO ally that has troops in Afghanistan with us now. I find that incredible, Biden said. Biden was referring to an interview McCain gave with Radio Caracol in Miami on Sept. 17 in which McCain was asked if he would invite José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, the Spanish prime minister,to the White House. McCain's tangled and somewhat confused response prompted lots of criticism. Democrats said it illustrated reluctance by the Bush administration— and now McCain— to engage in diplomacy even with longtime allies. Here's the relevant portion of the interview: Q: Senator, finally, lets talk about Spain. If youre elected president, would you be willing to invite President José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero to the White House, to meet with you? A: I would be willing to meet with those leaders who are our friends and want to work with us in a cooperative fashion. And by the way, President Calderón of Mexico is fighting a very, very tough fight against the drug cartels. Im glad were now working in cooperation with the Mexican government on the Merida plan, and I intend to move forward with the relations and invite as many of them as I can of those leaders to the White House. Q: Would that invitation be extended to the Zapatero government? To the president, itself? A: Uh, I dont, you know, honestly, I have to look at the relations and the situations and the priorities, but I can assure you: I will establish closer relations with our friends, and I will stand up to those who want to do harm to the United States of America. I know how to do both. Q: So, you have to wait and see if hes willing to, to meet with you, or you be able to do it? In the White House? A: Well, again I, I dont All I can tell you is that I have a clear record of working with leaders in the hemisphere that are friends with us, and standing up to those who are not, and thats judged on the basis of the importance of our relationship with Latin America, and the entire region. Q: OK, what about Europe? Im talking about the President of Spain. Are you willing to meet with him, if youre elected president? A: Im willing to meet with any leader who is dedicated to the same principles and philosophy that we are for human rights, democracy and freedom. And I will stand up to those that do not. McCain's reluctance to meet with Zapatero was odd because Spain is a member of NATO and a longtime U.S. ally. The CIA World Factbook calls it a global champion of freedom. The U.S. State Department says Spain and the United States have a long history of official relations and are closely associated in many fields. But it's worth noting that U.S.-Spain relations have suffered since Zapatero became prime minister in 2004 and withdrew Spanish troops that were helping the U.S. war in Iraq. We listened to the McCain interview several times and got the impression that the senator was confused during the first few questions. The interviewer says Zapatero's name quickly and it seemed to us that McCain did not recognize the name. His answer suggests he is focused on other leaders from Latin America. But the interviewer seems to notice his confusion and reminds him OK, what about Europe? Im talking about the president of Spain. But McCain's reply does not suggest that registered with him and he offers a more general reply about meeting with any leader who is dedicated to the same principles and philosophy that we are. We would have accepted a McCain-was-confused explanation for this one, but when the issue first came up during the campaign, the McCain campaign sent reporters a statement from foreign policy adviser Randy Scheunemann that said McCain's answer was intentional. The questioner asked several times about Senator McCain's willingness to meet Zapatero— and id'd him in the question so there is no doubt Senator McCain knew exactly to whom the question referred. Senator McCain refused to commit to a White House meeting with President Zapatero in this interview, Scheunemann said in an e-mail sent to theWashington Postand CNN. Scheunemann said that if elected, McCain will meet with a wide range of allies in a wide variety of venues but is not going to spell out scheduling and meeting location specifics in advance. To us, McCain seemed confused. But Scheunemann's statement is adamant that McCain knew the subject was Spain. As a result, his comment that I have to look at the relations and the situations and the priorities indicates at least some doubt about U.S.-Spanish relations. Which bring us back to Biden's statement. Biden said, John McCain said as recently as a couple of weeks ago he wouldn't even sit down with the government of Spain, a NATO ally that has troops in Afghanistan with us now. Our reading of the interview is that McCain won't commit himself in advance to meeting or not meeting with the government of Spain. That's very different from refusing to meet with Spain. Biden could have criticized McCain for that noncommittal stance and been more accurate. But instead Biden took it a step further and said McCain refused outright to meet with Spain.",0.5,0.5,0.9,0.9606409435

Six months later, a livestreamed but opaque audit of ballots from the states most populous county is under way in a 14,870-seat arena. And posts on social media falsely suggest that the audit showed Trump was overtaking Biden. A widely shared Instagram post claimed: Preliminary audit showed Trump ahead by 250,000. Now as it nears completion nearly 950,000 ballots are declared illegal. Nearly all for Biden. The post was flagged as part of Facebooks efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Theres no preliminary results, Ken Bennett, Arizonas former secretary of state and a liaison for the Senate Republicans who ordered the audit, told PolitiFact on May 6. Theres no such finding. Theres been no findings released to either of those effects. The audit, begun April 23, will likely to continue for at least 60 days, Bennett said. He added that under the contract for the audit, no preliminary findings are to be released. A spokesperson for the audit did not reply to our email. Final official results of the November election showed Biden beat Trump in Maricopa County, 1,040,774 votes to 995,665, or by about 2% of the vote. So the Instagram claim would have you believe that the audit found roughly 90% of Bidens votes were illegal. The Maricopa audit was ordered up by Republican state senators, even though the original result has been validated by a hand-count sample audit and a forensic audit of tabulation equipment that found no abnormalities. The GOP hired a team that included Cyber Ninjas, a Florida-based technology company lacking election audit experience. Cyber Ninjas is headed by Doug Logan, who promoted stop the steal conspiracy theories about the election that culminated in the Jan. 6 Capitol attack. The conservative One America News Network, which has aired falsehoods about the 2020 election, set up a nine-camera livestream for the audit, which is being conducted at Veterans Memorial Coliseum in Phoenix. But Cyber Ninjas policies and procedures were released only after a judge ruled that the firm couldnt keep them secret. Reporters initially were restricted from taking notes or filing reports. The false claim follows others that weve debunked about purported findings from the audit. We also rated False a claim that the audit is confirming the rumors that real ballots have a special watermark.

Of course, theres been a buzz surrounding them ever since the gubernatorial campaign in 2010 when now-Gov. John Kitzhaber and his Republican opponent sparred over just how much to adjust the states rate.Now, the jockeying has been left to lawmakers who have crafted at least three bills amending the tax to various degrees. At a recent hearing on the bills, Rep. Tobias Read, who favors something of a moderate approach, noted that having a capital gains tax that can, at the highest bracket, reach 11 percent is a barrier for some.Having a rate that puts us near the top or at the top of the list makes it more difficult for us as a state to get to the rest of the discussion about the other great things that are in Oregon, he said.This is something wed heard before -- that Oregons rate was one of, if not the, highest in the nation. But when he said it, it occurred to us, wed never actually checked to see if that were the case. So we set off to correct that oversight.To start, we contacted Chris Allanach, a senior economist with the House Revenue Committee (the committee where Tobias made his remarks). Allanach said that to the best of his knowledge, Read was onto something -- not only is it among the highest rates, he said, but as far as I can tell, it is (the highest).(He did caution that this was set to change pretty soon here. When voters approved Measures 66 and 67, they voted to decrease the top income tax rate from 11 percent to 9.9 percent. That means, as of Jan. 1, 2012, the maximum capital gains tax rate will also be 9.9 percent.)Allanach cited his source as the Federation of Tax Administrators. We went to that site and looked up a comparative table of state income tax brackets. Indeed, it showed that as of Jan. 1, 2011, Oregon was tied with Hawaii for the highest rate at the upper bracket -- 11 percent.Generally speaking, a states capital gains tax rate is only as high as its highest income tax rate. In fact, states often keep it lower than that as an incentive of sorts, Allanach said. That seemed reasonable, but we wanted to make sure that there wasnt a state out there that might have an unconventional tax rate.So, we dialed up Ronald Alt, senior research associate with the Federation of Tax Administrators, and asked if he knew of any states that went higher with their capital gains than they do with their income tax. It turns out one does: Massachusetts.Massachusetts makes a distinction between short term (those held for less than a year) and long term corporate gains. For the former, the state charges a rate of 12 percent.Where does all that leave us?Well, Read was right -- were among the highest in the nation. If you dont count Massachusetts system, we tie for the No. 1 spot. Even when 2012 rolls around and the rate drops to 9.9 percent, Oregon will still rank as one of the highest -- second only to Hawaii (and, in some cases, Massachusetts).

Scott Walker raises the pay of inmates, but we don't raise the pay of staff in our correctional institutions.","Wisconsin state employees union leader Marty Beil is no fan of Gov. Scott Walker. And his criticism has not relented since Walker survived an historic recall election in June 2012.Beil took aim at Walker on July 19, 2012 in an interview with John Sly Sylvester, a liberal radio talk show host on WTDY AM-FM in Madison.Walker raises the pay of inmates, Beil complained, but we don't raise the pay of staff in our correctional institutions.In 2011, Walker curbed state employees collective bargaining powers and cut their take-home pay by forcing them to pay more for their pensions and health insurance. He also put tighter restrictions on overtime for corrections workers.But has the Republican governor increased the pay of inmates who work in prisons, yet not given raises to the officers who work there?Beil's evidenceBeil is executive director of the Madison-based Council 24 of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees union, which represents corrections officers and a variety of other state employees.Asked for evidence to back his claim, he forwarded to us a May 2012 email from Lizzie Tegels, warden of the New Lisbon Correctional Institution, a 500-cell, medium-security prison 80 miles northwest of Madison.It says the prison would no longer pay a lower wage to inmates during their first 60 days of work. Paying new inmate workers a few pennies per hour less during their probationary period costs more -- in staff time to adjust pay rates -- than if the inmates received the regular wage, the email said.So, this isnt giving any working inmates a pay raise. Rather, inmates new to working would get a higher starting wage than they would have previously, but only during their first two months on the job.Beil told us the change wasn't occurring only at New Lisbon, but suggested we contact the Department of Corrections for details.Since Beil's claim was aimed at Walker, we contacted the governor's office, as well as the Department of Corrections. Walker spokesman Cullen Werwie and DOC spokeswoman Linda Eggert confirmed that corrections employees have not received a general raise since Walker took office in January 2011.Indeed, lawmakers in November 2011 imposed a two-year pay freeze on state employees, although merit raises can be given.So, the second part of Beils claim, that corrections workers havent gotten any raises under Walker, is correct. DOC response As for inmate pay, the governors spokesman provided a response written by the office of Corrections Secretary Gary Hamblin.According to the memo:Wisconsin prisons can pay working inmates a lower wage during their probation period, but most don't; neither does Badger State Industries, which oversees the manufacturing of license plates and other goods made by inmates.Eliminating the lower pay rate at New Lisbon means that current and future workers now start at the regular pay grade. That ranges from 9 to 42 cents an hour (and 1 to 20 cents through Badger State Industries). About 1,000 inmates work at New Lisbon, with about 20 to 25 on probationary status at any given time.Eggert said DOC surveyed all prisons after we contacted her and found that none had given inmates any raises or eliminated lower probationary rates like New Lisbon did.So, the higher pay rate is limited to the relatively few working inmates at one prison, and only applies to their first two months on the job.Our ratingBeil said Walker has raised the pay of working inmates, but we don't raise the pay of staff in our correctional institutions. Neither group, however, has received a pay raise.The pay rate at one prison is now higher for new workers during their two-month probation period, but that was done not to give inmates raises but to save money for taxpayers.",0.4,0.7,0.9,0.9377625418

David Cicilline is responsible for the federal loan guarantee to Solyndra, the failed solar company","Theres been a lot of finger-pointing lately in Washington over the Obama administrations 2009 decision to give a $535-million federal loan guarantee to Solyndra, a now-defunct solar power manufacturer.The Republican-controlled House has launched an investigation into how the Department of Energy could guarantee such a large loan to a company that would file for bankruptcy only two and a half years later. What sort of examination of the California start-up companys finances did the government do before taking such a big risk?According to a news release we received the other day, the National Republican Congressional Committee has found a scapegoat for the debacle: U.S. Rep. David N. Cicilline, Democrat of Rhode Island.Once the poster child for David Cicilline's stimulus boondoggle, the bankrupt Solyndra company is now a symbol of how his failed scheme wasted taxpayer money on political payback and failing companies instead of creating the jobs promised, the Jan. 13 release said.The NRCC sent out the release in response to a Washington Times report that senior Solyndra executives were set to receive bonuses despite the companys troubles.Its outrageous enough that David Cicilline supported a $1-trillion failed stimulus package, but its even more outrageous that hundreds of millions were spent to fund a failing company like Solyndra, NRCC communications director Paul Lindsay went on to say in the release. Not only is Cicilline responsible for this irresponsible investment, but hell also have to explain to his Rhode Island constituents why Solyndras senior employees are receiving bonuses at the expense of hard-working American taxpayers.Weve heard a lot of allegations in connection to Solyndras problems, but never one laying the blame at Cicillines doorstep. This puzzled us because Cicilline took office in 2011, well after the federal stimulus package that financed Solyndras loan guarantee was passed and well after the decision was made to award Solyndra the loan guarantee. How could he be responsible?We checked the NRCCs website and saw that the same news release had been sent out to 49 other Congressional districts, but each time, the name of the Democrat in office was inserted where Cicillines name was. (The Democrats included Rep. Bill Keating, of Massachusetts, who also took office in 2011).We then called the organization seeking an explanation of how Cicilline made it on the list. (Curiously, Rep. James R. Langevin, Rhode Islands other congressman who is also a Democrat, wasnit on the list even though he was in office at the time the stimulus bill was passed and voted for it.)An NRCC spokesman said the release was accurate because Cicilline voiced support for the stimulus package when he was campaigning for Congress.I think the important thing to note is we didnt say Cicilline voted for the stimulus, Nat Sillin said. We say he supported it.Its true that Cicilline did back the stimulus package. When he was mayor of Providence, he was quoted numerous times saying that the bill would create sorely needed jobs.And although its technically true that the release didnt say that Cicilline voted for the stimulus, it did say that hes responsible. That didnt add up to us. Lets run through some dates to make it clear why:Feb. 13, 2009: Congress passes the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. Under the $787-billion stimulus package, Solyndra received its loan guarantee.March 20, 2009: Solyndra receives conditional approval for the loan guarantee, according to a timeline from the Department of Energ,.Sept. 3, 2009: The Department of Energy makes the final decision to approve the loan guarantee for Solyndra.Nov. 2, 2010: Cicilline elected to Congress.Jan. 5, 2011: Cicilline takes office.Our rulingThe full name of the legislation under which the stimulus package was approved gives this one away -- the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009.Cicilline took office in January 2011, a full 23 months after passage of the bill enacting the loan guarantee program that benefited Solyndra.The National Republican Congressional Committee has every right to call the stimulus a boondoggle. And its fair to say that Cicilline supported the stimulus before taking office.But Lindsay said that Cicilline is responsible for this irresponsible investment. No, hes not.Wed say that Lindsay and the National Republican Congressional Committee simply used overheated rhetoric, but thats an understatement. Their claim is so wildly inaccurate that we give it a Pants on Fire. (Get updates from PolitiFactRI on Twitter.

But is it fiscally defensible to crow about funding education and nursing homes in this tight budget cycle?To our inquiry, Straus spokeswoman Tracy Young pointed out that specific numbers wouldnt be available until the inked deal was published as the proposed budget. In the meantime, we turned to news reports on the budget deal, which was reached months after the state comptrollers revenue forecast for 2012-13 left lawmakers grappling with a projected shortfall of more than $20 billion to maintain existing spending or services.First, lets look at the public schools.The Austin American-Statesman noted May 24 that the agreement gives public school districts $4 billion less in 2012-13 than they would get under current law. Lynn Moak, a lobbyist whose clients include an alliance of large school districts, told us it allocates about $37 billion to districts -- less money for schools than schools were counting on under the normal school formula process. But Moak said districts will be a lot better off than they would have been under the first House-approved budget, which would have given the schools at least $7.8 billion less than they stood to draw under existing formulas.And state support for higher education? Overall, the agreement cuts that funding about 10 percent in 2012-13, the Dallas Morning News reported May 23. Specifics include: a 25 percent reduction in a fund to help universities reach elite status as research institutions; a 5 percent cut in general academic funding formulas and a 10 percent cut in funding for the states nine health science centers, the newspaper said.Also, the number of Texas college students getting state-backed scholarships will drop by 41,000 from the 153,738 students now getting that aid, the News reported. Thats a 25 percent hit. That includes 29,000 fewer poor and lower-midde-income students who will receive TEXAS Grants, intended for poor and lower-middle-income children.Then again, the budget deal protects formula funding and scholarships at community colleges, state Rep. Dan Branch, R-Dallas told the Morning News.We ran the higher education numbers by the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board, whose spokesman, Dominic Chavez, said state aid to higher ed is actually slated to drop about 8 percent in 2012-13. He said all state-backed college financial aid will decrease 23 percent, with 43,258 fewer students benefiting.To gauge funding for nursing homes, we contacted the Texas Association of Homes and Services for the Aging, which advocates at the Capitol for about 100 nonprofit nursing homes. Spokesman David Thomason said the budget agreement maintains an already-imposed 3 percent reduction in the rate paid for serving nursing-home residents on Medicaid -- more than erasing the 2.7 percent rate increase approved by the 2009 Legislature.Thomason said the association doesnt expect homes to close due to the lowered Medicaid rate, but he predicted staffing reductions and fewer nursing-home slots available to Texans on Medicaid.Summing up, public schools stand to field $4 billion less in 2012-13 than they would have gotten under current law. Higher education, except for community colleges, is likewise due to sustain funding cuts plus a drop in state-supported scholarships. Nursing homes are left with lower rates than they had after the 2009 legislative session.Straus is correct the agreed-upon budget funds these items, but his statement fails to acknowledge the funding is mostly at lower levels than before. Thats vital missing context.",0.8,0.4,0.9,0.7908548451

Any changes -- taken down, or even at half-staff, if that can be done -- must be passed by a supermajority of the General Assembly.","The massacre of nine African-Americans at a Charleston, S.C., church June 17 has renewed calls to remove a Confederate battle flag flying at the South Carolina statehouse. The NAACP, which has long requested the flags removal from a monument to Confederate soldiers at the statehouse in Columbia, reiterated its call this week, joined by countless politicians and almost 400,000 petitioners. Hundreds marched June 21 in South Carolina cities to protest the flag remaining unfurled on government property. One of the oddities is that while the U.S. and South Carolina flags are flying at half-staff, the Confederate flag remains at full-staff. CNN reporter Jean Casarez explained the situation to viewers on June 21. By law, it must fly at a height of 30 feet, she said. Any changes — taken down, or even at half-staff, if that can be done — must be passed by a supermajority of the General Assembly. Weve seen many versions of this claim, so we wanted to give it a closer look. South Carolinas Code of Laws allows the governor to order the lowering of the state and U.S. flags flying atop the capitol building to half-staff, which Gov. Nikki Haley has done. But according to her spokesperson, its the Legislature, not the governor, who has the legal authority to alter the Confederate flag. Title 1 Chapter 10 of state law spells it out: The flag authorized to be flown at a designated location on the grounds of the Capitol Complex is the South Carolina Infantry Battle Flag of the Confederate States of America. This flag must be flown on a flagpole located at a point on the south side of the Confederate Soldier Monument, centered on the monument, 10 feet from the base of the monument at a height of 30 feet. The provisions of this section may only be amended or repealed upon passage of an act which has received a two-thirds vote on the third reading of the bill in each branch of the General Assembly. The two-thirds vote applies to both permanent changes and temporary adjustments alike, according to the Democratic State Rep. James E. Smith, who doubts the laws constitutionality and whos been working on removing the flag since it was first moved to the grounds. The Confederate flag has been displayed at its current location since 2000, when the state passed the Heritage Act, a compromise that removed the flag from its place of sovereignty atop the capitol but allowed it to remain on the grounds. (The same piece of legislation also requires a two-third'svote by the General Assembly to make changes to Civil Rights monuments.) While the flag can be lowered physically, no one we spoke to could recall a time -- be it Memorial Day or 9/11 -- when it wasnt flying at full-staff. Its not a flag of sovereignty, its a veterans battle flag.  Should that flag be on the dome, which it should, it would be lowered, but its not, said Thomas Leland Summers, commander of the South Carolina division of the Sons of Confederate Veterans, who noted that the Confederate flag wasnt lowered to honor Civil War anniversaries. Smith, a Democratic state lawmaker, agreed, but also said: Thats beside the point. It shouldnt be flying anyway. If we were to lower it, it would give it the status of a sovereign flag, a status greater than it deserves. It should just be furled. Republican State Rep. Norman Doug Brannon told MSNBC on June 19 that he plans to sponsor a bill to remove the flag in the next legislative session. Most likely, Brannon wont be the only one, said Statehouse Report editor and publisher Andy Brack. (Smith says he wants to do better than supermajority, hed like a unanimous vote.) These deaths — especially of one of their own (Democratic State Sen. Clementa Pinckney) — might be the best chance in a decade to get the flag out of a place of prominence, Brack said. If the issue becomes a hot-button issue — so hot that legislators fear they'll lose their seats or face a challenger in the primaries for doing nothing — they could move promptly. They moved with the legislative equivalent of light speed after the death of Walter Scott in April and by June passed a bill to help pay for body cameras for police. The atmosphere is changing it appears, said Don Gordon, political science professor at Furman University in Greenville. The attempts to remove the flag from visibility off Gervais Street in front of the Capital may gain traction. The pictures on the shooter's Last Rhodesian website and the clearly racist message some feel have moved the flag from a symbol of heritage to one of blatant hate, a shifting symbolism. Our ruling A CNN reporter said, By law, (the Confederate flag at the South Carolina Capitol) must fly at a height of 30 feet. Any changes -- taken down, or even at half-staff, if that can be done -- must be passed by a supermajority of the general assembly. In 2000, South Carolina passed legislation that mandated the flags location, a height of 30 feet, and a supermajority vote to make any changes. The Confederate flag has never been removed or, to our knowledge, lowered since it was raised on the Confederate Soldiers Monument on the capitol grounds.",1,0,1,0.2307410739

Johnny Isakson has never proposed, nor voted in favor of, a substantial cut in federal spending and has voted for many substantial increases in federal spending.","Note to readers: a letter to the editor responding to this item appeared Oct. 11, 2010. The letter appears at the end of the article. Chuck Donovan gave us a challenge.The Libertarian nominee for Georgia's U.S. Senate seat asked AJC PolitiFact Georgia to check out some claims on his campaign website about the incumbent, Sen. Johnny Isakson, R-Ga. Voters will decide among Isakson, Donovan and Democrat Michael Thurmond on Nov. 2.We looked at Donovan's blog, which included a post called Isakson's Inconsistencies. The post challenged the Republican on a host of issues, but one line questioning Isakson's conservative credentials on federal spending stood out.Mr. Isakson has never proposed, nor voted in favor of, a substantial cut in federal spending, Donovan began. However, he has voted in favor of: (a) many substantial increases in federal spending; and (b) tremendous annual deficits.Challenge accepted.Isakson spokeswoman Sheridan Watson showed us a page on the senator's website full of news releases and statements highlighting votes and bills he supported to curb spending. It also noted Isakson has twice won the Taxpayers' Friend Award from the National Taxpayers Union for his efforts to curb federal spending.Happy investigating, Watson wrote us.Donovan's post was researched and written by fellow Libertarian Allen Buckley, an Atlanta-based attorney and certified public accountant who won 2 percent of the vote in an unsuccessful campaign against Isakson in 2004.Let's look at the first part of Donovan's claim: Isakson has never proposed or voted for a substantial cut in federal spending.The senator's website offers four main arguments to dispute Donovan. Isakson has voted often to cap discretionary spending, programs that are not entitlements such as Medicare and Social Security. Discretionary spending, which includes the Defense Department budget, has amounted to about as much as 40 percent of the total federal budget in recent years. Second, the senator has been a big proponent of biennial budgeting, preparing and adopting budgets for two-year periods. The federal budget is currently adopted on an annual basis. Biennial budgeting proponents argue the idea would allow the federal government to adopt two budgets in one year and spend the second year taking more time to improve how government works. Others, including the Congressional Budget Office, have warned biennial budgeting could backfire if the revenue streams are uncertain, which makes it difficult to budget accurately.Third, Isakson supports the Pay It Back Act, which would require that money repaid by banks and other businesses who received taxpayer dollars from the Troubled Assets Relief Program (TARP) be used toward deficit reduction.The fourth idea is legislation introduced in 2006 and 2007 by U.S. Sen. Judd Gregg, R-N.H., called Stop Over-Spending. Isakson co-sponsored the bill. SOS aimed to reduce the federal deficit and essentially balance the budget by 2012 through slowing the rate of growth for entitlement programs, except for Social Security, if Congress doesn't meet deficit reduction targets. It also gave the president a line-item veto. The Senate never voted on the bill.The SOS bill received positive reviews from the conservative organizations National Review and the Heritage Foundation, saying it would have forced Congress into disciplined spending. University of Virginia political science professor James Savage was one of the few academics who studied the bill when it was introduced and he had problems with it. Savage and others contend that deficit reduction is not sound economic policy during a recession because more federal investment is needed to revive the economy, either through cutting taxes, lowering interest rates or spurring consumer spending through a stimulus. Now, let's look at whether Isakson has voted in favor of many substantial spending increases.Donovan's camp says Isakson went along with Republicans on a series of spending increases when the GOP controlled Congress. Much of Donovan's argument on this point deals with bills from 2001 to 2004, when Isakson was in the U.S. House. During that time, Isakson voted for several bills during a time when the gross federal debt grew from about $5.8 trillion at the end of fiscal year 2001 to nearly $7.4 trillion by the end of fiscal year 2004. The debt was projected to rise to $13.8 trillion for the fiscal year that ended Sept. 30. Isakson voted in 2002 to spend $350 billion over 10 years for a prescription drug benefit for Medicare. Additionally, he voted for bills that increased defense spending by about 10 percent a year and legislation that raised the discretionary spending cap from $661 billion in 2001 to $819 billion in 2004. The senator has been more of a fiscal hawk since Democrats became the majority party in Congress in 2007, Donovan said.The senator voted in 2006 with 51 of his 54 fellow Republicans to increase the national debt limit by $787 billion, raising the debt ceiling to $9 trillion. Some senators defended the decision, saying additional funds were needed for health and education programs. Isakson also voted in 2008 for the $700 billion TARP but has since criticized expansion of that legislation.So where does this leave us on Donovan's statement about Isakson? The October 1, 2010 truth-o-meter says an allegation made on the website of Chuck Donovan, Libertarian Party U.S. Senate candidate, is half true. The article notes that I researched and wrote the provision—which is correct. The provision reads: Mr. Isakson never proposed, nor voted in favor of, a substantial cut in federal spending; however, he has voted in favor of: (a) many substantial increases in federal spending; and (b) tremendous annual deficits. The article did not consider the four facets of the statement, but instead focused on spending. The allegedly untrue part is the part about Mr. Isaksons proposals relating to, and votes for, substantially cutting spending. Cited in favor of Mr. Isakson are proposed caps on discretionary spending, Mr. Isaksons support for biennial budgeting and Mr. Isaksons support of the Pay It Back Act, which reportedly requires money paid back by banks and other businesses who received taxpayer dollars from the TARP be used towards deficit reduction. These things are not bad things, but they do not reduce spending at all. Concerning caps on future discretionary spending, it appears the reporter or the truth-o-meter judges, or both, failed to distinguish a cut in spending from a limit on future spending increases. Also cited is the Stop Over Spending (SOS) bill, which I was told by the reporter with whom I met was the only thing the Isakson campaign cited in its defense. As I explained to the reporter, nothing in the SOS bill requires that any spending be substantially cut at all. I thoroughly provided reasoning therefore. I gave the reporter examples of things that would result in a substantial cut in spending, such as repeal of Medicare Part D. According to the Medicare Trustees, Medicare Part D had a present value liability figure in 2008 that exceeded 31 percent the net worth of all Americans combined as of the end of 2009. I encourage all readers to read the SOS bill (it can be found online). Also cited in favor of the senator is his vote against a spending increase relating to Iraq and Hurricane Katrina recovery efforts because it included $700 million in earmarks. Voting against a spending increase is not proposing, or voting in favor of, a cut (or a substantial cut) in spending. The only thing cited to cut spending was small proposed cut in Medicare and Medicaid that would reportedly have cut 2 percent from budget deficit forecasts over five years. The spending cuts were estimated to be $36 billion. The per-year average spending cut would be $7.2 billion (i.e. $36 billion divided by 5). Total federal spending for 2008 amounted to approximately $2,983 billion. I do not believe something that could cut spending by 0.2 percent (i.e. 7.2 divided by 2,983) could reasonably be considered to substantially cut spending. It is akin to a 2 cent saving on a good that would ordinarily cost $10. After publication, through email correspondence with the reporter, I was told the truth-o-meter judges felt the average person would consider the SOS and pay-go, etc. as significant efforts to cut spending. I replied by first noting that Senator Isakson consistently voted against pay-go when his party was in power. I also offered the following example that an ordinary reasonable person could understand: If an individual said his family spends $1,000 per week but plans to limit future spending increases, but the individual said no other actions would be taken regarding spending, no ordinary reasonable person would think that person had planned to cut his familys spending, let alone cut the spending substantially. Martindale-Hubbell is the organization that rates lawyers, and the rating is done by other lawyers. I have, and for many years have had, an AV rating from Martindale-Hubbell. An AV rating is the highest rating in terms of work quality and integrity (including honesty). Simply put, I tell the truth. In sum, Senator Isakson never proposed, nor voted in favor of, a substantial cut in spending. Thus, I told the truth. The GAO said in 2007: GAOs long-term simulations continue to show ever larger deficits resulting in a federal debt burden that ultimately spirals out of control. While I am very disheartened by the truth-o-meter article, what is really sad is that you have helped Mr. Isakson so he can continue fulfilling GAOs prophesy. Allen Buckley",0.6,0.4,0.7,0.6346707394

Hillary Clinton about her health care plan. Oh, no, Im not, said Clinton, who appeared on theThe OReilly Factoron April 30, 2008. Clinton boiled her plan down to this: Everybody who has health insurance whos happy with it, you keep it. No changes. But what I am going to do is take an already existing plan -- its not government-run, its not a new bureaucracy. Its the way Congress and federal employees get their health care. And were going to open it up to every American, because I think its about time... But youre going to subsidize it, OReilly interjected. Well, we are, Clinton said. But heres why. You already are subsidizing it. Your family policy has a $900 hidden tax. Why? Because when some poor person who doesnt have health insurance... ...goes to the emergency room...youve got to pick it up, OReilly said, finishing her sentence. The $900 figure is key to Clintons plan. Yes, she is saying, the government will subsidize her health care plan. But, the thinking goes, private insurance companies will charge lower premiums to their existing customers because they will no longer have to subsidize health care costs incurred by uninsured people. Think of it like this, said John Sheils, senior vice president of The Lewin Group, a non-partisan group that has analyzed health care plans for both Democrats and Republicans: Someone shoplifts a loaf of bread from the grocery story. The price of bread is inflated a bit for everyone else to offset the stores loss. Thats kind of whats going on with healthcare, Sheils said. Hospitals have to treat people who come in and need medical care. And if those people dont pay, its kind of like walking out of the story without paying for bread, he said. The cost is shifted onto those with private insurance. Sheils said Clintons claim that family health insurance policies subsidize the uninsured to the tune of about $900 a year is in the ballpark. Sheils believes the number is a little lower, closer to $800 per year. Hillary cites that same $900 figure in her formal health care proposal, the American Health Choices Plan. One cause of the crisis in the health care system is that rather than containing costs, the system shifts them: about half of all hospital losses are passed along to other payers, according to her plan. Rather than reducing prices, the system raises families costs. And, rather than covering all Americans, the system charges insured families a hidden tax: premiums are roughly $900 higher to pay for the cost of care for the uninsured. It cites a report from Families USA called Paying a Premium: The added cost of care for the uninsured. The report was based on an analysis of data by Kenneth E. Thorpe, former Clinton administration health expert, now a professor at Emory University. Thorpe says Clintons figure actually is low. According to his analysis, about $922 of a family policy was used to subsidize the uninsured in 2005. But the cost of health care has gone up since then, as have the number of uninsured. In 2008, the number is closer to $1,270, he said. The only way for hospitals to offset the costs (of the uninsured) is to have private insurers pay more than its worth, Thorpe said. It is their only means to stay financially solvent. In 2005, private health paid about 25% more than the cost of care in hospitals, Thorpe said, citing a Medicare Payment Advisory Commission report to Congress. OReilly didnt contest Clintons numbers, but he did take umbrage with subsidizing other peoples health care. I mean, I dont want to be paying for someone whos taking heroin and drinking a bottle of gin a day, OReilly said. But I assume you want to pay for some hardworking families whose kid has juvenile diabetes, Clinton said. Or some woman... that just gets diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis. I dont mind doing it, OReilly said. Clintons point was that, to an extent, family health policy holders already are shouldering some of the burden for the uninsured. There may be some debate about whether the number is exactly $900 a year, as she stated, but several health policy experts agreed that shes at least close. ",0.8,0.2,1,0.2933100564

Minutes into the 40-minute Florida Senate Showdown, Rubio made a case that he'll stand up to President Barack Obama's agenda and Crist won't.Everyone knows that you won't stand up to the Obama agenda because just a year ago you were campaigning for it, the former House speaker said, referring to Feb. 10, 2009, when Crist embraced the president at a Fort Myers campaign event for the federal stimulus package.We've fact-checked several claims about Crist's support for the stimulus. Indeed, he earned a Pants on Fire rating for saying he didn't endorse it. So it was a Rubio comment later in the program that drew our attention. FOX News Sunday host Chris Wallace asked Rubio, Why is $8 billion and 87,000 jobs bad for a state that has 12 percent unemployment?Well ... if it's bad for America, it can't possibly be good for your state, Rubio said. Let me tell you why the stimulus has failed. The stimulus has failed because since that famous day in February where the governor campaigned with Barack Obama on behalf of the stimulus program, 211,000 Floridians have lost their jobs.211,000 is a big number, so we wanted to check Rubio's facts.Conveniently, the state's Agency for Workforce Innovation released a report on state employment figures just two days before the debate. In it, Florida's record 12.2 percent unemployment rate is announced, along with many statistics on the state's jobs picture, including year-over-year numbers from February 2009, the month Crist campaigned with Obama. The report shows Florida had 8,356,000 jobs in February 2009 and 8,125,000 in February 2010, the difference being 231,000. These are the seasonally adjusted numbers for the civilian population.However, if you look at seasonally adjusted nonagricultural employment --- a less-inclusive number --- you see the basis for Rubio's claim. There the job loss in a year's time is 211,500.It's the latter number that the Rubio campaign points to. Spokesman Alberto Martinez also shared a report from House Way and Means Republicans that seeks to highlight the stimulus as a job-killer, rather than a job creator, where Florida is said to have lost 240,400 jobs since the stimulus passed.Like any statistics, these are easily sliced and diced to make the key point. But Rubio is very close to the precise number, and in fact, he underestimates it slightly when his point is that Florida has lost a lot of jobs. So we rule this one True.",1,0,1,0.3497333444

John McCain as prescient on the financial crisis, McCain's campaign unveiled anew advertisementsaying he had spotted problems with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac two years ago. John McCain fought to rein in Fannie and Freddie ... but Democrats blocked the reforms, McCain's new ad says. As evidence, the ad points to McCain's support of a bill in 2006 to strengthen oversight of Fannie and Freddie, and Democrats' opposition to that bill.Those points merit caveats, but first, some context. Fannie and Freddie, private corporations created and sponsored by Congress to lower the cost of mortgage capital, quintupled in size between 1995 and 2004, as they pioneered the practice of selling bundled mortgages in the form of securities. Federal officials in both the Bill Clinton and George W. Bush administrations sought greater authority to regulate them, but were largely stymied by Congress. In early September 2008, with home values plummeting,the government seized control of Fannie and Freddie to prevent them from failing, a move that could cost U.S. taxpayers tens of billions of dollars. McCain has taken heat for recent revelations that Freddie Mac paid a lobbying firm co-owned by his campaign manager, Rick Davis, $15,000 a month from 2005 through August 2008. But the campaign has called attention — in advertisements like this one — to McCain's support for tighter oversight of the companies. McCain did indeed co-sponsor the Federal Housing Enterprise Regulatory Reform Act of 2005, a bill that would have enhanced oversight of Freddie and Fannie. Sen. Chuck Hagel, R-Neb.,introduced the bill in January 2005 and immediately garnered co-sponsorship from two other Republican senators. McCain signed on in May 2006 after a damning federal report on accounting practices at Fannie Mae was released. If Congress does not act, American taxpayers will continue to be exposed to the enormous risk that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac pose to the housing market, the overall financial system, and the economy as a whole, he said ina statement. The National Association of Home Builders opposed the bill, as did the National Association of Realtors. Senate Democrats said they supported some form of stricter oversight, but would not support a provision of Hagel's bill that would limit the size of the company's portfolios. Negotiations stalled and the bill never made it to the floor. Does McCain's support for that bill amount to fighting to rein in Freddie and Fannie? Sort of. Others had been fighting for Fannie-and-Freddie reform for more than a decade, and McCain signed ontothe bill a year-and-a-half after it was introduced. And hereportedlydidn't do too much for the bill beyond co-sponsoring it and issuing a statement. The McCain campaign has also noted that in 2003 he was one of five Republican senators to co-sponsor a prior bill to tighten oversight of Fannie and Freddie. Still, if he fought for reform, it wasn't exactly guns-a-blazin'. Did Democrats block the reforms? More or less. They preferred a pared-down bill, and so did not support Hagel's. McCain overstates his role in pushing for Fannie and Freddie reform, and slightly oversimplifies the dynamic at work in the Senate. We give hisclaim a Half True.",0.7,0.3,0.9,0.6842144725

Tom Wolf for keeping parts of Pennsylvania closed that the president thinks are no longer threatened by the coronavirus. You have areas of Pennsylvania that are barely affected and the governor wants to keep them closed, Trump told a crowd of workers from Owens & Minor, a company that manufactures and distributes masks, gloves and gowns to health care workers, on May 14. We wondered whether the statewide stay-at-home order Wolf issued on April 1 still applies to places hardly impacted by the deadly disease. It all depends what criteria are used to determine whether the coronavirus still poses a threat. The virus is still raging across Southeastern Pennsylvania, and not even Trump is arguing that Philadelphia and its suburbs are ready to reopen. Officials in Delaware and Bucks counties, however, have asked Wolf to exclude their nursing-home populations when he eventually rates their readiness. Largely when you look across the state, the hardest hit area has been the Southeast of Pennsylvania, said Dr. David Rubin, director of PolicyLab at Childrens Hospital of Philadelphia, which has been tracking the differences in the outbreak across individual regions of the country. The Philadelphia area as far west as Lancaster, Berks and Dauphin counties, and north to the Lehigh Valley have seen some of the worst outbreaks in Pennsylvania, he said. Largely the rest of the state has had a pretty deceptively, sort of minimal experience with COVID, Rubin said. That includes Allegheny County, the rural T and the South, Central and Southwestern parts of the state. When you have someone in that area of the state that are upset that they are unable to work, theyre not wrong, Rubin said. But for those in the Southeast worried about a resurgence, theyre not wrong, either. Wolf has already moved 37 Pennsylvania counties into what he calls the yellow phase of reopening. In these places, many businesses may resume in-person operations, and residents may leave their homes so long as they take precautions. Thirteen counties in Southwestern Pennsylvania moved into the yellow phase May 15. Twenty-four others in the Northern half of the state entered yellow May 8. Another 12 counties will move into yellow on May 22. Counties in the red phase of Wolfs reopening plan are still under lockdown, with stay-at-home orders in place and all but essential businesses closed. Counties that eventually make it to the green phase will ask businesses and individuals to follow Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and State Department of Health guidelines for limiting the spread of the virus but will otherwise have no restrictions. Yellow counties gyms, hair salons, and schools must remain closed, and gatherings of more than 25 people are prohibited. Even still, yellow is the distinction several other Central and Eastern Pennsylvania counties are clamoring for. A key factor that determines whether a county qualifies for yellow privileges is whether it has fewer than 50 new reported coronavirus cases per 100,000 residents over a period of 14 days. The number of people sickened with the virus in Lancaster, Lebanon, Dauphin, Franklin and Schuylkill counties disqualifies them from entering the yellow phase. But that fact didnt stop local leaders from announcing plans to reopen businesses anyway – with or without Wolfs blessing. In a series of letters and tweets, the officials, including state lawmakers and county commissioners, begged Wolf to allow local businesses to reopen and better position themselves to survive the crisis. Officials from Dauphin, Franklin and Schuylkill counties later backed down. Lebanon officials are set to vote on reopening today. Lancaster officials held a news conference on the issue Thursday night but did not say what they will do. Counties reversed course after Wolf called them cowardly and selfish and threatened to withhold their federal stimulus funds if they directed businesses and residents to defy his order. Until recently, another nine counties found themselves in limbo. They had reported fewer than 50 cases per 100,000 residents over a 14-day period, but until May 15, when Wolf announced plans to move them into the yellow phase soon, they remained stuck in the red zone, which requires businesses to stay closed and residents to continue sheltering at home. Those counties include: York, Adams, Perry, Juniata, Mifflin, Carbon, Wyoming, Susquehanna and Wayne. Officials from York and Adams counties had been especially vocal about their frustration that businesses had not been cleared to reopen. Some officials said they didnt understand what was holding them back, given their success keeping coronavirus case counts relatively low. Wolf had been asked about the discrepancy several times in recent days before he announced plans to move the counties into yellow by May 22, and his explanations lacked clarity. We had to read a 7,000 word Wolf administration document titled Process to Reopen Pennsylvania to figure it out. A countys coronavirus case count is not the only piece of information Wolfs team uses to determine when its ready to move into the yellow phase. Hes said this publicly, but on recent calls with the press, he hasnt listed the other factors that matter. Carnegie Mellon University researchers advising the state compiled the list and rated counties in each category. According to the document, the other factors are: A countys ability to meet a surge in demand for intensive care. A countys density. The share of county residents who are over age 60. The share of county residents who work in physically closed industry sectors, such as nursing homes. When those pieces are considered, it appears York County was held back from reopening because of its population density, and Adams County was ordered to stay closed because it has an insufficient number of intensive care unit beds. Mifflin, Juniata, Perry, Carbon, Susquehanna and Wayne counties were also flagged because of limited ICU capacity. We had to click through a link tucked at the bottom of a May 8 press release to find a May 7 PowerPoint presentation detailing how each Pennsylvania county rates on the Carnegie Mellon risk assessment scale. Its unclear if county officials calling to have their stay-at-home orders lifted know where to find their own ratings. Wyoming County in the Northeast corner of the state has a small number of coronavirus cases and doesnt rate as high risk in any of the other categories. Before Wolf announced that Wyoming County would move into the yellow phase by May 22, it was unclear why Wolf wouldnt allow businesses there to reopen. County officials had announced plans to reopen without Wolfs approval and later backed down. In the Process to Reopen Pennsylvania document, the state cautioned that the reopening process will be fluid and that the Carnegie Mellon rating system is not designed to make decisions but rather to inform decision makers. Trump said that Wolf wants to keep parts of Pennsylvania closed that have been barely affected by the coronavirus. Trump was likely speaking about counties in Central and Eastern Pennsylvania like Lebanon and Lancaster whose Republican lawmakers have been clamoring for more freedom even though their coronavirus case counts remain relatively high. Those places have not been barely affected. Theyre battling active outbreaks. Trump was right, though, that until May 15, Wolf wanted to keep closed nine counties with relatively few cases.",0.7,0.4,1,0.9803134889

False Confidence (between 0 and 1): 0.05",Says the state budget includes spending on commercials for Fortune 500 companies.,"State Rep. David Simpson says the state budget lawmakers sent to Gov. Rick Perry spends money in the wrong places — such as on Walmart commercials.Despite conservative boasts of cost cutting, not raising taxes and not using the Economic Stabilization Fund, or rainy day fund, the budget still preserves about $500 million of pork for special interests including film and music makers, video games and commercials for Fortune 500 companies, the Longview Republican said in a June 5 op-ed in the Longview News-Journal.Its well-reported that the state promotes music, film and even video games. But this is the first weve heard about funding TV spots for the top 500 U.S. companies that Fortune magazine ranks by revenue every year.To back up the statement, Simpson aide Michael Bullock noted that the 2012-13 budget the House approved on May 28 appropriates $32 million for film and music marketing, a program overseen by the governors office. The budget provides $16 million each year to market Texas as a film location and promote the Texas music industry, according to the May 26 House-Senate conference committee report.What does that have to do with Fortune 500 TV spots?Bullock pointed us to a March report by the Texas state comptroller analyzing the states economic development incentives for 2010. According to the report, lawmakers in 2007 revised the Film Industry Incentive Program, created in 2005, so its grants could be extended to companies working in the entire moving image industry, sweeping in makers of commercials, TV programs and video games.In 2009, the Legislature appropriated $64 million in incentives for the biennium.According to the report, from April 2009 through August 2010, the Texas Film Commission approved 152 applications to help fund the production of commercials, awarding $2 million to grantees who, all told, said theyd spend $37.4 million in Texas.And did any of the commercials promote Fortune 500 companies? The report lists a handful.As of Aug. 31, the company Action Figure No. 1. Inc., had received more than $8,000 for an AT&T television commercial, which was one of three commercials made for AT&T, a Fortune 500 company, by three different companies using state grants totaling about $25,600, the report says. Also, the company Radical Media received $32,000 in grant money to make a commercial for Walmart, another Fortune 500 company, and the company Modern Times received $11,133 to make a commercial for the TV show Friday Night Lights. That show aired on NBC, a network owned by the Fortune 500 company General Electric.We wondered if each Fortune 500 company benefits from grants going to separate production companies. Perry spokeswoman Lucy Nashed told us the grants can go to either the production company, advertising agency or the client — such as a Fortune 500 company — involved in a supported TV ad. Lastly, we turned to the Texas Film Commission, which says on its website that certain commercials — such as ads for state agencies or those that portray Texas negatively — arent eligible for incentives.Otherwise, state law permits incentives for a TV commercial project of up to 5 percent of the amount spent on the project in the state, according to the commission. To qualify, the maker must spend at least $100,000 in Texas, at least 60 percent of its shooting days must be completed in the state and at least 70 percent of the paid crew, cast and extras must be Texas residents.Nashed told us TV commercial projects will continue to be eligible for incentives in 2012-13.",0.9,0.1,0.8,0.6358986682

Such is the case for a decade-old email chain that warns against giving children a combination of Motrin and Robitussin, because they may have a heart attack. One example of the claim, which has been popping up in email inboxes since at least 2008, has gotten over 115,000 shares on Facebook and says that an 8-year-old girl named Madison passed away after she was allegedly given both medications: This was sent to us from a nurse in our district  thought Id pass along just as an FYI. Motrin and Robitussin dont mix!!! Madison, age 8, passed away just a few days ago. Weve been asked to pass this on. Doctors told her family that there have been quite a few children Madisons age that have died recently the same way that she did. The only common link between them was that they were given Motrin (ibuprofen) and Robitussin together, this caused a heart attack. They believe this is what happened to them. They told her to alert everyone to this. Do not give children both of these medicines together. You can give them one or the other but not both. When Madison collapsed she suffered a heart attack and they were able to revive her but the loss of oxygen damaged her brain and she was put on the respirator. After this she had four strokes before she died after being taken off the respirator. Please pass this on !!!!!!!!! The bottom of the post has the email signature: Lisa Lopez M.A. Childrens Medical Center of Dallas Pulmonary Clinic. The post was flagged as part of Facebooks efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) This rumor is just that –– a rumor. There is no evidence to suggest that a Motrin-Robitussin combination causes heart attacks in otherwise healthy children. The Childrens Medical Center in Dallas, Texas, that appeared in the email signature came out to dispel the rumor in 2010, roughly a year after it started being shared. The hospitals announcement said the following: In 2009, a Childrens employee received the e-mail from a friend and inadvertently forwarded it from a work account. Because the employees professional signature was included at the bottom of the e-mail, the information appeared to come from a reliable source at Childrens Medical Center. This is not the case. All medications have side effects, the hospital noted, and parents of children with underlying medical conditions must always be vigilant about the medications their child is taking. The hospital statement advised parents to consult with their childrens doctor or a pharmacist before mixing any over-the-counter drugs. The Childrens Medical Center also addressed the rumor in a tweet on Dec. 22, 2014: Facebook post about Motrin & Robitussin is not correct & was not posted by one of our employees. The tweet linked to a 2009 fact-check by Snopes on the topic. Its important to note that the Food and Drug Administration does not recommend children under the age of two be given cough-cold medications. But the agency has not issued any warnings that the ingredients in Motrin (which contains ibuprofen) or Robitussin (which contains dextromethorphan and/or pseudoephedrine or sometimes chlorpheniramine) could cause heart attacks in children when combined. These ingredients are also in many other medications on the market, yet the chain email only singles out Motrin and Robitussin. If the danger of heart attacks, strokes or death was prevalent in the combination of two commonly used medications, health officials would have issued widespread public health warnings. Motrin alone is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug, and according to the FDA, the labels of over-the-counter versions warn that for adults and children (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs), except aspirin, increase the risk of heart attack, heart failure, and stroke. These can be fatal. The risk is higher if you use more than directed or for longer than directed. Ashley Turney, an FDA spokesperson for over-the-counter drugs, told PolitiFact that use of Robitussin products, with or without Motrin, is not associated with heart attacks. She described Robitussin as an umbrella brand containing a series of childrens cough and cold products that may contain a single ingredient or combinations of dextromethorphan hydrobromide, guaifenesin, phenylephrine hydrochloride, or chlorpheniramine maleate. The recommended use, dosing, and warnings vary amongst the seven Robitussin products that are intended for use in children over 4 or 6 years, she said. Turney noted that its important for people to read the drug facts label directions for all over-the-counter medications. An old rumor claims combining Motrin and Robitussin can cause heart attacks in children. There is no evidence that giving both of these medications to children causes heart attacks. Children who are too young or have underlying medical conditions can experience adverse side effects from taking any combination of over-the-counter medicine, health officials say. Parents are recommended to talk with their childs health care provider, or a pharmacist, if they have any questions about mixing medications. This rumor is False.",0,1,1,0.9282229197

Bushs White House also used private email, pundit Juan Williams asked on Fox News Sunday. The shows March 15, 2015, pundit panel debated the importance of the ongoing controversy regarding Clintons decision to exclusively use a private email account, rather than a .gov account, during her time as secretary of state. In doing so, experts say she was able to circumvent transparency and records preservation standards. Williams turned to his fellow commentator, Republican strategist and former Bush adviser Karl Rove, arguing that the email scandal during the Bush administration didnt garner the same level of media criticism. Thus, the attention on Clinton is unwarranted. When Karl was in trouble back in 07, (there was) no press coverage, just about zero press coverage of this issue, Williams said, noting that he found just one Washington Post editorial criticizing the private email use. Juan, you are in a different reality, and I wish that I was there with you, Rove said. We decided to look back and see what press coverage of the Bush administration email controversy looked like at the timeand how it compares to coverage of Clinton. The Bush email story First, a quick refresher about what happened in the Bush administration. In March 2007, eyes were on then-Attorney General Alberto Gonzales after the administration unexpectedly fired eight U.S.attorneys. Congress (recently taken over by Democrats) investigated the firings, alleging that the administration had dropped the prosecutors for political reasons. Over the course of the investigation, it came out that some White House officials had conducted White House business over private email accountsset up on a server through the Republican National Committee. The White House later admitted that some internal White House emails conducted on the RNC server might have been lost. Democrats in Congress accused the administration of purposefully circumventing recordkeeping processes, while the White House said staffers were supposed to use the RNC emails solely for political affairs, not official business. Comparing the Bush and Clinton email scandals is not exactly apples to apples, but there are some similarities. We looked back at media coverage at the time, and Williams has a point that it didnt cause the same level of hubbub as the Clinton email scandal. Though to say there was zero press coverage is an exaggeration -- even allowing for a bit of hyperbole. Comparing the coverage We did a search through Lexis-Nexis, a research service that tracks news articles and transcripts, between March and May 2007. We found more than 125 transcripts from the major cable networks and National Public Radio that include Republican National Committee and email within 10 words of each other. The Lexis-Nexis search also yielded more than 200 related newspaper articles across the country within the same time frame. Lets compare that to coverage of the Clinton controversy. Since the story broke March 3, 2015 -- two weeks ago -- we found 204 cable and public radio transcripts that include Clinton and email. We also found 1,700 newspaper articles across the country. Thats several times as many articles and transcripts about Clinton than there were about the Bush email controversy in a quarter of the time. Its a rough measurement, but clearly there has been more media attention on Clintons use of private email than that of the White House staffers. What about Williams reference to the singular Washington Post editorial criticizing the private email use among White House staffers? We found the one editorial, as well as a couple opinion columns. In comparison, the Washington Post has so far written two editorials regarding Clintons private email use. Not the same Williams argument is that Republicans are stoking the media fire of the Clinton email scandal because theyre worried about Clintons 2016 potential, compared to Republican candidates. Theres some nuances and contextual factors that might explain the difference in media coverage. First of all, theres the difference in whos at the receiving end of the criticisms. In 2007, it was a group of higher-up White House staffers and advisers (notably Rove) who occasionally used private email accounts for official business. As far as we can tell, though, Bush himself was not suspected as being part of this group. Today, the target is a former secretary of state, who only used private email when conducting official government business. Whats more is that Clinton is in all likelihood running for president in 2016, so she has a lot of media attention on her to begin with. At the time of their email controversy, the Bush administration was past their 2004 second-term election and the 2006 midterms. Additionally, the White House email controversy was on the periphery of a much larger scandal -- the firings of the eight U.S. attorneys. We searched Lexis-Nexis for articles about Attorney General Gonzales in the same time frame that we used to explore coverage of the White House email controversy. The search came up with more than 6,000 combined newspaper articles and transcripts. (Compared to the more than 325 about the emails). As oneWashington Post article put it: The controversy over the outside e-mail accounts is a byproduct of the ongoing showdown over the prosecutor firings. Our ruling Williams said there was just about zero press coverage of the 2007 Bush White House email controversy. We emailed Williams and did not hear back. Saying there was zero press coverage is an exaggeration --even allowing for a bit of hyperbole. We found hundreds of articles and television transcripts referencing the issue. Still, Williams has something of a point that compared to the extensive recent coverage of Clintons use of private email, media coverage of the 2007 Bush White House email controversy was thin. Williams statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.",0.3,0.7,1,0.6377831914

Sheehan said in a national television interview that its not a crime for immigrants to live in the U.S. without documentation. Sheehan, a Democrat, was defending her citys status as a so-called sanctuary cityto Fox News host Tucker Carlson. The city's law enforcement officials donot report undocumented immigrants to federal authorities unless they commit a serious crime. Simply being in this country without documentation is not a crime,Sheehan said. The U.S. Supreme Court has said that. Carlson was left baffled. You just said that being here illegally is not illegal? Im not aware of that Supreme Court decision, Carlson said. How is that true? Sheehan cited a court ruling. In Arizona v. the United States, the Supreme Court said simply being here undocumented is not a crime, she said. There are civil violations and then there are criminal violations. So, whos right? Sheehan or Carlson? Whats Sheehan talking about? The Supreme Court case Sheehan cited involved a 2010 challenge to an Arizona immigration law from the Obama administration. The law required that immigrants carry documents proving their status in Arizona. Police were also instructed to stop and seek documents from anyone they suspected of being undocumented. Those without documents faced a state criminal charge. The Obama administration contended Arizona could not create a state level criminal charge for the violation because its already regulated by Congress. The Supreme Court agreed with the Obama administration and struck down that section of the Arizona law, among other parts. Civil or criminal Experts supported Sheehans claim by pointing out how the U.S. legal system works. People who break the law in the U.S. have committed either a criminal or civil violation depending on how the law defines it and how prosecutors choose to proceed. Being in the U.S. without documentation is considered a civil matter, said Nancy Morawetz, professor of clinical law at New York University School of Law. Being present in the U.S., that status, is not a crime, Morawetz said. That doesnt mean undocumented immigrants can live in the U.S. without consequence, said Rick Su, a professor at the University at Buffalo School of Law. Federal authorities can deport them. A criminal violation comes with a punishment, like time in prison. Civil cases come with penalties instead. Deportation is considered a penalty under federal law, not a punishment. Congress can decide what they want to make a crime and what they want to make a civil violation, Su said. What theyve decided is that immigration violations by themselves are civil violations. The Supreme Court confirmed that decision in Arizona v. United States. What the Supreme Court said in Arizona v. U.S. is that generally being unlawfully present in the U.S. is not a crime, and thats definitely true, Su said. What the court did, is say Congress had made these civil violations and Arizona is trying to make them criminal violations. Why a civil matter? Its easier to deport undocumented immigrants through civil proceedings, Su said. In deportation proceedings, immigrants face a special immigrant judge. The government does not have to provide a public attorney to immigrants who cannot afford one in these cases. The burden is then entirely on the immigrant to show they are in the country lawfully. They are also not entitled to any kind of due process. There are some immigration laws that can land an immigrant in criminal court. Entering the U.S. illegally is a crime, for example, but staying after a temporary visa has expired is a civil violation. As much as two-thirds of undocumented immigrants in the U.S. entered legally with a visa,according to the Center for Migration Studies. Our ruling Sheehan said simply being in this country without documentation is not a crime. It may be semantics, but Sheehan is right. Living in the U.S. without documentation is a civil violation, not a crime. PolitiFact Floridarated a similar claim Mostly True earlier this year. As its fact check noted, however, those in the U.S. without documentation may have committed a crime by entering the country illegally. Mark Krikorian, executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies, a group that generally opposes loosening immigration laws, told PolitiFact Florida that it's easy for such individuals to run into separate criminal problems even beyond their method of entry, such as filling out an employment eligibility form to get a job when they arent eligible to work. But their illegal presence is not a crime. Sheehan's statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information.",1,0,1,0.4790480281

False Confidence (between 0 and 1): 0.3",President Barack Obama said at the beginning of the negotiations that the basic approach was to dismantle Irans nuclear program in exchange for dismantling the sanctions.,"In the wake of the newly completed Iran nuclear agreement, a number of Republicans have charged that the Obama administration has struck a deal that they see as dangerous and inadequate. Among them is freshman Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., a frequent critic of Obamas foreign policy. In an appearance on CNN on July 15, Cotton lamented what he saw as a weak agreement: He (Obama) said at the beginning of the negotiations that the basic approach was to dismantle Iran's nuclear program in exchange for dismantling the sanctions. In fact, we are going to keep Iran's nuclear program in place. In fact, Western countries are going to help Iran develop advanced capabilities. We decided to check the claim that the administrations original intent was to dismantle Irans nuclear program in exchange for dismantling the sanctions. Which nuclear program? Since Iran has long asserted that it has a right to pursue nuclear energy -- as distinct from nuclear weapons -- a key question for us was whether the term nuclear program referred narrowly to nuclear weapons or more broadly to any kind of nuclear research, including nuclear energy. Its easy to see how a speaker could say nuclear program when they actually intended to say nuclear weapons program. The answer, according to Cottons staff, is that the senator was referring to the nuclear program as a whole, not simply the weapons program. Cottons staff also pointed PolitiFact to some quotes from Obamas 2012 presidential debate against Mitt Romney to back up their claim. In the debate, Obama boasted of the success of sanctions in paving a way forward for negotiations: The work that weve done with respect to sanctions now offers Iran a choice. They can take the diplomatic route and end their nuclear program or they will have to face a united world and a United States president, me, who said were not going to take any options off the table, he said. He alluded to Iran either giving up or ending their nuclear program — he didnt specify that he was referring to the Iranian nuclear weapons program — two more times during the debate. However, this wouldnt have been, as Cotton said, at the beginning of negotiations -- the first meeting between Secretary of State John Kerry and his Iranian counterparts was held on Sept. 26, 2013. (Here's a detailed timeline.) So we decided to see if we could find some stronger evidence. As it happens, a pro-Israel group, the Israel Project, also made a statement much like Cottons, and a spokeswoman pointed us to several pieces of evidence.  One is a remark by Kerry before the House Foreign Affairs Committee on Dec. 10, 2013, right around the time negotiations were kicking into gear. But I dont think that any of us thought we were just imposing these sanctions for the sake of imposing them. We did it because we knew that it would hopefully help Iran dismantle its nuclear program. That was the whole point of the regime. Upon examining the full context of Kerrys speech, however, it becomes clear that Kerry was not referring to the strategy of the White House, but rather to his own time in the Senate, and he seems to reflect the mind-set he and his fellow senators had toward sanctions. I will tell you that in my 29 years, just about shy of the full 29 Ive served in the Senate, I was always a leading proponent of the sanctions against Iran. Im proud of what we did here. But it was undeniable that the pressure we put on Iran through these sanctions is exactly what has brought Iran to the table today, and I think Congress deserves an enormous amount of credit for that, said Kerry. Only then does he add, But I dont think that any of us thought we were just imposing these sanctions for the sake of imposing them. We did it because we knew that it would hopefully help Iran dismantle its nuclear program. That was the whole point of the regime. The Israel Project also pointed us to a comment by Wendy Sherman, the under secretary of state for political affairs, during a PBS interview on Dec. 4, 2013. Asked whether a comprehensive agreement will include dismantling, full dismantling, Sherman replied, This includes a lot of dismantling of their infrastructure  At the end of the day, what is critical here is that the international community and the United States of America must have full confidence that Iran truly has a peaceful program. But Shermans statement refers to a lot of dismantling, which is short of a full dismantling. Contrary evidence Perhaps the most definitive refutation of Cottons claim comes from Obama himself, in an appearance on Dec. 7, 2013, at a Middle East policy forum -- again, right around when the negotiations were starting. If we could create an option in which Iran eliminated every single nut and bolt of their nuclear program and forswore the possibility of ever having a nuclear program, and for that matter got rid of all its military capabilities, I would take it. But I want to make sure everybody understands it — that particular option is not available. So as a consequence, what we have to do is make a decision as to, given the options available, what is the best way for us to (ensure) Iran does not get a nuclear weapon? This suggests that the Obama administration was focused not on completely eliminating the Iranian nuclear program, but rather on blocking the pathway to a nuclear weapon. It has not been the goal of the George W. Bush administration or the Obama administration to completely dismantle every aspect of their nuclear program, said Daryl Kimball, executive director of the Arms Control Association, a group that aims to educate the public on arms control policy. He added, Look at the context — (the U.S.) goal is to dismantle, curtail, reduce, to the point (Iran) cannot acquire a nuclear weapon. Nobody is arguing about completely eliminating the nuclear program. The time element of Cottons claim is one of its most problematic features. If Cotton had been referring to statements Obama made before he was president, he would have had a better argument, experts say. Theres a difference between what the president has said about the nuclear program while he was in the process of trying to get elected and comments that he has made when trying to garner support in Congress and then today, when trying to explain what he has, said Richard Brennan, a political scientist at the Rand Corp. Brennan pointed us to a March 2007 speech Obama made in Chicago to the American-Israel Public Affairs Committee, a pro-Israel group. In his remarks, Obama said, The world must work to stop Irans uranium enrichment program and prevent Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons. Uranium enrichment is a key component of any nuclear program, not simply a nuclear weapons program, so this could be interpreted as Obama talking about more than simply preventing Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon. On balance, Brennan agreed with other experts we checked with that, on its face, Cottons statement was probably not accurate. By the time negotiations seriously began in late 2013, the administration had changed its position to ensuring primarily that Iran did not have a nuclear weapon. Our ruling Cotton said that Obama said at the beginning of the negotiations that the basic approach was to dismantle Irans nuclear program in exchange for dismantling the sanctions. In 2007 or even as late as 2012, that might have been true, though believing so requires some careful parsing of the words and intentions of Obama and his advisers. Still, by late 2013 -- the negotiation period Cotton specifically referred to -- the administration had settled on a strategy of blocking a pathway to a nuclear weapon, rather than eliminating any trace of nuclear activities in Iran, including energy. On Dec. 7, 2013, Obama himself explicitly repudiated the idea that it would be possible to fully dismantle every single nut and bolt of their nuclear program.",0.6,0.4,0.9,0.3238933001

But according to one claim on Facebook, the war is fake. The Feb. 25 post showed a photo of the Joker from the Batman film, The Dark Knight', with text overlaid that read, Them: Lets pray for Ukraine! Me: Its all scripted and staged. The accompanying text post read, Russia and Ukraine is a coverup! and linked to a nine-minute YouTube video that falsely claimed the war is a coverup to distract from COVID-19, which it says was also planned and staged. The post was flagged as part of Facebooks efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) First off, COVID-19 is real. PolitiFact named claims to the contrary its 2020 Lie of the Year. Statistical data, hospitals, medical workers, news reports and more show that the pandemic is authentic, and has caused millions to get sick or die. As for war in Ukraine, daily evidence proves that there is indeed a war. During the early morning of Feb. 24, after months of increased Russian military presence near the Ukrainian border, President Vladimir Putin announced the invasion into Ukraine in a televised speech, calling it a special military operation. Following Russian missile strikes on Feb. 24, 2022, a destroyed car, damaged radar and equipment are shown at a Ukrainian military facility outside Mariupol, Ukraine. (AP Photo) Before the Russian invasion, numerous Ukrainian civilians volunteered to become fighters and took part in military training. Now, theyre on the frontline. NPR, The New York Times and other news sources have extensively covered the situation in Ukraine, where journalists and citizens have transmitted images depicting the war effort. This picture, my God. https://t.co/8m2EDk8cBb pic.twitter.com/YW8dZ2fI04 The exact number of civilians killed is unknown, but as of March 2, Ukraines State Emergency Service estimated more than 2,000 Ukrainians dead, according to CNN. On March 4, the United Nations gave a lower count of 331 people killed, including 19 children, and 675 who were injured. But the real toll is likely to be much higher, Liz Throssell, U.N. spokesperson, said. The U.N. reported that most civilian deaths in the first eight days of conflict were caused by the use of explosive weapons with a wide impact area, including shelling from heavy artillery and multi-launch rocket systems, and missile and air strikes. Russia has also reported casualties. The Russian Defense Ministry announced that 498 Russian troops have died and 1,597 more have been injured, NPR reported. With the impact of the war on civilians being publicly reported, and both sides reporting troops deaths and injuries, the claim that any of this is being staged proves to be baseless. Even more evidence that the conflict is real: the swift response from other countries. NATO has stated they will not engage in the war, but have taken other means of action against Russia. The United States, the European Union and the United Kingdom have joined together in implementing harsh economic sanctions against the Russian economy. During his State of the Union Address on March 1, President Joe Biden announced that, in addition to cutting off Russia's largest banks from the international banking system, the U.S. will join our allies in closing off American air space to all Russian flights – further isolating Russia – and adding an additional squeeze on their economy. The value of the ruble, Russias currency, has fallen to less than one U.S. cent. Rising prices on some products like electronics and appliances have caused citizens to stock up, and NPR reports that arrests of anti-war protesters in Russia are racking up. They cite a Russian human rights group called OVD-Info, whove counted more than 8,000 arrests. Wealthy elites, who also face sanctions, have criticized Putins invasion of Ukraine. Scott Radnitz, an associate professor of Russian and Eurasian studies at the University of Washington, viewed the Facebook post and video, and said that the claim hinges on a world domination conspiracy theory — but there is no evidence presented for why or how the war is being staged. There is little to refute directly, other than to note that thousands or millions of people would have to be in on any conspiracy to fake a war, and like the 9/11 attacks (which some people also deny) there is substantial video footage of attacks on Ukrainian cities, Russian invading forces, and throngs of refugees, Radnitz said. Nevertheless, he added, a true believer will persist in denying all that evidence, something that is easier to do when the conflict is geographically distant and they do not personally know anyone directly affected by it. With a war raging, the world responding and both sides of the conflict experiencing its effects, the claim that the Russian invasion of Ukraine is scripted and staged holds no merit",0,1,0.3,0.1664550104

False Confidence (between 0 and 1): 0.3",At UNC 14% of students tested positive.,"The University of North Carolina made national news after reporting a coronavirus outbreak shortly after students returned to campus. Before students could even get their first assignments, university administrators abandoned their plans to hold in-person classes. The football team, however, is still scheduled to move forward with a modified Atlantic Coast Conference schedule. That upset U.S. Sen. Chris Murphy, a Democrat from Connecticut. The University of Connecticut was the first major football program to cancel its season due to the pandemic. Notre Dame and UNC are sending kids home because of COVID outbreaks (at UNC 14% of students tested positive), Murphy tweeted on Aug. 18, adding: But...not football players! They need to stay no matter the risk, because the college football money machine needs to keep churning. His tweet linked to a New York Times story about the situation at UNC. Murphy was clearly trying to make a point about college athletes being exploited. While doing so, however, he failed to provide the full context of UNCs outbreak. Is it true that 14% of students tested positive, as Murphy said? Not exactly. The percentage Murphy quoted is generally accurate. Its what the percentage represents that he didnt properly convey. Murphys tweet could give the impression that 14% of all students tested positive. That would mean that more than 2,670 of UNCs 19,117 undergraduate students have COVID-19. But thats not the case. While some schools (including Duke University) required students to be tested before entering campus, UNC didnt. UNC encourages students to be tested if they believe they have been exposed to the virus. In the week from Aug. 10 to 16, 954 students were tested. Of those, 130 — or 13.6% — tested positive. The university updates its testing numbers weekly on its online dashboard. Is it fair to say that the weeks infection rate for those who were tested accurately reflects the entire UNC student population? No. Because UNC is only testing people who think they need it, the results are likely to skewed, said Donald Taylor, director of the Social Science Research Institute at Duke University. UNC is doing symptomatic testing when folks are feeling sick, and contact tracing testing when you ask a person newly infected to say who they have been in close contact with, and then those folks are tested, Taylor said. People who feel sick, or who were in close contact with those who are positive would be expected to have a much higher rate of positivity than would an entire population, Taylor said. If it was a random sample of students, you could extrapolate, but would need to say it is a rough estimate, said Peter Ubel, a physician and behavioral scientist at the Duke Universitys Fuqua School of Business. If they tested symptomatic students, or ones with known exposures, then that suggests the 14% figure is higher than probably seen across the student body, Ubel said. UNC spokespersons emailed PolitiFact to reiterate that the 14% positivity rate does not reflect all students. It represents only students who took a COVID-19 test and had a positive result for coronavirus that week. As for Murphy, his office doesnt believe the tweet is misleading at all. Senator Murphy didnt say it was 14% of all students, Murphy spokesperson Jamie Geller said. He said it was 14%, with no qualifier, which logically infers that its of those who are tested. But in case there was any confusion, he linked to the article. We disagree with the notion that Murphys tweet clearly refers only to students who were tested. Murphy tweeted that at UNC 14% of students tested positive. Someone who reads Murphys tweet could understand that hes referring to the small sample of students who were tested. But, on its face, the tweet could give the impression that more than 2,600 students contracted COVID-19. Thats not the case. It would have been more accurate to tweet that 14% of tests were positive, rather than students. The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.",0.7,0.4,1,0.9144152562

False Confidence (between 0 and 1): 0.35",Georgia can substantially increase its funding for education by going after $2.5 billion in uncollected taxes.,"Education eats up the largest share of the state budget, so it only makes sense that its consuming much of the debate in the neck-and-neck governors race. Nathan Deal, the Republican incumbent, says his efforts to grow jobs and the economy have paid off for schools. Hs education track record also includes work for passage of a 2012 charter school amendment and a bipartisan deal to shore up the lottery-funded HOPE scholarship and pre-K programs. His challenger, Democratic state Sen. Jason Carter of Atlanta, contends that Deal has shortchanged Georgias children. Hes most critical of $1-billion-a-year-plus austerity cuts to education recommended by Deal in the first three of his four state budgets. Carter, who voted for those three budgets, is promising that, if hes elected, he will increase education spending through a three-pronged approach that involves growing the economy, cutting government waste and going after tax cheats. The latter proposal peaked the interest of our fact-checkers. We reached out to the Carter for evidence to back up the candidates claim. Spokesman Bryan Thomas pointed us to a January report from the state Department of Audits and Account, showing about $4.4 billion in delinquent state taxes. The reports authors estimate that $1.9 billion of the $4.4 billion is uncollected. But Thomas said strong leadership would improve collection of that money. You put the force of the governors office behind it, Thomas told The Augusta Chronicle earlier this month. At a press conference on Aug. 27th, Carter told reporters; Theres $2.5 billion that is uncollected out there from people who are cheating on their taxes, and against whom we arent enforcing the law. The auditors report, points out that about $815 million of the $2.5 billion is at least 15 years old – making it much harder to collect. Of course, that leaves two-thirds of the money apparently there for the taking, right? The left-leaning Georgia Budget & Policy Institute isnt so sure the plan is viable. Executive Director Alan Essig points out that once you account for the people and businesses that lack the means to pay, youre left with people who have intentionally dodged their responsibilities. Even when caught, those scofflaws arent likely to fork over the entire amount owed. Ramping up enforcement will yield more money, but just how much is unclear, he said. Are we talking about $3 million, $30 million, $300 million? Essig said. I dont know what the dollar amount is, and I dont think anyone knows it. Carters proposal to track down delinquent taxpayers is nothing new. Georgia made probably its biggest push to go after tax cheats when Sonny Perdue was governor and Bart Graham was revenue commissioner. We pulled a report that showed Graham identified 420,693 taxpayers that owed a combined $1.6 billion as of September 2003. Some of that debt dated back to 1988. Grahams agency chased down the money on several fronts. For instance, $23 million came in when the state refused to renew alcohol licenses for businesses with outstanding taxes. Another $18.6 million came in when the state began shaming scofflaws by posting their names on the internet. All told, the states two-year vigorous enforcement campaign collected $172.5 million – just 11 percent of what was owed. This is a messier process than (Carter) is suggesting, said Barbara Neuby, a political science professor at Kennesaw State University who specializes in public budgeting and finance. There is no automatic money that comes in once letters go out. Thats because collection would be handled through regulatory enforcement. The same laws that give state agencies broad powers to enforce taxation give people the right to appeal, Neuby said. The hearing process can take months and years, especially if the delinquents hire attorneys to fight enforcement. There is also the matter that some delinquent taxpayers may have legitimate reasons they have not paid – and therefore do not actually owe, Neuby said. State House Appropriations Committee Chairman Terry England, R-Auburn, said there are complications, even if the state could collect the amount in back taxes that Carters claiming. Nobody would argue putting it into education, England said. But thats one -time funds. The question becomes: What about the next year? he said. We circled back out to Thomas about some of the concerns that were expressed. Sen. Carter has never said that this is the only way to pay for the education investments we need, Thomas said. He has identified it as one of several ways to invest in our schools. Other efforts, such as cutting waste and improving efficiency in government, would provide sustained funding for schools, Thomas said. So where does this leave us? Carter said he believes the state can collect a substantial amount to help education by going after delinquent taxpayers. The states experience – and a report from state auditors – say that may be more challenging than he suggests. Carter has a point. But theres theres a lot of context missing from his proposal.",0.6,0.45,0.8,0.1971808762

Lincoln Chafee went before the General Assembly to offer his third State of the State address and talk about his proposed $8.2-billion 2013-2014 budget.Earlier in the day he released details of his budget package to the media and by the next day, his complete budget had been posted online.During his Jan. 16 speech to members of the House and Senate, Chafee declared, I submit this budget to the General Assembly on Jan. 16th – on time and the earliest that a governor has done so in over two decades.State law requires governors to submit their budgets to the legislature by the third Thursday in January (or the first Thursday in February if it's their first year in office). Chafee beat that deadline by one day.Submitting a budget early sounds like a good thing. At a briefing for reporters, Chafees director of administration, Richard Licht, said the early submittal reflected the discipline the governor has tried to bring to the whole budget process. And it will give the General Assembly more time to analyze it properly.We wondered whether Chafee's claim that his budget is the earliest to be submitted in more than two decades was true.We called his office to ask for their evidence.Meanwhile, we turned to the always-helpful Thomas Evans, the state librarian.Evans doesn't keep track of when a governor's budget is released, but he had data for when governors gave their State of the State/budget addresses and when their proposed budgets were submitted as legislation.It turns out, there can be a big gap between the two. For example, in 1989, the second year on Evans' list, Gov. Edward DiPrete addressed the General Assembly on Jan. 4, yet his budget bill wasn't introduced until March 1.In the previous 25 years, no governor has submitted a budget bill by the original deadline set by state law, according to Evans' data. (Extensions were written into the law for budgets submitted from 2005-2007 and for 2011 and 2012). Usually submission comes sometime in February. In eight years it was in March and in one year -- 1991 when Gov. Bruce Sundlun was dealing with the banking crisis -- it came April 9.We confirmed Evans dates using The Journal's archives and found that details of the budget are usually released a day or two before the budget bill is introduced.The earliest the budget bill itself has been submitted in the last 25 years is Feb. 1, said Evans. That was in 2005 and 2007 (during the administration of Gov. Donald Carcieri) and 2012 (Chafee's second year).Chafee's budget bill is on his website and Chafee spokeswoman Christine Hunsinger said it has been sent to the House.However, it has not been officially introduced and referred to a committee for analysis.Said Hunsinger: We hope they will introduce it Tuesday,That would be Jan. 22, still ten days earlier than the previous record.(If you have a claim youd like PolitiFact Rhode Island to check, e-mail us at emailprotected.

False Confidence (between 0 and 1): 0.2","Says border fencing finished near El Paso in 2010 dramatically curtailed illegal crossings, local crime and drug smuggling.","Conservative Paul Sperry highlighted fencing erected near El Paso a decade ago as evidence that President Donald Trumps proposed border wall could enhance security. Sperry wrote in a January 2018 New York Post commentary that the fencing, described as completed in 2010, explains a dramatic decrease in violent crime in the West Texas city and plummets in illegal crossings and drug smuggling. We wondered about that after Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, promoted Sperrys commentary on Twitter and Bob Moore, former executive editor of the El Paso Times, asserted in his own tweet that El Paso had low violent crime rates as far back as 2005 while illegal border crossings, Moore wrote, decreased for varied reasons around 2010 including the Great Recession. Sperry, whom we emailed without hearing back, wrote that once the fencing went up, illegal crossings and levels of violent crime and drug smuggling rapidly subsided and that since then, El Paso has consistently topped rankings for cities of 500,000 residents or more with low crime rates, based on FBI-collected statistics. We'd suggest that claims about anycitys safety rankbe considered with caution. Such rankings are oft tied to FBI statistics that the agency counsels against using to rank or compare communities. Weve also done several separate fact-checks noting flaws in claims about El Pasos safety standing. On another front, it appears the fencing touted by Sperry was not finished in 2010. Ramiro Cordero, a spokesman for the Border Patrols El Paso sector, which takes in New Mexico, El Paso County and part of adjoining Hudspeth County, advised by email that from 2007 to approximately 2014, two types of fencing got built near the El Paso metro area: double-layered mesh 18 feet tall and mesh on movable barriers going up 22 feet. In 2009, David Aguilar of the Border Patrol specified at a U.S. Senate hearing that 626 miles of congressionally ordered fencing had been completed along the border. When fully built, Aguilar said, the additions would cover 661 miles from Texas into California, counting 115 miles each in New Mexico and Texas. Decreased illegal alien apprehensions We exploredeach part of Sperrys statement separately, starting with whether the new fencing greatly diminished border crossings. All along the southwestern border, its worth noting, apprehensions by the Border Patrol peaked in 2000 at 1.6 million (yearly total) and later generally declined starting around the time of the 2008-09 recession, Michelle Mittelstadt of the Migration Policy Institute, a nonpartisan think tank that studies worldwide immigration, has noted. Mittelstadt told PolitiFact in April 2017 that factors in Mexico had contributed to the drop-offs including lower birth rates, increased educational levels and an improved economy. In his commentary, Sperry wrote that according to Homeland Security data, the number of deportable illegal immigrants located by the U.S. Border Patrol plummeted by more than 89 percent over the five-year period during which the fencing between El Paso and neighboring Ciudad Juarez, Mexico, was completed. Sperry said that when the El Paso fencing project started in 2006, illegal crossings totaled 122,261, but by 2010, when the 131-mile fence was completed from one end of El Paso out into the New Mexico desert, immigrant crossings shrank to just 12,251. They hit a low of 9,678 in 2012, before slowly ticking back up to a total of 25,193 last year. But theyre still well below pre-fence levels, and the Border Patrol credits the fortified barrier dividing El Paso from Mexico for the reduction in illegal flows, Sperry wrote. We found that he accurately recapped government-posted tallies of illegal alien apprehensions, which are generally used as a metric to measure illegal immigration. An exception: When we checked, the Border Patrol was reporting a slightly greater number of apprehensions in 2006, 122,656 making the 9,678 apprehensions in the sector in 2012 92 percent less than apprehensions in 2006. Unaddressed by Sperry: All along the nations southern border, according to the Border Patrol, apprehensions decreased each year from 2007 through 2011. That is, the agencys pre-2017 low of 327,577 apprehensions in 2011 was down 69 percent from 1,071,972 apprehensions in 2006 and down 72 percent from 1,171,396 apprehensions in 2005. Border Patrol video singles out change in tactics Next, we reached out to the Border Patrol to ask about the fencing alone driving down apprehensions. We fielded no comment from Carlos A. Diaz, the agencys Southwest Border branch chief, though he pointed us by email to a 2017 Customs and Border Protection video describing enforcement actions from 1992 through 2016 to stem illegal crossings. The El Paso portion of the video doesnt mention fencing. Rather, it singles out the 285,000 apprehensions made in the El Paso sector in 1993--which a narrator says was the year that the Border Patrol implemented Operation Hold the Line at El Paso calling for the forward deployment of agents and technology to high-traffic areas. Focusing on prevention through deterrence, the narrator continues, the strategy proved successful and apprehensions decreased over 70 percent in the sector in one year and in 2015, 14,495 apprehensions were made in the El Paso sector. That snippet led us to revisit federal tallies of apprehensions, which show both a post-1986 high of 285,981 apprehensions in the sector in 1993 and a 72 percent plummet to 79,688 apprehensions in 1994 though apprehensions increased the next two years, reaching 145,929 in 1996. In subsequent years through September 2017, the sector reported decreased apprehensions in 13 years and increased apprehensions in eight years; its 25,193 apprehensions in 2017 amounted to the sectors third-most in a decade, possibly a reminder that economic conditions on both sides of the border, or unsafe conditions in parts of Central America, also can sway decisions to cross the Rio Grande. Other Border Patrol views When we asked, a couple of Border Patrol officers credited the El Paso fencing with enhancingenforcement. Doug Mosier, a Customs and Border Protection spokesman, said hes worked as an El Paso-based agency public affairs officer since 1986. By email, Mosier said Operation Hold The Line revolutionized the way that border security was conducted in terms of federal law enforcement prevention efforts. Mosier said Silvestre Reyes, later elected to the U.S. House, had tried a similar strategy on a smaller scale when he was a Border Patrol chief in McAllen, Texas, and it worked well for that community. According to a 2013 El Paso Times news story, the approach instigated by Reyes, described as still in place, called for the deployment of every available Border Patrol agent to different sites along 20 miles of the El Paso-Juarez border, roughly from Sunland Park, N.M., to the Zaragoza port of entry. Mosier elaborated to us: So, as the chief of El Paso Sector in 1993, he essentially positioned as many U.S. Border Patrol agents as he could spare (approximately 250 agents) along a primary 20-mile stretch of border separating El Paso/Juarez, over a three-week period. The result was astounding, since illegal apprehensions immediately dropped by approximately 80-percent overnight. Crime and loitering also fell by the wayside in the downtown district, which was later substantiated in several surveys and polls taken by the El Paso Times, and the then--El Paso Herald Post. At first the border community was in shock, but that soon gave way to widespread support which manifested in improved living conditions for residents in El Paso, and in some areas of N.M. The Times story said that after Hold the Line was implemented, Reyes went on to urge more strategic fencing. Mosier, asked to assess the effects of the fencing, said that when primary pedestrian fencing (18-feet) was implemented in 2008, it provided effective infrastructure in much-needed areas of the border. It also improved USBP effectiveness by better directing illegal immigration into areas where Border Patrol had more resources to monitor traffic via technology, aircraft, combined with increased agent personnel. We said at that time, and still say today, that those combined resources, our strong working relationship with law enforcement partners, and the support by residents in El Paso were essential to the success of El Paso border security efforts, Mosier said. Cordero, who also told us hes worked for the agency in the sector for 18 years, agreed the fencing helped reduce apprehensions but, he said, other enforcement activities and cooperation between law agencies and with Mexican authorities also mattered. Victor Manjarrez Jr. of the University of Texas at El Paso told us he was the sector chief when the fencing went up. By email, Manjarrez deemed the fencing a factor in driving down apprehensions along with increased Border Patrol personnel, expanded technology and infrastructure including lights and roads. Although the pedestrian wall had a huge impact, Manjarrez said, so did the increase in Border Patrol agents driven by a 2004 congressional directive to beef up the agency. I would disagree that the wall was the sole reason for the decline in criminal activity, but it was a MAJOR factor in improving the quality of life. El Paso crime Sperry wrote that FBI crime-rate information shows the fencing drove down crime in El Paso. In fact, Sperry wrote, El Paso before 2010 was mired in violent crime and drug smuggling, thanks in large part to illicit activities spilling over from the Mexican side. Once the fence went up, however, things changed almost overnight. His commentary also said: According to FBI tables, property crimes in El Paso have plunged more than 37 percent to 12,357 from their pre-fence peak of 19,702 a year, while violent crimes have dropped more than 6 percent to 2,682 from a peak of 2,861 a year. Moore countered in a post-publication tweet that El Pasos violent crime rate was on the slide long before the fencing got built. Our search of the Nexis news database showed too that the El Paso County sheriff, Richard Wiles, told a U.S. Senate committee in 2009 that by that year, El Paso had been considered one of the countrys safest cities for a dozen years, long before the new fence was built, Wiles testified. Moore, answering our request for more information, emailed us his spreadsheet suggesting that each year from 2000 through 2016, El Pasos violent crime rate based on FBI data far trailed the average violent crime rate for like cities of 500,000 to 1 million residents. The FBIs posted figures enabled us to confirm that El Pasos violent crime rate trailed the national average for cities of 500,000 to 1 million residents from 1985 through 2016. The citys rate also mostly decreased year to year, the figures indicate, though the city still saw 11 year-to-year increases with the biggest rate bump, 10 percent, occurring in 2008. Conversely, El Pasos rate sank 10 percent or more 10 times in the 30 years including 1994, 1995, 1998, 2000, 2002, 2003, 2005 and 2006--all before the new fencing was mandated or fully installed--with the other big drops occurring in 1987 and 2013. Drug smuggling Sperry wrote that drug smuggling at the El Paso border entry point has also fallen dramatically. In fact, since the fence was completed, the volume of marijuana and cocaine coming through El Paso and seized by Border Patrol agents has been cut in half. The year before the wall was fully built in 2010, Sperry went on, the volume of illegal drugs confiscated by the feds along the El Paso border hit 87,725 pounds. The year after, the amount of drug seizures plummeted to 43,783 pounds. Last year, they dropped even further to a total of 34,329, according to Border Patrol reports obtained by The Post. We found slightly different figures. Regardless, a chart provided by Cordero showed that the dollar amount of illegal drug seizures in the El Paso sector substantially declined from 2007 through 2014, when the agencys $35.2 million in seizures was more than 400 percent less than the nearly $151 million in seizures in 2006. While seizures escalated in 2015 and 2016, reaching $54 million, they declined to $39 million in 2017, the agencys chart says. Drug Seizures, El Paso Sector, U.S. Border Patrol, Fiscal 2006 though Fiscal 2017         SOURCE: Email, Ramiro Cordero, agent, U.S, Border Patrol, El Paso sector, Jan. 18, 2018 We later ran these mostly reduced interdictions of illegal drugs past Sanho Tree, director of the Drug Policy Project at the Institute for Policy Studies, which calls itself Washingtons first progressive multi-issue think tank. Tree said by phone he wasnt aware of research on the effect of the El Paso fencing on drug smuggling. Yet generally, Tree said, declines in captured drugs dont necessarily signal fall-offs in smuggling, which relies on frequent shifts in methodology extending to drones, tunnels, even catapults. What you interdict shows you what youre catching, it doesnt show what youre not catching, Tree said, adding that its hard to model the effects on smuggling of particular law enforcement tacks. Local police agencies didnt engage withthis fact-check. Sgt. Enrique Carrillo of the El Paso Police Department replied by email: We are not commenting on this. Our requests to interview Sheriff Wiles went unfulfilled. Our ruling Sperry wrote that the fencing finished near El Paso in 2010 dramatically curtailed illegal crossings, local crime and drug smuggling. Such crossings evidently plunged after the fencing was built (though they later rebounded a bit) and it could be that drug smuggling fell off as well. Yet this claim fails to account for El Paso's violent crime rate trending down long before the fencing went up nor does it acknowledge other factors affecting security including apre-1995 shift in enforcement strategy and stepped-up Border Patrol staffing. We give the fencing some, not all, credit andrate this statement Half True. HALF TRUE – The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context.

When people do that, they transfer all kinds of chemicals from ladies private parts and thats where I think the (corona)virus came from.","A viral tweet attributed to televangelist Pat Robertson seemed too outlandish to be true. It was. Posted April 5, the tweet claimed that Pat Robertson believed he found the source of COVID-19 during an episode of The 700 Club. Robertson founded The 700 Club in 1966. He has hosted it since. The tweet is a screenshot of a quote. It says, Some of these young uns are doing all kinds of unnatural things with their sex organs. When people do that, they transfer all kinds of chemicals from ladies private parts and thats where I think the virus came from. We never had this kind of thing when I was coming up. But no one was committing oral sex back then. The tweet led to a Twitter trend for Pat Robertson and caused a spike in Google searches for Robertson. The quote has since been shared on Facebook and Reddit by angry users. Except Robertson didnt say it at all. The tweet was taken from a satire piece on The Business Standard News website. The Business Standard News is a satirical site designed to parody the 24-hour news cycle. The stories are outlandish, but reality is so strange nowadays they could be true, the sites about page said. We reached out to Christain Broadcasting Network just to be sure. CBN, founded by Robertson, confirmed he said no such thing. Robertson ran for president in 1988. He founded the Christian Coalition and the American Center for Law and Justice, which was labeled as the Christian response to the ACLU. He founded Regent University. He has owned several other businesses. Some people who responded to the tweet compared it to past controversial claims. In the 90s, he described feminists as people who practice witchcraft, destroy capitalism, and become lesbians. More recently, he told 700 Club viewers that he wishes there was a Facebook vomit button for every time he saw a gay couple kissing. Robertson has talked COVID-19 before, but he has not mentioned oral sex as being the cause. As for causes, Robertson did say that if your gut is healthy, you dont have to worry about corona.' In 2012, Robertson did weigh in on oral sex — he said it was okay, as long as it was between a husband and wife. A viral tweet attributed a quote to Robertson saying he believed oral sex and lady parts caused COVID-19. This originated from a satire website.",0,1,0.9,0.5589608643

Gov. Greg Abbotthas hammered the Biden administration on border issues throughoutMarch.First heaccusedthe administration ofreckless border policiesthathave released migrantswho tested positive for COVID-19into theU.S. And in recent weeks, the governor has focused on the uptick of unaccompanied minors arriving at the border. On March 30,Abbottclaimedin a tweetthat twice as many children are in Border Patrol custody under Biden than Trump peak in 2019. The Biden Admin. is unprepared for the crises they have caused,Abbottcontinued, adding that state police andNationalGuardforces have been dispatched to assistinthe situation. 2019 wasthe last year border authorities recorded a surge in migrant children and familycrossings. And authorities believe that the number of encounters this year will surpass levels seenthen. But is it true that the number of unaccompanied minorsin federal custody today isalready twice thehighestnumberrecordedin 2019 underformer PresidentDonaldTrump? Abbotts claim cited an article published Tuesday by the Washington Examiner, a conservativeWashington,D.C.,newssite.Citing federal data exclusively obtained Monday evening, the website reported the same claim. U.S. Customs and Border Protectionconfirmedthe numbers. Under Trump, the government recordeda peak of 2,600 unaccompanied minorsin federal custody in June 2019.In 2020, the Trump administrationstopped taking minors into custody after it implemented a policy that immediately expelled all people crossing the border, including children, citing COVID-19 precautions. The Biden administration suspended that policy for children in January and now allowschildren who cross the border aloneto remain in theU.S. while they await immigration courtproceedings. U.S. Customs and Border Protectionalso released to PolitiFact a daily memo reporting the number of unaccompanied children in government custody. As ofMarch 29, the number of unaccompanied children in custody was 5,160,whichisnearly twice the number recorded in June 2019. The memo also reported that an average of 492 unaccompanied children were being placed in federal custody each dayinMarch, whilean averageof399were being transferred out of custody daily. With facility intake consistently outpacing output,obviously, those numbers are going to stack up, a seniorU.S. Customs and Border Protectionofficial told reporters during aMarch 26briefing. Migrant childrencanbeheld atBorderPatrol facilitiesfor a maximumof72hours, a rule set forth under theTrafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of 2008.From there, children are referred to the Office of Refugee Resettlement, within U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, which is tasked with providing care for the minors and connecting them with suitable sponsors. But the strain the high number of migrant children has placed on the system has caused many minors to be held up at theBorderPatrol facilitiesbeyond the 72-hour limit.(The Trump administration also struggled with meeting thatlimit.)As of March 30, for instance,more than2,000 children being held at a Border Patrol facility in Donna had been there for more than 72 hours, according toPro Publica. We need to do a better job of ensuring that HHS and ORR has greater capacity, and we need to speed up the transfer of these children from our custody to their custody much faster, theBorder Patrolofficial said. The Biden administration has raced to establishgreater capacity in the Office of RefugeeResettlementto relieve the bottleneck withinBorder Patrolfacilities.The agency has activated or opened what it calls influxcare facilities, which areunlicensed care facilities that offer surplus shelter space and can be set up in a matter of weeks, and emergency intake sites, which are new facilities that serve as waystations forunaccompaniedchildren moving fromBorderPatrolcustody to Office of Refugee Resettlement custody, according to the U.S. Committee for Refugees and Immigrants. Many of these new or temporary shelters have been opened across Texas. Influx care facilities now operate inCarrizoSprings and Pecos; emergencyintake sites have been openedin a Dallas convention centeranda former oil workers' camp in Midland. Its difficult to pinpoint the precise factors that are causing todaysnumbersof unaccompanied children to double2019s peak, experts say. Immigration experts often separatemigration driversintotwo categories:push factors,or theconditions in origin countries that are causing people toleave home;and pull factors,orthe conditionsof a destination country that make it a more attractive place to live. Immigration policies in the U.S. are often listed as a significant pull factor, and Bidenrelaxing those policies following Trumps immigration austerityis often cited as a significantone. But many experts say thatitsthepush factorsinmigrants home countries that are strong drivers of migrationinto the U.S.In2019, Honduras struggled with civil unrest and an increase in gang violence, while Guatemalans wrestledwith environmental issues that impacted the populations food security. This year, Honduras, Guatemala andNicaragua suffered two category-4 hurricanes that struck the region within a two-week span.Withmillions left in need of aid, the hurricanes exacerbated poverty and worsened access to clean water, giving an extra nudge to people considering northern migration. The hurricanes made a huge difference, saidYael Schacher, senior U.S. advocate at Refugees International. People were in a situation where they were just getting by, and then the hurricane wiped them out. Abbott said in a tweet that twice as many unaccompanied children are inBorder Patrolcustodypresently than during the peak number seen in 2019 under Trump. Numbers from U.S. Customs and Border Protection verify this claim.The Trump administration recorded 2,600 minors inBorder Patrolcustody in June 2019, which was the highest amount seen during Trumps term. As of March 29,5,160 minors were inBorder Patrolcustody waiting to be transferred to the Office of Refugee Resettlement, which is 40 minors short of double 2,600.",1,0,1,0.1324024402

False Confidence (between 0 and 1): 0.6","Says Bill Nelson sold agricultural land for home development, pocketing at least $1.4 million.","A hokey political commercialfrom the conservative super PAC American Crossroads lambasts Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson as a politician who has gotten out of paying property taxes.After 40 years in politics, Bill Nelson has learned how to milk the system. He leased land that he owned for six cows, taking advantage of an agricultural tax loophole to dodge $43,000 in taxes just last year, the narrator says. Then he sold the land for home development, pocketing at least $1.4 million.The kicker: Tax breaks and big profits for him, higher taxes for the rest of us. Here, we will look at whether he sold the land for home development for at least $1.4 million.The greenbelt exemptionAs evidence for the ad, Crossroads spokesman Nate Hodson referred us to a February 2012 Tampa Bay Timesstory that scrutinized Nelsons qualifications for a greenbelt assessment, which spares him from paying higher taxes on his familys 55-acre pasture along the Indian River. Instead of paying taxes on the market value, his tax bill is based on a much lower agricultural assessment.Nelson gets the greenbelt assessment for his Brevard County pasture because he leases the land to a small-time cattle owner. The current lessee, cattleman Jeff Darby, has a herd of about six cows and uses the land free of charge, though he is tasked with maintenance.The greenbelt law was enacted in 1959 as a financial incentive for farmers to keep their land as developers bought up farm land for malls, highways and homes.Without the lower agricultural rate, Nelson would have paid about $43,000 in higher taxes on the land.The ad gives voters the impression that Nelson parked some cows on land to save money on his taxes and then axed the cows in a land sale to developers. (The ad sends the cows flying with the arrival of a new brick house from the sky.)Such a move obviously goes against the spirit of the greenbelt law, though its legal, and it happens. The problem with the greenbelt law, critics say, is that its written too broadly. Under the law, county property appraisers are tasked with determining if the land is used primarily for bona fide agricultural purposes.The Brevard County property appraisers office has tried to remove Nelsons greenbelt designation in the past, but Nelson fought to keep it and won in court. (An inspector in 1999 went to his property and found no cows; Nelson argued they escaped via a hole in the fence.)Nelsons land salesThe ad leaves out a lot of important context about that $1.4 million profit that Nelson supposedly gained from land sales.When Nelson moved to Tallahassee in the mid 90s to serve on the state Cabinet, he sold the main house that he lived in, which is adjacent to the pasture.He sold four more nearby lots after he moved to Washington, D.C., to serve as a U.S. senator. Two of these were residential lots that had houses on them. Two more were lots that he cut out of his pastureland, so those had used the greenbelt exemption. The total for these four transactions to private homeowners is at least $1.4 million, the Times reported. Floridas greenbelt law does not require him to pay back part of his tax break.Nelsons campaign does not dispute the $1.4 million total -- they do dispute how American Crossroads presented the transactions. That total does not represent all of the money he received from the agricultural lots; it also includes the sales of two residential lots.The ad is leading viewers to equate the land that got the tax break with the land he sold for $1.4 million, and thats plainly wrong. Nelson did not sell the entire pasture. The cows still graze on it, and Nelson has indicated that will not change for the land his family has had since 1924.I've looked at all the options on the rest of the property and I've decided not to develop it. I want to leave it to my kids, Nelson told the Times in February.Our rulingIts not fully accurate for Crossroads to say Nelson took land that was receiving agricultural tax breaks and sold it for home development at a profit of $1.4 million. For one, the land that earned the tax break -- a 55-acre pasture -- is still a pasture. He did not sell that land for home development.Nelson has sold two agricultural lots, but those sales do not total $1.4 million. To get there, you have to factor in two more sales of residential lots adjoining the pasture. Those lots already had homes on them when Nelson sold them.American Crossroads is cherry-picking a figure from the Times story to incite anger against Nelsons tax break without telling the entire story.",0.4,0.7,0.9,0.9601865379

False Confidence (between 0 and 1): 0.05",The University of Wisconsin System budget is the biggest it has ever been.,"The 2015-16 academic year ended with pomp, circumstance -- and skirmishes between Gov. Scott Walker and professors in the University of Wisconsin System. Several days later, on May 16, 2016, Walker kept up the offensive in an interview on WTMJ-AM in Milwaukee. We have some of the best schools in the country, no doubt about it, Walker told conservative talk show host Charlie Sykes. But weve got to stop feeding into this national perception that how much you pay in tuition suddenly is a correlation to what the value is. Yeah, you want to have a reasonable level of support for the system; and we do. In fact, by the way, Walker continued, the University of Wisconsin System budget is the biggest it has ever been. The amount of money they get from state government is only a fraction of what they have overall. So, for all this hysteria out there, they have never had more money to spend in the UW System. With the 2015-17 state budget, Walker and his fellow Republicans in the Legislature cut $250 million over the two years from the UW System. That was an 11 percent reduction in state support and a big reason for the no-confidence votes. So, we wondered about Walkers claim that UW Systems budget is the biggest its ever been. Hes essentially correct, but with some caveats. Walker was referring to the systems all-funds budget -- which, as the name suggests, is comprehensive. It includes state tax dollars, but also an array of other funds, such as tuition, revenue from enterprises such as dormitories and athletics, federal research dollars and gifts.  We asked for budget figures from the nonpartisan Legislative Fiscal Bureau for the entire history of the UW System, which began in 1973-'74. Heres a look at the last six years, when the figures were highest. Year All-funds budget -- actual All-funds budget -- adjusted for inflation 2010-11 $5.591 billion $6.077 billion 2011-12 $5.589 billion $5.889 billion 2012-13 $5.901 billion $6.092 billion 2013-14 $5.997 billion $6.101 billion 2014-15 $6.098 billion $6.105 billion 2015-16 $6.194 billion* $6.059 billion As you might expect, the current all-funds budget (2015-16) is the largest on record. But with an asterisk. Thats because in 2015-16, for the first time, the UW System included unspent tuition money carried over from the previous year in its all-funds budget. If that money wasnt included, the 2015-16 all-funds budget would have been $6.059 billion -- the second-highest ever, behind 2014-15, rather than $6.194 billion. Adjusted for inflation -- a better measure for comparing figures over time -- the 2015-16 all funds budget is slightly smaller than in four of the five previous years, but still near the top. State support Walker made it clear his claim was about total funding for the UW System, and that state money covers only a portion of the systems budget. But its worth noting that, adjusted for inflation, state support of the system -- known as general purpose revenue -- is in a historic decline, according to figures from the fiscal bureau. The highest state support, adjusted for inflation, was in the first year of the system, 1973-74 -- at just under $1.52 billion. That figure hit an all-time low of $1.03 billion in 2015-16. UW System officials often cite the reduction in state support because they have generally have more flexibility in spending state tax dollars than with revenues that are designated for certain purposes. Our rating Walker said: The University of Wisconsin System budget is the biggest it has ever been. The systems 2015-16 all-funds budget -- which includes not only state tax dollars but federal funds, tuition and other income -- is $6.194 billion, the biggest since the system was created in 1973-74. But adjusted for inflation, the 2015-16 all-funds budget is among the biggest, though not the biggest. And the 2015-16 figure includes unspent tuition revenue that hadnt been counted in the all-funds budget in previous years. For a statement that is accurate but needs clarification, our rating is Mostly True.",0.85,0.3,0.9,0.8335106766

False Confidence (between 0 and 1): 0.1",Manufacturing wages today in America on a per-hour basis are actually a bit lower than average wages in the economy as a whole.,"Former car czar Steven Rattner, who actually hates the nickname he earned overseeing the auto bailout, is pushing back against proclamations of a flourishing American manufacturing industry. Again. Rattner wrote an eye-catching New York Times op-ed in January calling the industrys post-recession jobs gains a trickle, arguing we need to get real about the so-called renaissance partly because wages for auto workers andmanufacturersdropped far more than the average private-sector worker since the end of the recession in June 2009. He revisited some of those points in a March 30, 2014, appearance on ABCs This Week, which took a break from coverage of Russia and the missing Malaysian plane to examine the state of Made in the USA. We certainly want these kinds of advanced manufacturing jobs. But remember this, manufacturing wages today in America on a per-hour basis are actually a bit lower than average wages in the economy as a whole, he said. And what I mean by that is there are lots of really good high-paying jobs in sectors like education, like IT, like health care, service sectors that are not just entry-level jobs, they are really high-paying jobs, and this is our competitive advantage. Manufacturing jobs are typically seen as a source of higher pay for people who dont earn college degrees, and President Barack Obama put an emphasis on them in his State of the Union address. So PunditFact wondered if Rattner is right: Are per-hour wages in manufacturing a little smaller than average wages for the rest of the American economy? Rattner pointed to U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics data for average hourly earnings of production and nonsupervisory employees in the private sector, which make up about four-fifths of total private-sector employment. The most recent data for February 2014 shows the average hourly private-sector wage was $20.50. The manufacturing industry average was, as Rattner said, a bit lower at $19.43. Hourly wages are almost $3 higher for employees who produce durable goods, such as cars, phones and computers, than those who make nondurable goods, or things like food, gas and clothes. Weekly wages tell a different story, with manufacturers earning almost $122 more a week than the total worker average in February. The reason for the discrepancy between hourly and weekly wages is simple: Manufacturers work more hours. Anyone can work more hours and make more money, Rattner said. But manufacturers also earn more money an hour when you factor in supervisors. BLS data for February show average hourly earnings are $24.31 for all private-sector employees and $24.72 for manufacturing employees -- the opposite of what Rattner said. Which dataset is better? The question can incite an economists quarrel. Dean Baker, a liberal economist and co-director of the Center for Economic Policy Research, took issue with isolating a dataset that excludes supervisors, saying analysts see the distinction as arbitrary and are increasingly using the whole workforce for their research. The manufacturing industry has a lower percentage of production employees (70.1 percent) than the average for the private-sector workforce (82.7 percent), which accounts for the higher pay when usingRattner's measure, Baker said. Rattner argues viewing the data his way is more representative of the typical workers earnings without being influenced by the top of the pay scale. Another liberal economist and former Obama administration adviser, Jared Bernstein of the Center for Budget Policies and Priorities, faulted Rattner for excluding benefits on top of wages. Manufacturing workers often have benefits, he said. Another BLS source for wage data (yes, there are a lot of them) shows that when looking at total compensation (wages plus benefits), manufacturing workers earn $35.14 an hour, which is higher than the $28.44 average for careers in the service-providing industry and $29.63 for all private-sector workers in December 2013. Since it's widely believed that workers trade off benefit pay for lower wages, it's a mistake to just consider wages in this sort of comparison when you're dealing with an industry that pays benefits (as opposed to say, fast food), Bernstein said. Matthew Lavoie, National Association of Manufacturers spokesman, said 97 percent of the groups 12,000 members provide health insurance. Rattner conceded manufacturers earn more than service-industry workers when benefits are included in his New York Times column. In our interview with Rattner, he anticipated these objections to his claim. But my point remains the same: The perception that manufacturing jobs are better jobs is out of date, Rattner wrote. Note also that over the past year, per-hour wages for all industries rose by 50 cents per hour but in manufacturing, they rose by only 21 cents per hour. The trend is not manufacturing's friend, as my NYT piece pointed out. Our ruling Rattner was careful on This Week to single out data for per-hour wages when he argued manufacturers are not paid as much as the rest of workforce. His claim relies on the most recent data for production workers in the manufacturing industry, who earn about $1 less than the average of their private-sector counterparts. However, factoring in supervisors shows manufacturers make 41 cents more per hour. Adding benefits gives manufacturers more of an edge. We wont take sides and say what dataset we think is best. What we can say is that Rattner makes an accurate point by one measure.",0.7,0.3,0.8,0.9296613396

False Confidence (between 0 and 1): 0.9",SaysGeorgia becomes first state to ban Muslim culture in historic move to restore Western values.,"A post that appears to have originated from fake news purveyors in Macedonia used a real news item from months ago to falsely say the U.S. state of Georgia has outlawed Muslim culture. A March 13, 2017, post on USANewsPost.us carried the headline, Georgia becomes first state to ban Muslim culture in historic move to restore Western values.  Facebook users flagged the post as potentially being fake, as part of the social media giants efforts to remove fake news from news feeds. PolitiFact Georgia examined the origins of this claim as part of the inauguralInternational Fact-Checking Day, April 2, 2017. Organizers at Poynter.orgdescribe the day as not a single event but a rallying cry for more facts - and fact-checking - in politics, journalism, and everyday life. The story cited an actual event — a Peach State lawmaker had introduced a bill in November 2016 in the Georgia General Assembly that would have banned the wearing of burqas, niqabs and veils. The story trumpeted the bill as being about keeping the American people safe. But the post did not indicate that the legislation never became law. State Rep. Jason Spencer on Nov. 15 filed HB 3 for the 2017 legislative session. The bill aimed to expand the scope of a state law passed in 1951 that made wearing a mask a misdemeanor (unless it was for celebrations, work, sports or emergencies). The original law aimed to prevent Ku Klux Klan members from wearing their hoods. Spencers bill could have prevented Muslim women from wearing any kind of head covering while driving, or possibly even while on public property. It also prevented people from wearing veils in drivers licenses and government-issued IDs, a rule the state already had. This bill is simply a response to constituents that do have concerns of the rise of Islamic terrorism, and we in the State of Georgia do not want our laws used against us, Spencer told Atlantas WSB-TV. The quote is cited in the USANewsPost.us article, which made an inference that if the bill passed, Georgia would have stopped Muslim culture in a way no other state had. (For the most part, the wearing of religious headcoverings is protected by the First Amendment.) But the bill didnt pass the General Assembly, because Spencer withdrew the measure just two days later. After further consideration, I have decided to not pursue HB 3 in the upcoming 2017 legislative session due to the visceral reaction it has created, he said in a statement. While this bill does not contain language that specifically targets any group, I am mindful of the perception that it has created. My objective was to address radical elements that could pose a threat to public safety. However, further consideration dictates that other solutions will need to be considered. In conclusion, anti-masking statutes have been upheld as constitutional (State vs Miller, 1990), and HB 3 would withstand legal scrutiny, but not political scrutiny. The Miller case to which Spencer refers involved a Klan member who challenged the Anti-Mask Act and lost. USANewsPost.us cites DailyUSAUpdate.com as the source of the post, and that site in turn says the post came from OpenMagazines.com. The story also has been shared on Facebook, across several other websites, tens of thousands of times. We contacted OpenMagazines.com via email to ask them about the misleading headline but didnt hear back. BuzzFeed has previously reported that both OpenMagazines.com and DailyUSAUpdate.com are registered to owners in Macedonia. The former Yugoslav republic became a hotbed of fake news during last years presidential election. Buzzfeed found that teenagers in the town of Veles operated at least 140 websites that published fake political news in the United States to draw in advertising dollars. USANewsPost.us also is registered to an administrator and address in Veles. Our ruling Bloggers said in a headline, Georgia becomes first state to ban Muslim culture in historic move to restore Western values. The post misrepresents the outcome of a months-old and short-lived legislative proposal from November 2016 that could have prevented Muslim women from hearing veils and headscarves. Muslim culture was not banned, although it did appear to briefly be under attack.",0.2,0.9,0.6,0.5026631494

To give some perspective, just under 1,500 people died from the flu in the past 10 years, Cohen said. In just 11 months, Covid has killed more than three times that number. Is it true that the coronavirus has killed more North Carolinians in a year than the flu has in 10 years? According to the states data, yes. North Carolinas Department of Health and Human Services tracks both COVID-19 and influenza deaths. As of Wednesday morning, the state had counted 5,284 COVID-19 deaths. DHHS says those deaths include people who have had a positive molecular or antigen test for COVID-19, who died without fully recovering from COVID-19, and who had no alternative cause of death identified. The deaths are reported by hospitals and clinicians directly to the local and state health departments. The first reported COVID-19 death did, indeed, occur on March 12. The states health department also tracks flu deaths and reports each flu seasons data on its website. Flu deaths are reported by health providers and were confirmed as influenza by an appropriate laboratory or rapid diagnostic test. PolitiFact reviewed the last 10 flu seasons, dating back to the 2010-2011 season. In total, we counted 1,486 reported flu deaths. DHHS spokeswoman Kelly Haight confirmed to us by phone that our total is accurate. Heres a list of the flu death counts by season, and a link to the report for each respective season: 2019-2020: 186 2018-2019: 203 2017-2018: 391 2016-2017: 218 2015-2016: 59 2014-2015: 218 2013-2014: 107 2012-2013: 59 2011-2012: 9 2010-2011: 36 The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention also tracks flu deaths by state. At a glance, it might seem like the CDC and North Carolina reports contradict one other. For instance, the CDC reported North Carolina had 2,064 flu deaths in 2018, while the states health department reported far less. Thats because the CDC sometimes combines flu and pneumonia deaths together, officials said. Under the flu & pneumonia section on the CDCs flu deaths by state website, most of those deaths are pneumonia deaths, said Jeff Lancashire, acting associate director for communications for the CDCs National Center for Health Statistics. Some pneumonia deaths are caused by the flu, but some can be caused by many other viruses, bacteria, bacteria-like organisms and fungi, said Kelly Haight, DHHS spokeswoman. The year 2018 is the most recent year of flu deaths available on the CDC site. If you start in 2018 and look back 10 years to 1999, Lancashire said there were 1,806 deaths from exclusively flu alone – without pneumonia (from the public database CDC WONDER – wonder.cdc.gov). So if Dr. Cohen was citing deaths from flu alone, she would be correct that COVID19 deaths have exceeded that (number) in NC, he said. The CDC has noted, however, that tallying death counts for COVID-19, flu and pneumonia is complicated and sometimes its data can be incomplete. Cohen said COVID-19 has killed more North Carolinians in a year than the flu has in the last 10 years. By the North Carolina health departments count, there have been 5,200 COVID-19 deaths this year and 1,486 flu deaths over the last decade. Cohens claim also tracks with data collected by the CDC, according to an agency spokesman. However, the CDC points out that exact numbers can be tricky to count because there are sometimes delays in processing death information.",1,0,1,0.3428221419

Perry was asked in a CNBC interview if he believed carbon dioxide was the primary control knob for the earths temperature. No. Most likely the primary control knob is the ocean waters and this environment that we live in, Perry said in the June 19 interview. We decided to investigate Perrys claim about climate changes main cause, which scientists have likened to a control knob. Perrys claim flies in the face of settled science. The worlds leading authority on climate change, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, has concluded that human activity is extremely likely to be the main driver of warming since the mid 20th century. While its still possible to find dissenters, scientists around the globe generally agree with this conclusion. The graph below, based on work by NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies, shows just how closely human activity syncs with the earths rising temperature, especially since 1950. The blue line shows how human factors (land use, ozone, aerosols and greenhouse gases) have contributed to global warming. The black line is the Earths recorded temperature since 1880.  This is not to say natural factors dont affect the climate. They do. But Perry is wrong to call them the main cause of the earths rising temperature. When you look at how natural causes (orbital and solar changes plus volcanic activity) have contributed to climate change, its clear the impact is less than that of human factors.  Perry is also wrong to say ocean waters are responsible for the uptick in temperature. While oceans are a vital part of the climate system, and variations in their circulation can affect local climates in important ways, they dont account for global warming, said Gavin Schmidt, climatologist and director of NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies. We have concluded close to all of the recent trends in global temperature is due to human activity, and CO2 is the dominant factor, Schmidt said, referring to carbon dioxide. Perry misidentified climate changes main control knob, but hes not the first Trump administration department head to fudge the facts on our warming planet. We previously issued a False rating to Environmental Protection Agency chief Scott Pruitts claim that carbon dioxide is not a primary contributor to the global warming that we see. In fact, carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas that collects in the earths atmosphere and traps excess heat. It has functioned like a primary control knob thats been dialed up dramatically since humans began releasing significantly more amounts of CO2 into the air, mostly by burning fossil fuels, at the dawn of the Industrial Revolution. A reasonable analogy can be drawn between the way that atmospheric CO2 controls the global temperature of the Earth, and how your house thermostat controls the temperature of your house, said Andrew Lacis, a climatologist at NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies. The NASA graph below shows the influence of greenhouse gas emissions, including a 40 percent increase in atmospheric CO2 since 1750 (green line), on the Earths temperature (black line).  Energy Secretary Rick Perry said, Most likely the primary control knob (for the earths temperature) is the ocean waters and this environment that we live in. Perrys claim contradicts settled science. While natural factors certainly affect the climate, human factors are the main contributor to global warming, and carbon dioxide has acted as the primary control knob governing the earths relatively recent uptick in temperature.

Retirees and families in Florida — they believed Donald Trump when he said he'd build them some condos. Thousands of them, Kaine said on the third night of the Democratic National Convention. They paid their deposits, but the condos, they were never built. He just pocketed their money and walked away. They lost tens of thousands of dollars, all because they believed Donald Trump. A Kaine spokesman told us the senator was referring to not one, but two failed condo projects: One in Tampa and one in Fort Lauderdale. Trumps campaign did not respond. We wanted to know if people lost tens of thousands of dollars in deposits while Trump took the money without consequence. Since there are two projects, well take them one at a time. Trump Tower Tampa In 2004, at the height of the Tampa real estate boom, local developers incorporated under the name SimDag/Robel contacted Trump to ask him to partner on a condo tower they wanted to build. The group eventually reached a licensing agreement with Trump: He would lend his name to Trump Tower Tampa for $2 million plus a percentage of condo sales. The document stipulated that neither the developers nor Trump would under any circumstances disclose or permit to be disclosed the existence of this agreement.'' No one would know Trumps involvement was in name only. Trump announced the deal on Jan. 10, 2005, saying he would partner with SimDag/Robel to build a 52-story, 190-unit condo tower in downtown Tampa. (Less than two weeks later, Trump married Slovenian model Melania Knauss in a Palm Beach wedding attended by now-rival Hillary Clinton.) The next month, Trump and his new bride attended a sales launch in Tampa. Trump told reporters at a gala reception with 600 guests that he had a substantial stake in the project and that units were selling well. Now, its here well note that Kaine said in his speech there were thousands of them, which his spokesman said was referring to thousands of dollars. By the time Trump came to Tampa, customers had placed sizable deposits on all 190 units, which cost between $700,000 and $6 million. The amount of those deposits varied depending on the unit. With 190 units, Kaines description of the customers as retirees and families is a plausible definition. Tampa Bay Times reporter Susan Taylor Martin noted customers included doctors, NFL coaches, a video game developer and more. Under the sales agreement, half of the deposit cash went into an escrow account, while the other half went to construction costs. But the project ran over budget quickly. The site required a redesign of the foundation, and construction issues soon ballooned the cost of the project from initially being $227 million to $300 million. In 2006, the developers held a groundbreaking, but had yet to secure financing. Trumps licensing agreement was modified that year, giving him $4 million but conceding a cut of the sales. SimDag/Robel stopped paying, and Trump sued in May 2007, claiming he was owed $1.03 million in licensing fees. That lawsuit was the first indication for buyers that Trump was only slapping his name on the project. SimDag/Robel countersued Trump for breaking the confidentiality of the licensing agreement by complaining publicly about the project. Trump and the developers settled in 2008. SimDag/Robel called off the entire project and declared bankruptcy. Buyers, meanwhile, were out of luck. While the escrow half of their deposits was returned, the other half had been eaten up by construction costs. Some customers were out as much as $250,000 or more. Several dozen buyers sued Trump in 2009, arguing that they had been misled with fraudulent and negligent misrepresentations that the billionaire was more involved with the project bearing his name. Within three years, the buyers in the lawsuit reached settlements. Some were repaid as little as $11,115, according to the Times. Other buyers not a part of the suit received nothing. Jay McLaughlin, a physical therapist from Connecticut, told the Times he lost almost $90,000. An attorney named Mary Ann Stiles told the newspaper she was out $200,000. Other investors who gave SimDag/Robel money said they lost six- and seven-figure sums. Trump International Hotel & Tower Fort Lauderdale A similar scenario played out on Floridas Atlantic coast, when Trump struck a secretive deal with a group of developers to lend his name to a building. The Trump International Hotel & Tower Fort Lauderdale was slated to be a 24-story, 298-unit condo hotel, in which owners rent out their units like hotel rooms. When the project was unveiled in 2004, units cost between $500,000 and $3 million, with 20 percent deposits required. Buyers were wooed with brochures touting Trumps involvement, including one in which Trump said the resort was the finest and most luxurious experience I have created. Units sold well through 2006, and these deposits were split the same way as Trump Tower Tampa. Also like Tampa, construction costs soon spiraled out of control. The building was slated to be finished by December 2007 but was nowhere near done. Then one of the developing partners, Bayrock Group, sold its interest to an Icelandic investment firm for $50 million. The following year, Trump began to voice major concerns to development partner Roy Stillman of SB Hotel Associates that work wasnt being completed, despite some $140 million being spent on construction. The real estate market began its tailspin and the partners had difficulty securing more financing. In 2009, Trump decided to strip his name off the project after Stillman attempted to close with buyers to get more money, even though the building wasnt yet completed. With $185 million in debt and no billionaire name recognition, Trump International Hotel & Tower Fort Lauderdale was dead. What Trump actually made on this deal is much more obscure, because the entire project ended in more than a dozen lawsuits among Trump, the developers and the buyers. (Lawsuits against Trump also have resulted in other developments in which Trump licensed his name in places like Canada, Hawaii and Mexico.) One depositor, Naraine Seecharan, told the Miami Herald he was recovering from the removal of a brain tumor when he learned about the fate of his $289,000 down payment. J. Michael Goodson of New Jersey said he put down $345,000 and sued Trump. Pembroke Pines attorney Joseph Altschul represented more than 70 clients who said they had paid about $8 million in deposits. In all, more than 100 buyers filed lawsuits. CFLB Partnership bought the unfinished project in 2013 for $115 million, finishing the building andrenaming it the Conrad Fort Lauderdale Resort & Residences. Trump and the developers continued to argue. Trump also sued the developers, saying he lost millions in licensing and hotel management fees over the deal. He maintained in the various lawsuits he held no liability, while the partners struggled to reach settlements with buyers. (Trumps attorneys also got in trouble for hiding a $5 million insurance policy to help cover lawsuits for making misleading statements.) Well, the word developing, it doesn't mean that we're the developers, Trump said in a 2013 deposition. We worked on the documents, we worked on the room sizes and the things, but we didn't give out the contracts, we didn't get the financing, we weren't the developer, but we did work with the developer. Trump and his affiliated companies have not been found at fault in the Fort Lauderdale lawsuits, thanks to contract language that stated Trumps involvement was in name only. His legal team maintained the suits against him were more about Trumps money and anger over the housing crash. The billionaire maintained that buyers were better off losing deposit money than taking more of abath in a bad real estate investment, as the condos were worth roughly half what people would have paid in full. In one 2014 trip to the witness stand, he said someone would have to be very stupid to have still attempted to buy a condo in the building after the real estate crash. Only a fool would have closed under those circumstances, Trump said. In April 2016, a Florida appeals court ruled on the last two active cases seeking deposits. The three-judge-panel upheld prior findings that Trump did not misrepresent his role in the development. Our ruling Kaine said Florida retirees and families lost tens of thousands of dollars in deposits onfailed Trump condo projects, but he pocketed their money and walked away. Its clear that many buyers, whatever their occupation or familial status, indeed lost at least that much in the failed Trump projects in Tampa and Fort Lauderdale. Some were further compensated partially with settlements after suing the billionaire. Whether Trump cheated them is another matter. While his licensing agreements with the developers were secret, he was entitled to a certain amount of money for putting his name on the building. He was sued by several dozen angry buyers and either settled or was found not at fault, which is not the same as walking away without addressing the problems. Kaines statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/b0c3e425-5851-49f6-9bec-ecace6975c3c",0.8,0.2,1,0.798161882

False Confidence (between 0 and 1): 0.9",ACORN will be a paid partner with the Census Bureau and they will be in charge of going door-to-door and collecting data from the American public.,"Rep. Michele Bachmann sparked a new controversy recently when she declared she would provide the bare minimum to Census takers because she was concerned about the Census Bureau's partnership with ACORN, a left-leaning group that has become a popular villain for Republicans. (You remember ACORN: Formally known as the Association of Community Organization for Reform Now, it was lambasted in 2008 by many Republicans because its voter registration efforts included some fraudulent names such as Mickey Mouse. ACORN leaders said they discovered the fake names, notified authorities and fired some workers who cut corners. But Republican leaders still say it was a willful effort to manipulate the election to help the group's liberal agenda.) Here's how Bachmann explained her concerns in aWashington Timesinterview (which you can listen tohere): Now ACORN has been named one of the national partners, which will be a recipient again of federal money, Bachmann said. And they will be in charge of going door-to-door and collecting data from the American public. This is very concerning because the motherload of all data information will be from the Census. And, of course, we think of the Census as just counting how many people live in your home. Unfortunately, the Census data has become very intricate, very personal (with) a lot of the questions that are asked. And I know for my family the only question that we will be answering is how many people are in our home. We won't be answering any information beyond that, because the Constitution doesn't require any information beyond that. Bachmann packs a lot of bad information into a short space there. So in this item we'll deal with her latest claim about ACORN, and we'll deal with her claim about the constitutional requirement witha different item. She is wildly wrong with her chraracterization of the Census Bureau's partnership program. Yes, the bureaudoespartner with organizations to help recruit workers. To date, it has 30,000 such partners. ACORN is one. Partners agree to promote the 2010 Census among their constituents. As a partner, ACORN has agreed to spread the word among its people about the availability of temporary Census jobs. The U.S. Census Bureau expects to hire 1.4 million people through the course of the 2010 census, the bulk of them to do the door-to-door questionnaires, so the bureau casts a wide net to get applicants, including through its partners. Partners don't get paid, but they presumably benefit by getting the word out to members about jobs, and also by providing a public service emphasizing the importance of filling out the Census. According to Census Bureau information provided to Congress on June 1, 2009, ACORN and other partner organizations simply promote the availability of temporary Census jobs, but have no role in the terms or conditions of employment beyond promotion of the availability of temporary jobs. Applicants that are hired by the Census Bureau to work on the 2010 Census are required to go through a background check that includes an FBI name check and fingerprint check so that felons are not hired to work on the 2010 Census. Partners are also encouraged to donate testing space for the millions of people who will apply for the temporary Census jobs. No payments are made for that. And lastly, partners are asked to promote full participation in the Census among their members, through newsletters, e-mails, local meetings etc. Again, there's no payment for that. So let's count the ways Bachmann is wrong: ACORN will not be in charge of going door-to-door and collecting data from the American public, as Bachmann said. The U.S. Census will be in charge of that. Some of the 1.4 million people who get Census-taking jobs may learn about the job through ACORN. Workers who apply to the Census through ACORN have no better shot at the job than those who apply through any of the 30,000 other partners. That's it. And despite Bachmann's claim, ACORN gets no money for signing on as a partner. Once again, she is making a scaremongering claim about ACORN with facts that are ridiculously wrong. So we have to set the meter on fire once again. She earns another Pants on Fire.",0.1,0.9,0.7,0.975781047

Bernie Sanders single-payer health care plan, Republicans took to social media to tout the reports most eye-popping finding. Sanders Medicare for All would cost $32.6 trillion over 10 years, an amount they framed as crushingly large. $32.6 trillion dollars. Thats how much Washington Democrats single-payer healthcare proposal would cost over 10 years. Even doubling all federal individual and corporate income taxes wouldnt cover this cost. It is just absurd. https://t.co/8jijG73wEw Sanders, however, found good news for his idea in the generally skeptical report. In a video he shared on social media July 30, he pointed out one of the reports findings that others had overlooked. Sanders tweaked the Koch brothers, the conservative donor family that has supported the Mercatus Center at George Mason University in Virginia. Sanders said, Let me thank the Koch Brothers of all people for sponsoring a study that shows that Medicare for All would save the American people $2 trillion over a 10-year period.  That is what is in the study of the Mercatus Center. Thank you, Koch brothers, for accidentally making the case for Medicare for All! pic.twitter.com/speuEL6ETC Sanders plan would essentially expand Medicare to cover everyone, rather than just those older than 65. Individuals (and their employers) would no longer need to shoulder co-pays for medical care or premiums for private insurance coverage. Instead, the government would pay everyones medical bills. Sanders and his allies say this would end up saving money, because it would remove the middle-man of insurance companies, which drive up administrative costs, and and enable the government to use new bargaining power to rein in costs by providers. Skeptics counter that those savings are not guaranteed, and the lack of a monetary incentive for patients to hold back on services could lead to increased use of the system, adding to the overall cost. In addition, with the government having to raise revenue to pay everyones bills, taxes and the federal debt could go dangerously high, potentially canceling out or exceeding the money that individuals and families would save in higher take-home pay and lower health-care expenses. In this article, well look at something much more narrow: whether Sanders is right that the Mercatus report says that single-payer would save the United States $2 trillion in health care outlays. In a way, Sanders is right, though his assertion glosses over some caveats. The Mercatus report included a table summarizing the financial effects of Sanders bill. With a minimum of arithmetic, its not hard to find the $2 trillion in question. Its the difference between the Department of Health and Human Services projection of the amount of total health care spending in the United States, and what Mercatus thinks that number would be under Sanders Medicare for All proposal. (See Table 2.) Under Mercatus projection for Medicare for All, the total amount of health expenditures would actually fall compared to what is expected under a continuation of the current system. Specifically, total health care expenditures would fall by $2.054 trillion over 10 years, according to Mercatus. So theres definitely something to what Sanders said. The Mercatus reports author took issue with Sanders focus on that figure. Charles Blahous said that to come up with that estimate, Mercatus used a relatively generous assumption about how well Sanders plan will end up controlling health care costs. It assumes that provider payment will be reduced to Medicare levels, that negotiation with prescription drugmakers will generate significant savings, and that administrative costs will be cut from 13 to 6 percent. However, in an alternative scenario in which cost-control works less effectively (see Table 4) Mercatus found that over the same 10-year period, national health expenditures would actually increase by $3.252 trillion compared to current law. So while the number Sanders chose really does appear in the report, hes cherry-picked the more flattering of two estimates. Sanders bill indicates that health providers would be paid at Medicares payment rates, which are about 40 percent lower than those paid by private insurance, Blahous said. Obviously, immediately cutting payments to health care providers by roughly 40 percent would lower national health spending. But would cuts that large actually occur (and without other negative consequences, such as mass retirements of doctors unwilling to accept lower fees)? This is where independent experts express caution. Sustained cuts as deep as those projected in the Mercatus model Sanders pointed to are not likely feasible, said John Holahan, a fellow in the health policy center at the Urban Institute. His Urban Institute colleague, Linda Blumberg, agreed, saying its a pretty heroic assumption to say that you can dial payment rates down to those levels system-wide politically. In addition, even if the switch to Medicare for All does end up cutting the total amount of money spent on health care in the United States, the legislation places more of those costs on the federal budget. In an era of rising debt and an aging Baby Boom generation, that could be a problem. Josh Miller-Lewis, a spokesman for Sanders, focused instead on the impact on individuals, many of whom will end up ahead. Under Medicare for All with a progressive tax system, the vast majority of people will save money on health care, he said. In cheekily thanking the Koch brothers, Sanders said a study they indirectly sponsored shows that Medicare for All would save the American people $2 trillion over a 10-year period. The $2 trillion figure can be traced back to the Mercatus report. But it is one of two scenarios the report offers, so Sanders use of the term would is too strong. The alternative figure, which assumes that a Medicare for All plan isnt as successful in controlling costs as its sponsors hope it will be, would lead to an increase of almost $3.3 trillion in national health care expenditures, not a decline. Independent experts say the alternative scenario of weaker cost control is at least as plausible.",0.7,0.3,0.9,0.7310685255

I mean a high percentage of our kids take the SAT.,"As CNBC pronounced Texas the nation's best state for doing business, Gov. Rick Perry offered reasons why Texas is still on top during an interview with the business-news network. One of them: the number of Texas students participating in a national college-admissions' exam. We have more kids take the SAT than any other state in the nation, Perry said on the July 13 CNBC broadcast. I mean a high percentage of our kids take the SAT. Which is it? Bill White, the Democratic nominee for governor who has stressed education as an important issue, thinks it's neither. Rick Perry proved again yesterday that he simply can't tell the truth when it comes to education, a July 14 press release from White chided, saying that Perry gave blatantly false information about SATs. Later that day, the governor's office issued a press release pointing reporters to a July 14 Fortune magazine article that offered four reasons why Texas beats California in a recession. However, the article also notes that SAT scores in the state have declined over the last few years, and the state ranked 34th among the 52 states and jurisdictions graded on the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) last year. Confused? When we checked with Perry's campaign, spokeswoman Catherine Frazier tweaked the first of Perry's CNBC statements by saying Texas has more students taking the SAT than nearly any other state. According to the College Board, which manages the SAT exams, Texas ranked third in 2009 in the number of SAT takers — 141,733 public and private school students. Of course, Texas was also the second-most populous state. California, the most populous state, had the most SAT participants (207,301), followed by New York (159,886). We turned next to Perry's second statement, that a high percentage of our kids take the SAT — arguably a powerful talking point because a state's percentage of SAT takers signifies its share of potential college students. According to the College Board in 2009, Texas had the 22nd highest SAT participation rate (21st if you don't count the District of Columbia): 51 percent of Texas students in the class of 2009. The national average was 46 percent. Maine had the highest participation rate (90 percent), followed by New York, Massachusetts, Connecticut and D.C. In recent years, neither the percentage of SAT-takers in Texas nor the state's place in the College Board rankings has changed much. In 2008, Texas again came in 22nd, with 50 percent of students taking the test. In fact, as long as Perry has been governor, Texas has ranked 20th, 21st or 22nd. Its share of students taking the test has ranged from a high of 57 percent (2003) to, most recently, a low of 51 percent. So how does the governor's two-part statement score? We'll cut him slack for saying Texas has the most students taking the SAT, since he immediately backed off when questioned. And Texas did have the third-highest number of high-school students who took the SAT in 2009. Perry's statement that Texas has a high percentage of students taking the SAT begs the question: High compared to what? While the share of Texas students who took the test in 2009 exceeded the national average, 20 other states had greater shares of students taking the test including similarly high-population states such as Florida, Pennsylvania and New York. California had a smaller share: 49 percent. We figure high means better than barely above average. To stick with the school metaphor, 51 percent is a failing grade. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.",0.5,0.6,0.8,0.3522815367

Rick Scott says he wants to put money back in taxpayers pockets. He touts a property tax cut he got in 2011 (in reality, a smidgen), a pay hike for teachers in 2013 and now his proposal to cut $500 million in taxes or fees. Scott hasnt released specifics on his next tax cuts, but his overall message is clear: He wants voters to see him as the guy in their corner saving them money. Former Democratic state Sen. Nan Rich who is running against Scott, calls his idea a re-election gimmick in light of Floridas pressing needs -- including education. We need to be taking a long hard look at funding the critical needs of the state, she said Sept. 11. Were 48th in K-12 funding and 50th in higher education. Rich said more funding for education would be a better way to help the middle class. Florida has often gotten a bad rap for education spending -- but just how bottom of the barrel are we? PolitiFact Florida examined the states K-12 education funding ranking in 2010, but we wanted to see if the numbers had changed and if Rich had done her homework. K-12 funding There are lots of different ways to compare funding for K-12 or higher education. How Florida ranks depends on many factors such as whether the cost-of-living in various states is taken into account. Some analyses focus on state money while others also factor in local dollars. Not surprisingly, depending on the methodology, we found different numbers for Floridas ranking. But most were in the bottom of the pack. Rich directed us to the U.S. Census Bureauwhich shows Florida ranked 42nd in per-pupil funding at $10,031, taking into account federal, state and local sources, or 48th for state funding alone at $3,440 in 2011. Rich had cited that 48th figure. We found many other entities that provide state comparisons on education funding in a variety of ways including the National Education Association, Education Week and the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) which is part of the U.S. Department of Education. NCES, for example, shows that Florida spent $9,030 per pupil in 2011, ahead of 13 other states. (This chart combines funding so its not a measurement of only state spending.) Why the different ranking between the NCES report and the census report that Rich referenced? NCES includes charter schools, while the census generally doesnt, said Mark Dixon, project manager for the annual survey of school system finances for the census. Higher education funding Rich didnt direct us to a source of data for her claim about Florida ranking 50th in higher education. But much like K-12 funding comparisons, we found that different methodologies produced different rankings for Florida. The NEA ranked Florida 50th on per capita state and local government expenditures for higher education for the 2009-10 school year. The amount spent per capita was $485 -- just one buck lower than Nevada and ahead of the District of Columbia. We found more recent data through Grapevine, a longstanding annual report by Illinois State University. About half the states fund higher education in part through local funds, but the Grapevine report only shows state money. That report doesnt provide rankings but compares the states per capita, which refers to the states overall population. That analysis shows Florida at $172.98 per capita. By our count, that placed Florida ahead of eight states in 2013. I try to avoid rankings, said Jim Palmer, a professor and editor of Grapevine. Youve got 50 different state systems ... you have to wonder what the rankings really mean. If one state ranks lower than another does that mean the higher education system is not as good? I cant make that judgment. We were surprised to find Florida gave more money per capita than Massachusetts and asked Palmer to elaborate. The history of education in Massachusetts is not as reliant on the public sector as it has been in Florida. The private sector looms large in Massachusetts going back to Harvard. ... Florida devoted itself to developing a strong community college system -- stronger than New England. Palmer directed us to the State Higher Education Executive Officers, a group that publishes a report using Grapevine'sstate data along with other sources of funds, including local dollars and stimulus money. It also takes into account factors such as cost-of-living. That report showed Florida at $5,130 -- ahead of about 20 states. Our ruling Rich said, Were 48th in K-12 funding and 50th in higher education. There are lots of different valid ways to measure education funding. One way is to compare how much money a state provides for education per pupil,and by that measure Florida ranked 48th according to the Census. Thats a valid way to look at the numbers because it was in the context of Rich criticizing the governor who signs the state budget. However, its one of several ways to measure school spending. For higher education spending, the National Education Association ranked Florida 50th for state and local expenditures in 2009-10. But other more recent analysis we reviewed showed Florida higher than 50th. One measure showed Florida ahead of about 20 states.",0.7,0.3,1,0.2452439018

Finland, which is the envy of all public school systems in the world, has one. Thats right, one.We're not going to judge the merits of educational systems. But we have experience counting tests.Yet, as we tucked into this Massachusetts-Finland shout, we noticed Ratliffs article does not say if hes critical of every exam given under the State of Texas Assessments of Academic Readiness system. That testing starts in the third grade.By phone, Ratliff told us that he was thinking only of the state's 11 to 15 newly-installed end-of-course exams that high-school students must hurdle to qualify for graduation.So, what of Massachusetts and Finland?Ratliff said he drew his Massachusetts test count from Austin lawyer Dineen Majcher, who helped launch Texans Advocating for Meaningful Student Assessment amid concerns the 2009 Legislature's overhaul of student testing and accountability went overboard.Majcher pointed us to a Massachusetts government web page, for the Bay States Department of Elementary and Secondary Education, indicating that high-school students should attain proficient scores on tests in English language arts and math and a test in any of several science-oriented subjects: biology, chemistry, introductory physics or technology/engineering. Students who do not meet the states proficient score on either test can still graduate, according to the agency, by fulfilling an educational proficiency plan entailing more classwork and testing.By email, department spokesman J.C. Considine told us that outside of the states high-school tests, students in grades three through eight must take standardized state exams. According to an agency web page, results are used to hold schools accountable for progress toward the federal goal that all U.S. students be proficient in reading and math by 2014.Now lets flip to Finland.Ratliff pointed us to an article in the September 2011 issue of Smithsonian, the magazine produced by the Smithsonian Institution, saying that students there have outperformed counterparts in other countries thanks to in a focus on well-prepared teachers who decide how best to school their individual pupils. The story also says there are no mandated standardized tests in Finland, apart from one exam at the end of students senior year in high school.The test is the Finnish Matriculation Exam, according to a Finnish government web page, which says the exams purpose is to discover whether pupils have assimilated the knowledge and skills required by the curriculum for the upper secondary school and whether they have reached an adequate level of maturity in line with that school`s goals. Passing the Matriculation Examination entitles the candidate to continue his or her studies at university.According to the web page, the exam is given each spring and fall.However, the exam is not a one-and-done. Its composed of at least four tests, one that each student must take in his or her mother tongue—Finnish, Swedish or Saami—and three others at their choice either on the second national language or a foreign language; math; or a test in the sciences and humanities, according to the web page, including tests in Evangelical Lutheran religion, Orthodox religion, ethics, philosophy, psychology, history, social studies, physics, chemistry, biology, geography and health education.As part of his or her examination, the candidate may additionally include one or more optional tests, the web page says.Whoa. Could each student really take more than 10 tests?Pasi Sahlberg, a Finnish expert in education and director general of the Helsinki-based Centre for International Mobility and Cooperation, confirmed by email that the overall standardized exam consists of a minimum of four tests, but students if they wish can take more exams. Typically, he said, students take five or six tests. These may be spread over a 12-month period, he said, though most students take most of their tests in the spring of their last school year. Notably, too, Sahlberg emailed, Finnish students who focus on vocational training after completing the countrys nine mandatory years of basic education do not have to take a state-mandated exam of any kind. In 2010, 45 percent of the students who continued their schooling after the nine years chose the vocational track, Satu Mäki-Lassila of Finlands Ministry of Education and Culture told us by email.Our rulingRatliff wrote that Massachusetts has three mandated student tests and Finland one.Both claims reflect the exams that students in Massachusetts and Finland have to take to qualify for high school graduation.But students on the academic track in Finland must take at least four separate tests. Also, given that Ratliffs article does not say hes speaking only to tests administered in high school, its worth noting that Massachusetts, like Texas, requires students starting in third grade to take state tests.This claim grades out as Half True. CLARIFICATION, 10:00 a.m., Dec. 19, 2012: We amended this article to point out that Finnish students who focus on vocational courses at the secondary level do not have to take a government-mandated exam to graduate.

Republican Richard Hudson spoke about immigration with Fox News in a segment posted online March 15. The reason were having this Biden border surge is because hes reversed these policies, as you say. He stopped building the wall. He put a halt on deportations and he brought back catch and release, he said. He later tweeted those same talking points. Democrats are trying to shift blame but make no mistake - this is the #BidenBorderCrisis. The facts back it up: illegal border crossings are up 173% from 1 year ago and 28% since January when President Biden stopped the wall & deportations and started catch & release, he said. While Hudsons stats arent exactly right, he has a point about illegal border crossing numbers increasing significantly since last year and even since January. As for whats causing the situation at the border, experts say his description is off. Border crossing numbers are available at the U.S. Customs and Border Protections website. When the webpage opens, a chart will appear showing data that combines two types of encounters: those recorded by Border Patrol, and those recorded by the Office of Field Operations. Whats the difference? The field office deals with people who showed up at an official port of entry in an attempt to legally enter and were turned away. Meanwhile, Border Patrol data includes people who attempted to enter the country without going through the legal process. If you combine the two pools of data, the total number of encounters this February is 173% higher than it was last February. This is likely where Hudsons figure comes from. The agency reported a total of 100,441 encounters in February, up from 36,687 last February. However, to focus on illegal border crossings, its more effective to omit field office encounters and focus on Border Patrol data. If we just look at encounters with Border Patrol, they triple from 30,077 last February to 96,974 this February. Thats an increase of 222%. One thing to note is that the agency tracks crossings — not people, meaning some of the documented crossings could be from the same person. In fact, the agency estimated that between last March and this February 38% of all encounters involved recidivism, or individuals who have been apprehended more than once. As for month-to-month numbers, encounters rose roughly 28% with or without field office data. In summary, Hudson is right in that the rise in illegal crossings was likely 173% — at least. He looked at the wrong numbers but the miss doesnt undermine his point. Now lets look at what Hudson claims is the reason for the rise. PolitiFact NC interviewed four experts who each said Hudson inaccurately described Bidens policies and overlooked the myriad of reasons for the situation at the border, which PolitiFact wrote about earlier this month. Does the wall have anything to do with the current problem at the border? Experts say no. The wall was not a factor at all, said David Bier, an immigration expert at the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank. It has no effect on whether people cross the border — only on where they cross. No more walls are being built right now. But it does not matter, said Tony Payan, director of the Center for the United States and Mexico at Rice Universitys Baker Institute for Public Policy. The wall has no practicable effect on crossborder irregular migrant traffic or drug smuggling for that matter, Payan said. Its true that Biden has halted construction of the wall along the southern border. However, its wrong to suggest that further construction would have made a difference. As PolitiFact has previously reported, former President Donald Trump replaced roughly 200 miles of existing border fencing over four years but erected only a few miles of new border wall. It is not as if continued construction of border walls and fences would have hermetically sealed the border tomorrow, said Lynn Marcus, director of Arizona Universitys Community Immigration Law Placement Clinic. New segments of the wall take years to build, said Nicole Hallett, director of the Immigrants Rights Clinic at the University of Chicago Law School. The amount of wall that would have been built between January and now is negligible and would have practically no effect on how many people are crossing the border. Now to the last part of Hudsons tweet. Did Biden stop deportations? And is that part of the reason for the rise in border crossings? This is a gross mischaracterization. When Biden took office, his administration ordered a 100-day pause on the deportation of people with final orders of removal. However, that pause didnt apply to people who posed a threat to national security, who were convicted of a felony, or who were incarcerated at the time of the memo. And a federal judge later blocked Bidens move. Biden also started allowing some asylum-seekers back into the country. That rule-change is expected to affect 25,000 asylum cases, according to a PolitiFact story from mid-February. In the meantime, federal law allows border officials to turn people away because of the public health emergency. This law is referred to as Title 42. Out of the roughly 96,000 migrants encountered by Border Patrol in February, more than 70,000 were turned away because of this rule. Bottom line: Deportations have not stopped. What about a supposed catch and release policy? Trump and other conservatives have used this term derogatorily over the years, sometimes referring to any rule that allows an immigrant to walk free. However, this Obama-era rule specifically allows asylum seekers to remain in the U.S. while awaiting court dates. (PolitiFact went over the rule in a recent fact check of the Texas governor.) The Trump administration tried to ban catch and release in 2018. Biden lifted Trump's edict in early February, with the border patrol agency citing housing limitations as part of the reason why. Per longstanding practice, when long-term holding solutions arent possible, some migrants will be processed for removal, provided a Notice to Appear, and released into the U.S. to await a future immigration hearing, an agency spokesman told Yahoo News. Experts dismissed the idea that catch and release has much to do with the rise in border crossings. Biden hasnt changed catch and release policy in any meaningful way from Jan. 20, said Bier, the Cato expert. More people are being released only because Mexico is refusing to take more than a certain number back. But he is removing far more and releasing far fewer migrants than Trump in the 2019 wave. When we asked Hudson for the source of his information, his office cited four news articles about immigrants who said they expected Bidens administration to grant them entry. Spokesman Greg Steele said Bidens administration is clearly contributing to migrants surging to the border. Experts told PolitiFact theyre not surprised some migrants cite Biden as a reason for their reason for crossing the border, either because theyre overly optimistic or because theyre misinformed. No doubt, human smugglers take advantage of people's desperation by promising that, with the change in administrations, the U.S. will now welcome them with open arms, Marcus said. While such messages may give hope to some who incur substantial debt to undertake the dangerous journey to the U.S. border, they are not the main reason people leave, nor are they based on fact. The four experts who emailed with PolitiFact NC about the situation said there are multiple reasons for the rise in border crossings. The number of migrants are on the rise, said Payan, the Rice University expert. But, interestingly, they are showing the same pattern — they rise in the spring and summer and fall in the fall and winter. They have cited warming weather, political instability in immigrants home countries, hurricanes that hit Central America last year, and the economic fallout from the coronavirus pandemic. They also said Trumps attempts to reject people seeking asylum, attempts that were challenged in the courts, created a logjam. The U.S. Customs and Border Protection agency mentioned some of these causes in a Feb. 10 press release. A Washington Post analysis found that the rise in migrants at the border follows a seasonal pattern set in fiscal year 2019, with the addition of pent-up demand from people who stayed home in 2020 because of the pandemic. Hallett, the expert at the University of Chicago, pointed out that border crossings still havent reached the level they were in spring 2019, when there were 100,000 crossings per month for four months straight. That would suggest that something independent of U.S. policy is at least partly responsible for the increase, she said. Hudson said Illegal border crossings are up 173% from 1 year ago and 28% since January when President Biden stopped the wall & deportations and started catch & release. Hudsons numbers are slightly off, but his point about illegal crossings rising nearly 200% is accurate. However, experts say the reasons for the rise in border crossings are complex and not fairly summarized by pinning the blame on border wall construction and Bidens deportation policies.

Standing a few feet behind him and in front of millions of television viewers, Pelosi tore up a copy of Trumps 2020 State of the Union speech seconds after he finished giving the address. But despite an image you might have seen shared on Facebook, the California Democrat did not issue a tweet saying she was disgusted with Trump over taxes. The tweet attributed to her reads: I am disgusted with President Trump allowing people to keep more of the money they earn. It is this type of wide spread theft of public resources that keeps America from being great Mr. President. The image was flagged as part of Facebooks efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The supposed tweet is dated Dec. 20, 2017. Thats the day Congress passed a $1.5 trillion tax cut bill that Trump signed into law a few days later. Pelosi opposed the measure and Democrats criticized it as favoring the rich. While the blue-checked Twitter handle that appears in the image (@NancyPelosi) might seem legitimate, her actual Twitter account handle is @SpeakerPelosi. Whats more, she uses a different photo for her Twitter account than the one we see in this Facebook image. A Pelosi spokesman called the supposed tweet fiction. Hes right. It was outed as fake long ago. Snopes, in December 2017, and FactCheck.org, in October 2018, reported that the tweet was a fake, posted by Tweeterino, a fake-tweet generator that shut itself down in June 2018.

John Kitzhaber recently announced the creation of a new commission to examine the states sentencing laws. Not long after, two advocacy groups released a joint report calling Oregon's Measure 11 ineffective and discriminatory when it comes to the states youth.Mandatory sentencing laws -- ever the point of contention -- are receiving renewed public attention. And in a recent guest column in The Oregonian, three county district attorneys -- including Multnomahs Michael Schrunk -- offered some context, noting this is an issue with which we have great experience and expertise.While expressing some disappointment that the governor was not including elected district attorneys on the commission, the three wrote contrary to popular belief, we do not lock up every convicted criminal. Under our current sentencing laws, about 75 percent of all convicted felons in Oregon do not go to prison. They are put on probation in the community.That statistic caught the eye of at least one reader who asked PolitiFact Oregon to take a look.The DAs said they got that figure courtesy of Oregons Criminal Justice Commission, so thats where we started.It didnt take long before Michael Wilson, the commissions economist, sent us a breakdown of felons and their sentences for 2010.At first blush, it looks like Schrunk and the other DAs -- John Foote of Clackamas and Bob Hermann of Washington -- were right. (It should be noted, nine others endorsed the letter, as well.) Of the 17,622 convicted felons in 2010, just over 4,000 were sent to prison. As a percentage, thats about 23 percent.But, as Craig Prins, the director of the justice commission put it, the simple answer isnt always the most informative answer. There are a few caveats to consider before you go shouting that number from any rooftops.For starters, that 23 percent figure doesnt include the 8 percent of felons who serve state time, but do it in local jails. Those 8 percent serve less than a year, but its still worth noting. Take that into account and at least 30 percent are serving state time -- just not necessarily in a prison.Next, it should be noted that there are different categories of felonies, and as you drill down into them, you start to notice that certain sorts of felons are more likely to receive time in a prison.Of the felons convicted of person crimes (think: robberies, assaults, sex crimes, murder and others), 43 percent go to prison, and another 3 percent spent time in a local jail. For felons convicted of property crimes, 30 percent wind up in prison and another 5 percent in local jails.The overall figure gets pushed down some by drug offenders who are sentenced to prison at a rate close to 8 percent with another 10 percent going to local jails for less than a year. The national rate for the same group is considerably higher, Prins said. In 2006, for instance, nationally drug offenders were being sent to prison about 40 percent of the time, according to a report from the Bureau of Justice Statistics.In Oregon, weve always kind of prided ourselves on the fact that, policy-wise, it does not make sense to put such people in prison, Prins said. Same goes for people who commit lower-level property crimes. Is it worth spending $30,000 to incarcerate somebody who stole $1,000? Prins asked. The priority are those who commit violent crimes.And, indeed, if you exclude drug offenders from the equation, 33 percent of convicted felons serve time in prison while 7 percent serve time in local jails for a total closer to 40 percent.Thats not to say that drug offenses arent felonies -- but its still important context, especially given that the word felony can describe a number of crimes.Theres one last bit to consider: About 69 percent of all convicted felons wind up with probation. But that doesnt mean they get off without serving any time behind bars, which seems to be an implicit part of the DAs critique when they note contrary to popular belief, we do not lock up every convicted criminal.According to Wilson, about 63 percent of the offenders who received a probation sentence in 2010 received a jail sentence as well. The average stay, he said, was just over a month.Put another way, only 25 percent of convicted felons actually manage to avoid time behind bars as part of their sentence. Even then, Charles French, a deputy district attorney with Multnomah County who deals a lot with crime statistics, said hed be surprised if those 25 percent dont serve at least some time in jail, if even a night, after their arrest.I think most people who commit felonies do serve time in jail, he said. But most of them do not serve time in prison. And, frankly, the idea of a jail sanction as a condition of probation is reformatory, in theory.Its important, he added, that the public has access to these sorts of figures, even if they require some context. I think the more information the public has, the better.As for our ruling, the DAs were very specific in their statement that 75 percent of all convicted felons in Oregon do not go to prison. Technically theyre right, but the number of felons the DAs lock up is considerable higher and thats an important piece of missing context.

Tackling gun violence was among the issues at the top of Cavalier Johnson'spriority list in his successful bid to win the Milwaukee mayors office. Days after his historic win, Johnson had this to say April 9, 2022, on PBS Wisconsins Here & Now show, telling anchor Frederica Freyberg: Unfortunately, at the local level, we dont control gun law. We just react to it. In one of the more recent years in Milwaukee, our police department collected more guns per capita off the streets than in New York. That caught our attention, given the vast difference in size —and reputations —between the two cities. Is Johnson right? Lets start with gun recoveries by the Milwaukee Police Department, a number that has been on the rise in recent years. 2015: 2,504 guns recovered 2016: 2,421 2017: 2,753 2018: 2,908 2019: 2,621 2020: 3,097 2021: 3,279 As of April 20, 2022, the police department had recovered 927 guns —compared with the 681 reported at about the same time the year before. To be sure, a per-capita approach is the best way to compare Milwaukee and New York City, which is approximately 10 times larger. In this case, though, Johnson was pretty vague in declaring the city led in one of the more recent years. Which year? When asked for backup, Johnsons staff pointed to 2016 and provided two articles —one published by the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, the other by Wiscontext, which is part of PBS Wisconsin. Both articles reported that Milwaukee had a higher gun recovery per capita versus some of the countrys largest metropolitan cities. In 2016, the 2,421 guns recovered by Milwaukee police translated into a rate of 406.84 guns per 100,000 people, according to the Journal Sentinel article. That same year, New York City reported 3,583 gun recoveries, which translated into about 42 per 100,000 people, according to a 2017 report issued by the city of Chicago. The numbers do not include any guns obtained through turn-in or buyback programs. The city of Chicago report was comparing its experience withthat of other large cities, and was largely aimed at determining where guns used in crimes come from. In any case, that means the rate in Milwaukee, in that year, was 10 times that of New York. Milwaukee even surpassed two other major U.S. cities featured in the report: Chicago and Los Angeles. In 2016, Chicago counted 6,644 gun recoveries, with a rate of 244 per 100,000 people, while Los Angeles had 5,908 gun recoveries in the same year, with 149 per 100,000. Many factorsgo into gun recoveries, including more aggressive policing, special patrols and initiatives and the like. But Johnson made a narrow, focused claim, and on it hit the mark. Indeed, as the Journal Sentinel article noted, Milwaukee police routinely recover guns at a higher rate than many other major cities —so, truly, Johnson probably would have been safe even if he had been more expansive in making his point. Johnson claimed that in a recent year, the Milwaukee Police Department collected more guns per capita off the streets than in New York. Although the time frame Johnson referredto was vague, the claim was on point, as Milwaukees gun recoveries per capita numbers in 2016 were more than 10 times higher than what New York City reported for that year.",1,0,1,0.5403075902

The media has not reported that the National Debt in my first month went down by $12 billion vs a $200 billion increase in Obama first mo., Trump posted on Twitter Feb. 25, 2017. The media has not reported that the National Debt in my first month went down by $12 billion vs a $200 billion increase in Obama first mo. The tweet mirrors an article posted on the Gateway Pundit website a few days earlier. It was repeated by conservative pundit Herman Cain on Fox News shortly before Trumps tweet. On January 20th, the day of the Trump Inauguration, the US Debt stood at $19,947 billion, the Gateway Pundit website reads. On February 21st, a month later, the US Debt load stood at $19,935 billion. Trump cut the US Debt burden by $12 billion and 0.1% in his first month in office! The numbers check out. And in fact, the total public debt has dropped another $22 billion since the Gateway Pundit article published, according to data from the U.S. Department of Treasury. But, experts say, people shouldnt read much into the numbers. Nor should Trump be popping champagne. Considering that Trump hasnt enacted any fiscal legislation, its a bit of a stretch for him to take credit for any changes in debt levels, Dan Mitchell, a libertarian economist and senior fellow at the Cato Institute, told us. Debt levels go up and down in the short run based on independent factors such as quarterly tax payments and predetermined expenditure patterns, he said. The White House did not respond to our query for this fact-check. Looking at the debt numbers Trump and the Gateway Pundit are examining the total public debt outstanding, which is nearing $20 trillion. Experts said another figure to focus on is debts held by the public, which is the amount of money the United States government owes someone else. On Jan. 20, when Trump took office, the debt held by the public sat at $14.4 trillion. That figure fluctuated up and down a bit, but as of Feb. 22, it remained $14.4 trillion. On Feb. 23, the debt held by the public figure dropped to $14.38 trillion. Heres a chart that shows debt figures on selected days since Trump took office.

But experts say its likely to shoot back up any day. I wonder what he thinks he did to bring this about, said Harvard University government professor Jeffrey Frankel. This one-month number is trivial in the long-run trend. The national debt will rise this year, and in future years. It will rise at a sharply accelerated rate if Trump carries out even half of his campaign promises for specific tax cuts (and specific spending increases). Will he be willing to be judged by the debt numbers in the future? Dean Baker, an economist with the liberal Center for Economic and Policy Research, said the temporary dip in the debt is triggered by the timing of tax payments and government spending, both matters that he has not affected one iota. AddedNeil Buchanan, a George Washington University law professor and author of The Debt Ceiling Disasters:No one who knows anything about budgeting would take a 30-day change to have any meaning at all.There is no credit to take, because it's like noticing that rainfall numbers from one month to the next are not exactly the same or that attendance at baseball games is not a constant number. Donald Marron, Director of Economic Policy Initiatives at the Urban Institute,speculated that the drop in debt may be because President Barack Obamas administration left Trump with cash on hand to run the government. So the government's need to borrow hasn't been high recently. On Jan. 20, the day Trump took office, the federal government had a cash operating balance of $382 billion, according to the Treasury Department. By Feb. 22, the cash balance had dropped to $228 billion. Our ruling Trump tweeted, The National Debt in my first month went down by $12 billion. Trump would be wise to not read too much into this figure, which sounds more noteworthy than it actually is. The national debt fluctuates up and down depending on the day. While the debt is down after one month, experts say that trend will reverse and the debt will continue to rise. This factoid is a gross misrepresentation of the state of the debt and the role the new president had in shaping the figure. Update: This post has been updated to include comments from Neil Buchanan and to include Donald Marron's current title. ",0.7,0.7,0.9,0.02799878005

Hillary Clinton during the April 16 Democratic debate ruled out meeting with Iran's President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. As she criticized the Bush administration for failing to deter Iran from pursuing its nuclear program, Clinton said Ahmadinejad's most recent inflammatory remarks would make it impossible for her to speak with him directly. I certainly would not meet with Ahmadinejad because even again today he made light of 9/11, and said that he's not even sure it happened and that people actually died, Clinton said. Ahmadinejad, who has a history of provocative statements on such things, including saying the Holocaust was a fake, did indeed, question the U.S. version of the events of 9/11 on three occasions in just over a week. He said U.S. claims about being attacked were a pretext for military action against Iraq and Afghanistan. Four or five years ago a suspect event took place in New York, Ahmadinejad said in an April 16 speech in the holy city of Qom that was broadcast live on state television, according to Agence France Presse. A building collapsed and they said that 3,000 people had been killed, whose names were never published. Under this pretext they (the United States) attacked Afghanistan and Iraq and since then a million people have been killed. Ahmadinejad first expressed his doubts about the attacks on April 8 at a ceremony in the holy city of Qom celebrating Iran's nuclear program, which U.S. officials worry could be used to make weapons. He questioned how aircraft could have evaded radar and intelligence and crashed into the twin towers undetected. Ahmadinejad repeated his doubts the next day at a speech at a Shiite holy shrine in the city of Mashhad, according to press accounts. Iran condemned the attacks soon after they occurred. The government at the time was headed by moderate President Mohammad Khatami. Ahmadeinejad has been given to bellicose pronouncement in the past and provoked a global outcry when he described the Holocaust as a myth. During his controversial visit to the United States in September 2007, Ahmadinejad, when asked about the death penalty Iran imposed on homosexuals, denied there were homosexuals in Iran. He has repeatedly called for Israel's destruction. On Wednesday, he reaffirmed his intention to change the international order, Agence France Presse reported. We have two missions, Ahmadinejad proclaimed. To construct Iran and change the global situation. It is impossible to reach the summits of progress without changing the corrupt and unjust order of the world. Tehran insists its nuclear program is peaceful and intended to expand energy supplies for a growing population. The statement may be startling, but it's true. Clinton accurately summarized Ahmadeinejad's recent comments about 9/11. We judge her statement to be True. ",1,0,1,0.7892539572

John Kasich has made it clear his top priority while in office is to bring jobs to Ohio and turn the economy around.JobsOhio, a publicly funded, private nonprofit corporation, is Kasichs big idea to attract businesses here and create jobs. The nonprofit corporation will act as a privatized version of the Department of Developments economic development efforts. Yet the transition of this public agency, which Kasich has described as sluggish and ineffective, to the private sector has raised concerns about transparency and accountability.Kasich, a Republican, wants JobsOhio to be exempt from Ohios public records and open meetings laws. The corporation would be audited annually to show the public its spending. But Democrats have loudly criticized the exemptions, saying they would keep the corporations operations under wraps and out of the public view, inviting scandal and a misuse of taxpayers dollars. Kasich and other Republicans say the exemptions are needed to help JobsOhio move at the speed of business. Public disclosure could disrupt business negotiations, they argue.State Rep. Matt Lundy, a Democrat from Elyria, is not convinced JobsOhio needs to be shielded from public records laws, and he has introduced legislation to subject the corporation to those rules.There is nothing in the current state public records law that prohibits sensitive or confidential business information from being just that, confidential, Lundy said in a Feb. 7 news release announcing his legislation, which he called the Taxpayers Right to Know Act.Republicans control the Ohio House of Representatives, so Lundys bill is unlikely to get much attention. But since his effort highlights ongoing concerns about JobsOhio, PolitiFact Ohio decided to check out Lundys claim and examine how Ohios public records laws treat the states interactions with outside businesses.Ohios public records law, section 149.43 of Ohio Revised Code, establishes the public availability of records kept by public offices, whether its a city hall or local school district or the governor. The law also includes numerous exceptions, which range from a police officers home address to adoption records.These exceptions also apply to certain business records.Sensitive business records often fall within the trade secrets exception to Ohios public records law, said David Marburger, an attorney for Baker Hostetler in Cleveland and counsel for the Ohio Coalition for Open Government. Marburger, who often represents The Plain Dealer on issues of public access to government, called the trade secrets exception extremely broad.Ohio Revised Code section 1333.61 defines a trade secret as any information, including business information, financial information, technical information, formulas, names addresses and telephone numbers, of actual or potential economic value.Marburger said the trade secret exception is a nearly impenetrable shield when a government entity and a business share sensitive or confidential information.Kent State University School of Journalism and Mass Communication professor Tim Smith agreed. He also cited the trade secrets exception when asked about Lundys statement. From my knowledge about the open records law, Lundys statement is accurate, said Smith, a former managing editor for the Akron Beacon Journal.Kasichs administration and Republicans in the House of Representatives, which already has approved the JobsOhio plan, have offered a cross-section of scenarios in which public disclosure would impede JobsOhios mission. (The Republican-controlled Ohio Senate is still reviewing the plan.) For example, if communication between JobsOhio and a sought-after company was public record, another states could use that information to trump Ohios offer.PolitiFact Ohio is not rating whether JobsOhio should be exempted from public records laws. Regardless of the advantages or disadvantages, Lundys statement that Ohios public records law includes exceptions that protect sensitive and confidential business information is correct.On the Truth-O-Meter it earns a rating of True.",1,0,1,0.08860562726

One about birth control. His campaign pointed us to criticism from theU.S. Conference of Catholic Bishopsof a Jan. 20 decision that ordered almost every employer and insurer in the country to provide sterilization and contraceptives, including some abortion-inducing drugs, in their health plans, according to the group.The bishops said almost every employer and insurer.We wondered, was Gingrich right that the Obama administration would impose on every Catholic institution, every Jewish institution, every Protestant institution the Obamacare standard of what you have to buy as insurance?'The Obamacare standard'The rule Gingrich was talking about, announced by Health and Human Services Department Secretary Kathleen Sebelius, addressed which preventive services must be covered by insurers without a co-pay, co-insurance or a deductible paid by the recipient of medical care.We should mention: There's not a clear Obamacare standard of what you have to buy as insurance. The law provides for co-pay-free preventive care, which is what Sebelius clarified Jan. 20. And for individual and small-group plans, the law requires that policies cover essential health benefits. They must include services in 10 categories, but the details have been left to the states.The idea of co-pay-free preventive care stems from studies that show that even moderate co-payskept women from getting care, such as mammograms or pap smears, according to HHS. The nongovernmentalInstitute of Medicinerecommended that preventive services include all FDA-approved forms of contraception. So that's what HHS decided to include in its final rule about preventive services.Most health insurance plans will have to cover them without a co-pay, co-insurance or a deductible. For most new and renewed health plans, that requirement kicks in Aug. 1, 2012. Religious exemptionsNotice we said that most health insurance plans will have to offer co-pay-free preventive care. The U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops said almost every employer and insurer.Gingrich said, every Catholic institution, every Jewish institution, every Protestant institution.But the rule provides an exemption for certain non-profit religious employersthat meet a four-part test-- essentially churches and synagogues, but also some primary and secondary religious schools.It's that definition of religious employer that has prompted theU.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, with the support of groups such as theUnion of Orthodox Jewish Congregations of America, to fight the rule. That's because it wouldn't cover religious organizations that don't primarily employ or serve people of the same religion — ruling out many universities, hospitals and charitable groups.That would require, say, a Catholic hospital to offer insurance coverage to its employees that included FDA-approved contraceptive drugs — which includes some drugs that Catholics consider abortion-inducing. Plan B and Ella prevent fertilization of an egg, prompting the FDA to categorize them as contraceptives rather than abortion-inducing drugs, but Catholics argue that Ellacan be used like the abortifacient RU-486, which isn't considered a contraceptive by the FDA.The government is giving such nonprofit religious groupsan extra yearto implement the preventive care requirements. But it won't exempt them.The decision already faceslegal challengesfrom Belmont Abbey College and Colorado Christian University.Still, if you consider a Catholic church to be a Catholic institution, or a synagogue to be a Jewish institution, Gingrich isn't correct that the recent federal rule on contraceptives applies. Those nonprofit religious employers could choose whether or not they covered contraceptive services.Our ruling Gingrich said that the Obama administration ... would impose on every Catholic institution, every Jewish institution, every Protestant institution the Obamacare standard of what you have to buy as insurance.He makes a broad statement in reference to a rule dealing specifically with co-pays for preventive care -- making it sound as though there's a blanket Obamacare standard for all insurance policies. The reality allows for states to set benchmarks for private individual and small-group plans.Meanwhile, he ignores an exemption in the federal rule for nonprofit religious employers such as churches and synagogues. That exemption has been condemned by Catholic bishops as too narrow and has been challenged in court. But it makes Gingrich's statement that the rule would impose on every ... institution inaccurate and misleading. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/dd0ecf5b-876e-4cfe-ac88-5c90949e8e9f",0.3,0.7,0.8,0.6933137958

False Confidence (between 0 and 1): 0.0",Says Mitt Romney has flip-flopped on abortion rights.,"On Fox News Sunday, Texas Gov. Rick Perry said fellow Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney has changed positions on pivotal topics, including abortion rights. You go back through my record for 20-plus years, I have been a consistent conservative, Perry told Chris Wallace on Oct. 30, 2011. Perry said he has always been pro-life, while Romney has been on both sides of that issue. Hes been ... pro-abortion, Perry said. Perry has lobbed flip-flop charges at Romney, a former Massachusetts governor, since soon after entering the presidential race. During a Sept. 22 Republican presidential debate, Perry, in a halting verbal attack, hit that idea hard, saying that Romney previously had stood up for Roe v. Wade before he was against it. Perry was referring to the 1973 landmark Supreme Court ruling that struck down a Texas law prohibiting nearly all abortions and said states could not prohibit a woman from having an abortion before a fetus is viable, the time at which it can survive outside a woman's body. So, has Romney flip-flopped on abortion rights? For another fact-check, PolitiFact National looked into that question. Romney made several statements about abortion rights earlier in his political career. Here are two of his clearest statements about his position: • In a debate during his unsuccessful 1994 challenge to U.S. Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., Romney said, I believe that abortion should be safe and legal in this country. He added: I believe that since Roe v. Wade has been the law for 20 years, it should be sustained and supported. And I sustain and support that law and support the right of a woman to make that choice. • In his successful 2002 campaign for governor, Romney said during a debate, I will preserve and protect a woman's right to choose and am devoted and dedicated to honoring my word in that regard. Those comments — made in public forums eight years apart — struck us as solid evidence that Romney was then an abortion-rights supporter. What about his views today? The issues portion of his website doesnt have a section on abortion, but Romney wrote an op-ed that was posted on the National Reviews website June 18, 2011, presenting his abortion views. It was written after he risked alienating anti-abortion activists by declining to sign a pledge offered by the Susan B. Anthony List, an anti-abortion group. The pledge includes a promise that if the signer becomes president, he will appoint pro-life candidates to head certain federal agencies such as the Justice Department and to advance legislation cutting off funding to Planned Parenthood clinics and other abortion providers. In the op-ed, Romney wrote: I am pro-life and believe that abortion should be limited to only instances of rape, incest, or to save the life of the mother. I support the reversal of Roe v. Wade, because it is bad law and bad medicine. Roe was a misguided ruling that was a result of a small group of activist federal judges legislating from the bench. I support the Hyde Amendment, which broadly bars the use of federal funds for abortions. And as president, I will support efforts to prohibit federal funding for any organization like Planned Parenthood. Romney goes on to say that if he is elected president, he will push for a law to protect unborn children who are capable of feeling pain from abortion and appoint judges who adhere to the Constitution and the laws as they are written, not as they want them to be written. Our ruling Romneys views on abortion rights today are clearly different from what he expressed in 1994 and 2002. Most significantly, Romney earlier voiced support for the Roe decision; now, he says it should be reversed.",1,0,1,0.8622053721

False Confidence (between 0 and 1): 0.2",The U.S. gun homicide rate is 20 times the combined rate of other western nations.,"U.S. Rep. Jim Moran marked the first anniversary of the shooting of Rep. Gabrielle Giffords in Arizona with a call for more gun control.The U.S. gun homicide rate is 20 times the combined rate of other western nations, Moran, D-8th, wrote in a Jan. 10 columnthat ran in the Falls Church News-Press.That statistic caught our eye. We wondered if Moran is right.A Moran spokeswoman told us the congressmans claim is based on a study of the homicide rates of wealthy nations in 2003, conducted by the UCLA School of Public Health. The report, published in 2010, uses data from the World Health Organization to compare gun-related homicide, gun-related suicide and unintentional and undetermined gun deaths for all ages and both sexes.Vital statistics from the U.S. were compared to those from 22 other high-income countries with populations over 1 million people that reported causes of mortality to WHO for 2003. Researchers relied on The World Banks definition of a high income nation, which included countries that had a gross national income per capita of $12,276 or more for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2011.In addition to the U.S., the study included Australia, Austria, Canada, Czech Republic, Finland, France, Germany, Hungary, Iceland, Italy, Japan, Luxembourg, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Portugal, Slovakia, Spain, Sweden, United Kingdom (England and Wales), United Kingdom (Northern Ireland) and United Kingdom (Scotland).Researchers determined that the rate of homicides with guns in the U.S. was 4.1 per 100,000 people; the same rate combining the 22 other countries was 0.2 per 100,000 in 2003. The rate of homicides using guns in the U.S. was 19.5 times the rate of the other countries. Moran, rounding up, correctly repeated that factoid.We decided to see if there were more recent numbers than 2003. U.N. and nationalstatisticsfor those same countries showed the gap closed. The most recent data, mostly from 2009, shows a gun homicide rate of 3.0 per 100,000 people in the U.S. and 0.2 in the 22 other countries used in the firearm fatality study. The U.S., with its decrease, had a rate around 15 times those of other countries.Next, we moved away from numbers for a second and examined the terminology Moran used in his column. It is imprecise.The congressman wrote that the U.S. gun homicide rate is 20 times higher than other western nations. But in fact, he was comparing them to them a selective group of wealthy nations. And not all them -- such as Japan -- are typically considered a western nation.The term western nation is not listed in Websters New World College Dictionary and we found a range of definitions online.Most commonly, the term is used to describe countries where Western Europeans have settled or have influence. We tried to come up with a list of such nations and settled on the 28 countries that are NATO members.The most recent gun-related homicide rate for the U.S. was 3.0 per 100,000 compared to an 0.3 for the rest of the NATO nations. The U.S. rate was 10 times higher.Our ruling:Moran, calling for stronger gun regulations, wrote The U.S. gun homicide rate is 20 times the combined rate of other western nations.Moran used the right number from a report based on 2003 data. But the researchers did not claim to analyze western nations, they compared gun homicide rates in 23 populous, high income countries, including Japan.If you compare the most recent data on the same group of nations, mostly based on 2009 statistics, the U.S. gun homicide rate is 15 times higher than the other countries. The number fell to 10 times as high when we defined the inexact term of western nations as countries belonging to NATO.So Morans figures are outdated and on the high side. His terminology is loose. But his point -- that gun homicide rates in the U.S. tower over those of other wealthy European nations -- holds up.",0.7,0.3,1,0.656960656

This process, which is reviewed annually, is lengthy and often quite partisan. U.S. Sen. Roy Blunt, R-Mo., sent out a tweet praising the National Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year 2019. He said it includes the largest pay raise in nearly 10 years and provides our service members with the resources, equipment and training they need. We wanted to take a closer look and see if service members were getting everything that Blunt asserted that they would. Thegoal of the act,as stated in its introduction, was to restore readiness and increase capability and capacity in a force that has been asked to do too much with too little for too long. The bill, approved in August, proposed a military budget $639.1 billion with funds divided into areas including: $17.7 billion to rehabilitate and replace worn out Army equipment. $23.5 billion to sustain, repair and rebuild crumbling military buildings and other infrastructure. $36.3 billion to restore Americas strength at sea. $40.8 billion to overcome the crisis in military aviation by getting more aircraft in the air. $69 billion to fund Overseas Contingency Operations. Overseas Contingency Operations are defined as a separate pot of funding that is set aside and operated by the Department of Defense and the State Department. They are sometimes referred to as war funds. The other large component of the act was to provide a 2.6 percent pay raise for those currently serving. This also extended special pay and bonuses for those in high demand fields. To compare the pay raise that service members could receive in 2019 to the ones they have received in the past decade, we reached out to Blunts team. It sent usrecords of the annual pay adjustmentsfor those who have served dating back to 2007. Fiscal year of 2010 was the last time a pay raise greater than 2.6 percent was awarded. From 2011 to 2016, the pay raise remained under 2 percent. Mark Cancian, a Center for Strategic and International Studies senior advisor on the International Security Program, shared records of military and civilian pay increases, including estimates up to 2023. The information was published by the Department of Defenses Comptroller inTable 5-12of National Defense Budget Estimates for fiscal year 2019. Experts we reached out to agreed that the first part of Blunts statement rang true. Although last years pay raise is just shy of 2.6 percent, the last pay raise higher that was higher was offered nine years ago. Todd Harrison, the strategic centers director of defense budget analysis, said that is is fair to say that the bill fully authorizes the level of total funding that the Department of Defense requested. Blunt said that members of the military would receive their highest pay raise in nearly 10 years thanks to legislation signed in August. Military compensation records and experts in defense analysis and government spending fields verified that this was correct.",1,0,1,0.1003870522

On Fox Newss The Five, hosts Bob Beckel and Eric Bolling came down on either side while discussing how the economy has fared under President Barack Obama. America has the most number of deductions available to corporations, Beckel said. They pay lower taxes than a lot of European countries do, and under Obama, I have not seen corporate taxes go up all that much. Just to fact-check you a little bit, responded Bolling, we have the highest corporate tax rate in the free world. Beckel repeated his point, then Bolling pointed towards Pfizer and Burger King going overseas for what he called tax inversion. Theyre going there specifically to capture a lower corporate income tax, said Bolling. We separately checked Beckels claim about deductions, but in this check, well see whether Bolling is correct that the United States corporate tax rate ranks as the highest in the free world. The rate in theory We decided to focus on the countries that belong to the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development, a group that includes most advanced, industrialized nations. That fits our bill for a proxy for the free world. Out of the 34 countries in the OECD, America ranks first with a 39.1 percent corporate tax rate, compared to an OECD average of 24.1 percent. The OECD figure is whats called the statutory rate, meaning the base rate applied to corporate profits. According to the Tax Foundation, two non-OECD countries -- the United Arab Emirates (55 percent) and Chad (40 percent) -- have a greater statutory rate than the United States. But the UAE is governed by a monarchy and Chad is a developing country, so we dont think they would fit into the free world category Bolling used. The rate in practice PolitiFact, our sister site, has looked at several variations on Bollings claim and ruled them Mostly True almost every time. The reason for the mostly qualifier is that companies arent actually taxed at the statutory rate. Tax deductions -- on health insurance, pensions, and investment returns, for example -- allow corporations to reduce the pool of taxable profits. So economists often look at what they call the effective tax rate, which experts have told us is just as valid a measurement of corporate tax rates as the statutory rate. But whereas the statutory rate is relatively straightforward and uncontroversial, different, reputable organizations have published very different estimates of the effective tax rate that corporations pay. The most recent estimate comes from the World Bank and International Finance Commission, which put the United States effective rate for 2014 at 27.9 percent. Thats second-highest behind New Zealand among OECD countries and 15th-highest among the 189 countries measured. In 2011, the Tax Foundation published a survey of 13 prior estimates of the United States effective tax rate from 2005 to 2011. All 13 studies pegged the U.S.s rate as above average, but none had the U.S. rate first overall. Another 2011 study by the Congressional Research Service put the U.S. effective rate at 27.1 percent, slightly lower than the OECD average of 27.7 percent. Taxes are convoluted Different studies disagree on effective corporate tax rates because corporate tax rates tend to vary widely depending on the industry, said Alan Viola, resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute. The biggest deduction that varies across countries is how generous the depreciation schedule is, said Alan Viard, resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute. When a business does an investment, equipment, a building, they dont normally get to deduct the whole cost that year. They have to do it over time. Faster is better, said Viard, but depreciation rates vary depending on what types of equipment a company is buying. Many studies also dont account for what the United States classifies as S-corporations, meaning businesses that pay tax through the individual income-tax system rather than the corporate income-tax system, Viard said. This represents about 30 percent of American companies, he said. So while effective tax rates are a good estimate of the corporate tax burden in the United States, particular businesses burden may vary. Our ruling Bolling said the United States has the highest corporate tax rate in the free world. He was referring to the statutory rate, meaning the rate before deductions. On that score, hes right: The United States does have the highest statutory rate among developed countries. However, the United States corporate tax rate doesnt appear to be the highest once deductions and other exclusions are taken into account. So Bolling is correct by one valid definition.",0.75,0.2,0.8,0.4201512832

Even as it has faded from view, however, the war has grown ever deadlier, President Barack Obama said in a speech to government officials and military officers at the White House on March 27, 2009. It's been more than seven years since the Taliban was removed from power, yet war rages on, and insurgents control parts of Afghanistan and Pakistan, Obama said, announcing the deployment of 17,000 more troops to Afghanistan. Attacks against our troops, our NATO allies, and the Afghan government have risen steadily. And most painfully, 2008 was the deadliest year of the war for American forces. We wondered if that was true and checked the latestPentagon statistics. Indeed, U.S. military deaths numbered 155 in 2008, which is the highest since the war began in 2001. The number of U.S. deaths has increased almost every year, with two exceptions. The year-to-year fatality count, from 2001 to 2008, is: 11, 48, 45, 52, 98, 98, 117, 155. In the first two months of 2009, there were 30 U.S. military deaths, putting this year on pace to be the deadliest yet. We looked for any indication that this statistic was unrepresentative of the conditions in Afghanistan. Quite the contrary — it is one of several measures by which the situation in Afghanistan has deteriorated. The number of U.S. military personnel wounded in action has also increased every year, from 33 in 2001 to 790 in 2008, totaling 2,713. Military deaths of personnel from the 21 other outside countries involved in the conflict have increased every year since 2004, to a peak so far of 139 in 2008 (and 2009 is on pace to surpass that). Afghan civilian casualties hit a high mark too last year, with 2,118 civilians killed, up from 1,523 in 2007, according to the United Nations. In testimony to the House Armed Services Committee in September, Adm. Mike Mullen, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said Taliban and al-Qaida fighters are coordinating better from safe havens in Pakistan and launching ever more sophisticated, even infantry-like attacks against fixed coalition positions. I'm not convinced we're winning it in Afghanistan, Mullen said. Defense Secretary Robert Gates told the committee Afghanistan was in some ways a more complex challenge than Iraq. We don't have a single adversary, he said. We have the Taliban, we have the Gulbuddin Hekmatyar group, we have the Haqqani network, we have narco-thugs, we have al-Qaida, we have foreign fighters. So Obama's claim is not only technically correct, but also accurately reflects the deteriorating security conditions in Afghanistan. We find his claim to be True.",1,0,1,0.587521906

Tony Evers has laid out a series of key benchmarks for easing social distancing restrictions, dubbed the Badger Bounce Back plan. The state is tracking data on cases, symptoms and hospital usage, but Evers has also pointed to three other logistical elements: access to personal protective gear, expanded testing and expanded contact tracing. Senate Majority Leader Scott Fitzgerald homed in on the last of those while criticizing Evers in an April 26, 2020, interview with WISN-TVs UpFront program. We need better information. More explanations, said Fitzgerald, R-Juneau. They have no tracing program going on that we can speak of. Contact tracing, done by public health officials, is the process of supporting patients with suspected or confirmed infections. Steps include identifying who else they had contact with, warning those other individuals and educating everyone exposed on how to protect themselves and others through isolation and other steps. Its a fundamental element of the pandemic response, helping to identify clusters of cases early on to minimize the spread. Does Wisconsin really have no such program to speak of? Asked for evidence of the claim, Fitzgerald spokesman Alec Zimmerman said this: The point he was trying to make is the same that (Wisconsin Department of Health Services) makes daily in the briefings -- tracing as it is now isnt enough. Zimmerman noted the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel has reported on shortcomings in the system. For instance, the newspaper contacted 10 people who had the disease or lost loved ones within the first few weeks of the outbreak, and seven said they were never contacted by health officials as of April 23 when the story published. A story published May 1, 2020, detailed how Milwaukee has added staffing and made other changes to improve the tracing program. Health officials across the nation are scrambling to add contact tracers. The number of tracers needed for the pandemic is about double the usual need, according to the National Association of County and City Health Officials. Public health nurses do this regularly, for example, for sexually transmitted diseases or tuberculosis, DHS spokeswoman Elizabeth Goodsitt said in an email. What is new in this space is mainly the large scale of cases and the speed at which the virus is able to spread – which means we need additional contact tracers to do this work so that we are able to reach each identified exposed person really quickly. DHS doesnt know how many tracers are working in Wisconsin or how many tracing investigations have been done since those efforts are lead by local health departments. DHS Deputy Secretary Julie Willems Van Dijk said at the April 28 COVID-19 media briefing that the goal is to have 1,000 contact tracers between the DHS surge capacity and the capacity of local health departments. The state had trained 400 contact tracers as of April 30 to provide surge capacity for local health departments, Goodsitt said. The number trained was closer to 250 when Fitzgerald made his claim. The state surge team has been part of more than 1,100 interviews (as of April 30), which is just a fraction of calls our local public health tracers have made, Goodsitt said. The number of tracers varies widely among some of the states larger health departments. As of April 25, the Journal Sentinel reported the Milwaukee Health Department had dedicated 19 people to tracing, about 8% of its staff (though that was up to 54 by May 1, 2020). The Washington Ozaukee Health Department had dedicated 15 people, or about 38% of its 40-person staff. CBS 58 reported April 23 that Waukesha County had 30 contact tracers. Milwaukee officials told the Journal Sentinel the initial tracing interview had been conducted within a week for 92% of all positive cases in the city, but its an extensive process. They make about 10 contacts for every positive case. Fitzgerald said Wisconsin has no tracing program going on that we can speak of. Wisconsin — like every other state — is still ramping up the capacity for tracing. And there have clearly been gaps in the work so far. But its a significant exaggeration to summarize that as having no program when hundreds of people are doing this work around the state. Tracing was being done around the state when Fitzgerald said this, and those efforts have continued to ramp up since. ",0.5,0.6,0.9,0.3847430206

Or maybe its just Coke? While in bubbly debate over what to call soft drinks -- your PolitiFact Oregon staff does not agree on this -- a colleague of ours suggested a potential fact check that anyone might find intriguing, no matter what they call their carbonated beverage of choice. Youve probably seen the Sugar Packs ads around Multnomah County, put there by the Health Department as part of a healthy living and anti-obesity campaign that started in 2010.Its the one with a pile of packets of white sugar draining into a 20-ounce bottle of generic cola. Your kid just ate 16 packs of sugar, the ad states. All those extra calories can bring on obesity, diabetes and heart disease.Sixteen packets? Our collective stomachs cramped. Our teeth ached. We swallowed our distaste and started checking.Soda-sleuthing turned out to be quite easy, namely because theres a lot of pop in a newsroom. In fact, we found more than a dozen empties within spitting distance. A 12-ounce can of Coca-Cola regular, we learned, contains 39 grams of sugar, usually from high-fructose corn syrup in the United States. A 20-ounce bottle would then contain 65 grams of sugar. Corn syrup is not the same as white table sugar, but the county is talking equivalents. A packet of table sugar as shown in the ad is equal to about a teaspoon, or about 4 grams of sugar. So, indeed, there are at least 16 packs of sugar in every 20-ounce bottle of regular cola.Theres no arguing that thats a large chunk of sweet. The American Heart Association recommends no more than nine teaspoons -- nine packets -- of added sugar a day for adult men. For women, its six.But just for the fun of it -- no, were not on a sugar high -- we wanted to know what else could contain the equivalent of 16 packets of granulated white. And bingo: A 16-ounce Jamba Juice Banana Berry contains 60 grams of sugar. A 12-ounce Chocolate McCafe shake from McDonalds has 76 grams.A Starbucks Grande non-fat, no-whip Caramel Frappucino Blended Beverage contains 59 grams of sugar, although to be fair, the drink also includes 4 grams of nutritious protein. The iced lemon pound cake contains 46 grams of sugar -- but then, all you adults knew that -- and PolitiFact Oregon has fallen into tangential research.Back to the point.We figure children dont usually indulge in diet sodas, which are made with artificial sweeteners like aspartame, and not with corn syrup or sugar. Were told by a beverage trade publication that 12-ounce cans are the top sellers -- but a 20-ounce bottle doesnt seem out of line in this age of super-sized drinks and Double Big Gulps.Its whats available in our environment, said Sonia Manhas, who manages the program for the county.After all, McDonalds markets a 16-ounce soda as a small-sized soft drink and a 12-ounce drink as child-sized. We figure parents are smart enough to figure out the sugar-gram-to-cola-ounce ratio themselves. The smaller the drink, the fewer the sugar packets.All this really means is that we find the countys statement accurate. And thats the unsugar-coated truth.",1,0,1,0.2209346066

But somehow he's managing to get the latter without getting any of the former, he said in a recent radio interview. The most recent Associated Press poll has Nader-Gonzalez at 6 percent, without any national coverage, against McCain and Obama, Nader said during a June 18interviewonDemocracy Now!,an independent, left-leaning radio program. Nader garnered less than half that in the 2000 election and, by many accounts, damaged Al Gore enough to hand George W. Bush the White House. We checkedthe Associated Press pollsand found none that gave Nader 6 percent. The most recent AP poll prior to the interview was an AP-Yahoo poll from April 17 that had Nader at 3 percent. Nader spokesman Chris Driscoll acknowledged the candidate had erred, and said he meant to cite a June 6CNN/Opinion Research Corp. poll, which did indeed have Nader and his running mate Matt Gonzalez at 6 percent against Democratic Sen. Barack Obama, Republican Sen. John McCain and former GOP Rep. Bob Barr, the Libertarian candidate. The finding needs context, though. Was it just an outlier? And what does it say about how Nader will do in November? Other recent polls show Nader with less support.A Rasmussen Reports pollreleased May 18 showed Nader pulling in 4 percent against Obama, McCain and Barr.A Reuters/Zogby pollreleased June 18 showed Nader with 3 percent.A Fox News/Opinion Dynamics pollreleased June 19, the day after Nader's interview, gave him 4 percent. History suggests, however, that even these polls overstate Nader's prospects. At this time in 2000, he was showing around 4 or 5 percent in most national polls, and he ended up with 2.7 percent of the vote. Around this time in 2004, polls had Nader at anywhere from 3 to 7 percent. He got just .38 percent in the end. Now, onto Nader's assertion that his support has come without any national coverage. Clearly he was speaking rhetorically — we found his name mentioned 166 times on the major broadcast and cable news programs between the first of the year and the June 18 interview. But that's six months. Obama and McCain had been mentioned on television about that much in just the previous three days. Nader's coverage had been so slight compared to that of the major-party candidates that we have a hard time holding his hyperbole against him. We are also reluctant to pick on Nader too much for getting the name of a poll wrong. So with the caveat that his claim says little about how he'll do in November, we find it Mostly True.

One claim the organizations director made as part of her argument against the referendum seemed worthy of a fact-check.For every one mile of light-rail track that will be built, 16 miles of new road capacity will be built, Colleen Kiernan said in a radio interview with WABE-FMs Denis OHayer.Hmmm. Is that correct? Lets take a ride in search of the truth.The list for the 10-county Atlanta region contains 157 projects, according to the Atlanta Regional Commission, which provided data and analysis to officials involved in putting together the list.The Sierra Club sent PolitiFact Georgia a spreadsheet with about 70 projects that would increase the number of lanes of some roads or make them longer. Some of the road projects on the list include: The road projects would increase capacity by 367 miles, ARC says.By comparison, there are three confirmed light-rail projects on the list: along the Atlanta Beltline, the Atlanta streetcar and a line on Clifton Corridor from the Lindbergh Center in Atlanta to Emory University in DeKalb County. A proposed rail line from Cobb County to Midtown Atlanta would need federal funding and is not currently considered a light-rail project.The referendums supporters say the lack of light or heavy rail in the plan is not a lack of will, but a matter of math. The light rail on the Beltline and Clifton Corridor is expected to cost about $1.3 billion, or about $60 million a mile. The referendum is projected to raise about $8.5 billion over the life span of the tax, 10 years.Jane Hayse, ARCs transportation division chief, said the light-rail projects are 21 miles combined.So what about the Sierra Clubs calculation of a 16-to-1 ratio of road projects to light rail? According to ARC, there are 17.5 miles of increased road capacity in the plan for each mile of proposed light rail.Mathematically, it is accurate, Hayse told us. However, the comparison is erroneous. It compares apples to bananas.Hayse said in order to fairly fact-check the Sierra Clubs claim, you must consider all the additional bus projects in the plan. The list includes express bus service in portions of the region and $100 million for bus service in Clayton County, which ended its bus operations a few years ago due to budget cuts. In all, ARC said there is an additional 371 miles of bus service on the list.ARC spokesman Jim Jaquish said the organization will not take a position on the referendum because it is a nonprofit that receives taxpayer dollars. Jaquish did say ARC believes the list is made up of sound, needed projects.Hayse said express bus service is more logical for some parts of the Atlanta suburbs because people do not live and work as closely together as they do in the city. Hayse said rail stations are typically three miles apart, whereas express bus service has longer distances between stops.Light rail just doesnt make sense for the whole region, she said.Kiernan countered that bus service is not a sure thing, noting that Clayton Countys bus service, C-Tran, was discontinued.Our argument is that the amount of fixed, permanent transit infrastructure that we know will be built by the tax is overwhelmed by the amount of fixed road infrastructure we know will be built, Kiernan wrote via email. Traditional express and local bus service is a completely different animal ... and the suggestion that miles of bus service is somehow equivalent to miles of permanent fixed-guideway infrastructure is highly misleading.Kiernans claim is essentially correct. But it needs a bit of context to move higher on the Truth-O-Meter.Under our rating system, Kiernan gets a Mostly True.",0.9,0.2,0.9,0.2622305667

Richard Hudson voted NO.","With inflation high and many Americans concerned about COVID-19, a Democratic congressional candidate in North Carolina says a Republican incumbent isnt doing enough to ease the burden of medical costs. State Sen. Ben Clark, D-Hoke, is running in the states newly-drawn 9th Congressional District, where hell face Republican U.S. Rep. Richard Hudson if both win their primaries. The district, which leans Republican, is located in south-central North Carolina near Fayetteville. On April 1, Clarks campaign emailed supporters slamming Hudson for how he voted the day before. The email said: Yesterday, the House voted to cap insulin prices to $35/month, just $420 each year! Richard Hudson voted NO. Clarks campaign also tweeted about Hudson, posting that he voted no to lowering the cost of insulin for every family in the 9th Congressional District. What legislation was Clark talking about? And did Hudson really vote against lowering insulin costs? A review of the record shows Clark got this wrong. The U.S. House of Representatives on March 31 voted on H.R.6833, known as the Affordable Insulin Now Act, which would cap insulin co-payments for insured Americans at $35 a month.It would help some Americans save hundreds of dollars annually and offer all insured patients more predictable insulin costs, but wouldnt help the uninsured, the Associated Press reported. The Democrat-led bill passed 232-193 with the help of 12 Republicans — and congressional records show Hudson was one of them. Several media outlets — including Business Insider, the Daily Mail and Yahoo! News — named Hudson among the bills Republican supporters. PolitiFact NC reached out to Clarks campaign shortly after it published the email and tweet about Hudsons vote. The campaign, which deleted its tweet about Hudson, defended its accusations. As far as we know, the Clark campaign hasnt issued a correction to its email. We are aware that last night Richard Hudson changed his vote on capping the cost of insulin to $35/month after voting against this and other bills to reduce the cost of prescription drugs numerous times, the campaign said. After being consistently rated as one of the most conservative Republicans in the House, no one is fooled by his recent shift to the center. We asked the campaign what it meant when it said Hudson changed his vote, but didnt receive a response. Hudsons office said the congressmans March 31 vote is in line with other efforts to reduce insulin prices. Jordan Shaw, one of Hudsons advisors, said Hudson co-sponsored the Lower Costs, More Cures Act of 2019, or H.R. 19, which would have capped the cost of insulin for some Medicare customers. Congressman Hudson was proud to vote to cap out-of-pocket costs for seniors on insulin, and has long advocated for caps on prescription drug costs like those in HR 19. He didnt change his vote, Shaw said. Clark said: Yesterday, the House voted to cap insulin prices to $35/month, just $420 each year! Richard Hudson voted NO.

",Accuses President Barack Obama of making contradictory claims about efforts to kill Osama bin Laden in 2008 and 2011.,"A reader recently forwarded us a chain e-mail thats been making the rounds, accusing President Barack Obama of hypocrisy over the raid that resulted in the killing of al-Qaida leader Osama bin Laden on May 1, 2011. A Google search also indicated that the text of the e-mail has been popping up widely in blogs and comment threads. Heres the full text of the version we received:Here are the facts, you be the judge. These words were spoken by the same man in 2008 and then again in 2011.Short and sweetOBAMA'S OWN WORDS TRAP HIM: 2008: Navy Seal Team 6 is Cheney's private assassination team.2011: I put together Seal Team 6 to take out Bin Laden.2008: Bin Laden is innocent until proven guilty, and must be captured alive and given a fair trial.2011: I authorized Seal Team 6 to kill Bin Laden.2008: Guantanamo is entirely unnecessary, and the detainees should not be interrogated.2011: Vital intelligence was obtained from Guantanamo detainees that led to our locating Bin Laden.I HOPE THIS GETS SENT AROUND TO PEOPLE WHO CARE ABOUT THE TRUTH!We thought wed look into whether the quotations in the e-mail were accurate. We did extensive searches on Google, in the Lexis-Nexis news database and the White Houses own website, as well as checking with a few experts. The White House did not respond to our query.While its impossible to prove a negative, we found no evidence to support the notion that Obama said any of these things. In fact, several of the statements are directly contradicted by the evidence we found.Well take the quotes one by one.2008: Navy Seal Team 6 is Cheney's private assassination team.We found occasional references in the media to assassination teams that were answerable to Vice President Dick Cheney, but no evidence that Obama ever said anything of the sort.In a March 11, 2009, speech at the University of Minnesota, veteran investigative reporter Seymour Hersh referred to the Joint Special Operations Command -- a special wing of our special operations community that is set up independently, as he put it. They do not report to anybody, except in the Bush-Cheney days, they reported directly to the Cheney office. ... Congress has no oversight of it. Its an executive assassination ring essentially....Later, during the July 15, 2009, edition of Countdown with Keith Olbermann -- a now-defunct nightly show on MSNBC -- the liberal host introduced a segment by saying that it was time to look at what we know about the Bush-Cheney assassination teams. The segment addressed purported assassination efforts under both the CIA and the Pentagon. The latter sent killing teams into the field, where they actually killed people, including those affiliated with al-Qaida, Olbermann said.Almost two years later, such comments became somewhat prescient, when details of the bin Laden raid became known. The counter-terrorist team that carried out the raid was the Naval Special Warfare Development Group, or DevGru for short. (The team is popularly, though incorrectly, known by one of its several former names, SEAL Team Six.) DevGru has been around since the early 1980s, usually shrouded in secrecy given its sensitive work. According to globalsecurity.org, it is a component of the Joint Special Operations Command.From whats been reported, its unclear whether DevGru truly was answerable to Cheney during his two terms as vice president. But the group existed, and the bin Laden raid certainly suggests that it has the ability -- at least in some cases -- to act as an assassination team.Still, the e-mail is wrong to suggest that Obama ever said or wrote that Navy Seal Team 6 is Cheney's private assassination team before he became president (or, for that matter, after).2011: I put together Seal Team 6 to take out Bin Laden.During his May 1, 2011, announcement of bin Ladens death, Obama detailed his role in ordering the bin Laden raid. But he never claimed that he had created the unit that carried out the raid (which he didnt, in any case).Obama said in his announcement that shortly after he took office, I directed Leon Panetta, the director of the CIA, to make the killing or capture of bin Laden the top priority of our war against al-Qaida, even as we continued our broader efforts to disrupt, dismantle, and defeat his network.  Last week, I determined that we had enough intelligence to take action, and authorized an operation to get Osama bin Laden and bring him to justice.Today, at my direction, the United States launched a targeted operation against that compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan. A small team of Americans carried out the operation with extraordinary courage and capability. No Americans were harmed. They took care to avoid civilian casualties. After a firefight, they killed Osama bin Laden and took custody of his body.In a lengthy interview conducted on May 4, 2011, Obama sounded a similar note.Obviously we have extraordinary guys, Obama told Steve Kroft of the CBS newsmagazine 60 Minutes. Our Special Forces are the best of the best. And so I was not involved in designing the initial plan. But each iteration of that plan they'd bring back to me. Make a full presentation. We would ask questions. We had multiple meetings in the Situation Room in which we would map out -- and we would actually have a model of the compound and discuss how this operation might proceed, and what various options there were because there was more than one way in which we might go about this.We did not find any evidence that Obama had claimed to have created the special forces team that carried out the raid.2008: Bin Laden is innocent until proven guilty and must be captured alive and given a fair trial.Obama never said this. In fact, he took the opposite stance in one of the presidential debates in 2008.If we have Osama bin Laden in our sights and the Pakistani government is unable or unwilling to take them out, then I think that we have to act, and we will take them out, Obama said. We will kill bin Laden. We will crush al-Qaida. That has to be our biggest national security priority.The closest we could find was a comment -- quickly retracted -- that was made in 2003 by Howard Dean. Dean, the former governor of Vermont, was running for the Democratic presidential nomination at the time.In December 2003, Dean told the Concord Monitor that he had resisted pronouncing a sentence (on bin Laden) before guilt is found. I still have this old-fashioned notion that even with people like Osama, who is very likely to be found guilty, we should do our best not to, in positions of executive power, not to prejudge jury trials.After a flurry of condemnations, Dean reversed course just a few hours later. He told the Associated Press that, as an American, I want to make sure he gets the death penalty he deserves. He also issued a statement that said in part, Bin Laden has admitted that he is responsible for killing 3,000 Americans as well as scores of men, women and children around the world. This is exactly the kind of case that the death penalty is meant for.2011: I authorized Seal Team 6 to kill Bin Laden.Obama didnt use the phrasing cited in the chain e-mail, but as we indicated earlier, theres no question that he took responsibility for ordering the raid.There is evidence that U.S. forces would have accepted a surrender by bin Laden, rather than killing him, under certain circumstances. After the raid, according to ABC News, State Department legal adviser Harold Koh wrote in a blog post that forces were prepared to capture bin Laden if he had surrendered in a way that they could safely accept in accordance with the laws of armed conflict which require the acceptance of a genuine offer of surrender, clearly communicated by the surrendering party under circumstances where it would be feasible for the forces to accept the offer of surrender.Still, Koh wrote that bin Laden was a lawful target under the Authorization for Use of Military Force passed by Congress in 2001. It allows military force against those that have planned, authorized, committed or aided the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001.2008: Guantanamo is entirely unnecessary, and the detainees should not be interrogated.This statement has a grain of truth, but it is exaggerated.During the campaign, Obama made no secret of his disagreement with elements of the Bush Administrations national security policy. He promised to close the detention facility at Guantanamo (which we have rated a Promise Broken) and to end the use of torture without exception (which we have rated In the Works).Obamas desire to close Guantanamo could be construed as him believing that the facility is entirely unnecessary, but its wrong to say that he believed that detainees shouldnt be interrogated. Interrogation is a standard procedure in law enforcement and intelligence. Obama wanted to end the use of torture.We also found no evidence that Obama uttered these words.2011: Vital intelligence was obtained from Guantanamo detainees that led to our locating Bin Laden.Some, including Cheney, have suggested that the Bin Laden raid benefited from intelligence gained through interrogation techniques that Obama has criticized as torture. This question has not been definitively settled, although the White House downplayed the possibility.Reporting from detainees was just a slice of the information that has been gathered by incredibly diligent professionals over the years in the intelligence community, White House spokesman Jay Carney said on May 3, 2011. And it simply strains credulity to suggest that a piece of information that may or may not have been gathered in -- eight years ago somehow directly led to a successful mission on Sunday. That's just not the case.John Pike, the director of globalsecurity.org, said that the words attributed to Obama on Guantanamo are ludicrous. It is not something he would have said, and there is no evidence that it is something that he did say.And in this case too, we found no evidence that Obama uttered the words attributed to him. As you may know I have been critical of Obama's national security policies, said Professor Jeff Addicott, director of the Center for Terrorism Law at St. Mary's University School of Law. That said, I have never heard him make the 2008 remarks, and I follow him very closely.Our ruling A few of the sentiments have some link to reality – Obama did order the raid to kill bin Laden, and he did oppose Guantanamo, even though he ultimately failed to carry through on his promise to close it. The critics may have wished Obama had made these statements, but appears the statements have no basis in reality. It's clear from our research that all six quotes are fabrications. Once again a widely circulated chain e-mail is spreading ridiculous falsehoods about Obama.",0.1,0.9,0.7,0.3038122427

False Confidence (between 0 and 1): 0.0",My Treasury team eliminated a 900-case backlog in the Crime Victim Compensation Program.,"As a candidate for governor, state General Treasurer Gina Raimondo has been touting her experience in the venture capital business as an asset when it comes to running the treasurers office, and possibly the rest of state government. On her campaign website, under the headline Making Government Work, she says she implemented a strategy to streamline management in her office. As evidence, she claims that under her tenure, the treasurers office cleared a 900-claim backlog in the state Crime Victim Compensation Program that had been building up for years. She makes a similar claim on the treasurers website. We decided to check her claim on those claims. The Crime Victim Compensation Program pays grants to Rhode Island crime victims or their family members. Awards can be used to help pay for expenses such as health insurance deductibles, medical care, lost wages, mental health therapy, crime scene cleanup or funeral costs. Individual victims often file more than one claim, but the maximum amount any one person can receive is $25,000. Most of the programs money comes from fines and assessments levied in the state courts, augmented by federal funds.  When we asked Raimondos office for backup, her staff provided a breakdown of the unresolved claim backlog that they said they found after sorting through the compensation programs files when she took office in 2011. It comprised 912 claims by 415 people. The names of the individuals and the doctors or health care providers who were paid were redacted from the documents we received. Treasurers office spokeswoman Joy Fox said fund staffers began going through the paperwork in the files around the middle of 2011, finishing around November. During that time they found instances in which claims had been filed but not decided, and others in which claims had been approved but not paid. The accounting listed the date that each backlogged claim was filed, how much was sought, when it was approved or denied, how much was awarded if it had been approved, when the check was issued and the check number. The earliest claim went back to 2007. After the list was compiled, Fox said the effort to resolve them began in January 2012. According to the payment accounting from Raimondos office, by June of 2012 about 95 percent of the claims had resolved. The remainder, 47 claims, were finished by December 2012. Since then, the average wait time for a new claim to be resolved is 28.9 days, the treasurers office said in its 2013 annual report on the program to the General Assembly. Of the 912 claims, 391 were approved for some kind of award, about 43 percent. The total amount paid out on those came to $681,890.67. We wanted to find independent verification of that figure.  So we went to the treasurers office online transparency portal, which lists the checks issued by the state in given fiscal years. We looked for the 391 checks on the backlog list and found 310 matches -- enough to give us confidence in Raimondos figure. Fox said the rest dont show individually on the transparency portal because the state consolidates multiple payments to single health care service providers into a single combined number for each payee. Our ruling Gina Raimondo said her office was able to resolve 900 pending claims from the states Crime Victim Compensation Program since she became general treasurer in 2011. Her staff provided an accounting that outlined the effort. It showed 912 claims resolved, 12 more than she said. We independently verified enough of the claims to rule her statement True.

False Confidence (between 0 and 1): 0.2",Says IBM leader told Obama that using IBM technology to cut fraud could pay for health care reform.,"During a discussion of health care costs at a Nov. 5, 2011, two-person GOP presidential debate outside Houston, Republican presidential candidate Newt Gingrich made a dramatic claim about a White House visit.Gingrich, who was debating then-candidate Herman Cain, said: The CEO of IBM went to the White House and said to (President) Barack Obama, you can pay for virtually all of Obamacare by simply taking existing IBM technology and applying it to stop paying crooks.By Obamacare, a term that some view as polarizing shorthand, Gingrich meant the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, the Democrat-led 2010 overhaul of health care laws. Obama affixed a price tag of $900 billion to the plan when he rolled out his version in September 2009. Subsequent cost estimates varied. So, Gingrich is suggesting a lot of fraud. But was he right that IBM presented the president with such a scheme?By way of background, we note that Gingrich has long advocated using technology to help cut health-care costs. Until recently he led a for-profit consultancy called the Center for Health Transformations, which counted IBM among its clients.We asked Gingrichs campaign for the former House speakers basis in making the statement. Spokesman Joe DeSantis told us: All I can say is that he heard it from someone he trusts. Sorry.But DeSantis directed us to video of a Sept. 14, 2010, Wall Street Journal interview of Sam Palmisano, IBMs then-CEO and chairman.Separately, IBM spokesman Ed Barbini also referred us to the Journal interview. He declined further comment.The video opens with the Journals Alan Murray saying: When President Obama was elected, you started spending a fair amount of time at the White House.Palmisano: Yes, I did.Murray: What was that all about?Well, Palmisano replied, part of it was the administration was reaching out to the business community. I mean, I was one of many, obviously ... around economic (issues)... So we were having lots of input, lots of exchange. Thats what we all were working on at the time.Asked how he thought the White House visits had turned out, Palmisano replied: We havent made any progress. It doesnt mean there hasnt been a lot of interaction.Murray: Well, whats the point of interaction if it doesnt lead to progress?Palmisano: Youd have to ask the people who arent progressing.He added, Weve done tons of work, and for whatever sets of reasons, we havent been able to establish, be in sync with, the priorities.Palmisano offered an example: We -- and Im fairly confident about this one because it required no legislative change -- we could have improved quality and reduced the costs of the health-care system by $900 billion... It was self-funding. You could have insured anybody you wanted to, illegal aliens, dogs, cats, ponies, whatever, right? And the stuff was simple. Did not require any big legislative change.About $400 billion of the reduced costs could be realized through negotiating discounts with drug companies, just as IBM negotiates its own discounts, he said. Buy a nationwide discount, he said. Just like pharmaceutical companies sell to us on a nationwide discount. Its no different. I said, Take the IBM discount! Take the IBM discount. Another example of savings: Two hundred billion in fraud. That was a 3 percent improvement, by the way. This wasnt transformational. ... Theres so much fraud in the system -- 3 percent and then Year 7 was 8 percent, Year 5 was 5 percent. Its 200 billion.Murray: And why didnt they do that? Is there a fraud --Palmisano: I said we would do it for free to prove that it works. They turned us down. Youll have to ask them Free. Free wasnt good enough.Murray asks again: Why?Palmisano replies, I think what it is, not to be judgmental about these things, I really do think what it is is that we weren't aligning with the priorities. ... the priority at the time, if I stay on my example of health care, was not to reduce costs and improve quality. It was to provide insurance and coverage for more people. That was our priority in the line. All we said, if you did this you could fund the priority without increasing the deficit, taking taxes up. And we couldn't sell the case.Lets take a breath here. In the Journal interview, Palmisano insisted he gave the White House an offer to cover the $900 billion estimated cost of the health care plan -- with $200 billion coming from reduced fraud.We were unable to find independent confirmation of such an offer -- and our search of news archives indicates the CEOs comments to the Journal touched off only one follow-up news account. Nearly a month after the interview, on the Oct. 8, 2010, episode of a Fox News program, guest host Stuart Varney said that an IBM spokesman stood by Palmisanos claims.That program aired shortly after a more widely publicized event: On Oct. 6, 2010, Palmisano led a group of high-tech CEOs to the White House to present Obama with a proposal they said could save the government $1 trillion by 2020.Among the plans seven initiatives: saving $500 billion by streamlining supply chains and pushing suppliers to reduce costs; and saving $200 billion by using technology to better detect improper payments -- payments that prove to be unnecessary or fraudulent. The proposal cites an Office of Management and Budget estimate that Medicare accounted for $54 billion of the governments $98 billion in improper payments in 2009.By email, White House spokesman Brandon Lepow did not provide information confirming or denying Palmisanos claims to the Journal about presenting savings ideas. Lepow initially said companies including IBM had offered the administration help fighting fraud. He later told us he had learned his first statement was inaccurate. His follow-up statement said the administration and IBM had worked on possible projects but agreed not to move forward, although IBM is a partner in our work to fight fraud.Our rulingGingrich did not reveal the source of his claim or provide backup beyond the Journal interview. Meantime, the White House did not confirm or deny Palmisanos claims. Contrary to Gingrichs debate claim, though, the then-CEO said $200 billion in funding would come from cutting fraud -- not nearly enough to pay for the health-care overhaul.",0.6,0.4,0.8,0.7762381849

False Confidence (between 0 and 1): 0.05","This March, for the first time in human history, the monthly average carbon dioxide in our atmosphere exceeded 400 parts per million. The range had been 170-300 parts per million for hundreds of thousands of years.","Sheldon Whitehouse gave his 100th speech on climate change on the floor of the U.S. Senate on May 18, 2015. Over the past three years, the senator has served up several climate claims worth checking during his running series Time to wake up. So we examined his 100th installment and noticed this statement: This March, for the first time in human history, the monthly average carbon dioxide in our atmosphere exceeded 400 parts per million. The range had been 170-300 parts per million for hundreds of thousands of years. Scientists, who see climate change as Whitehouse does, say the concentration of carbon dioxide (CO2) in the earths atmosphere is increasing due, in large part, to the burning of fossil fuels. And they say rising CO2 levels are an indicator that humans are degrading the health of the planet. We went looking for evidence and quickly found a report from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration that seemed right on target. On May 6, NOAA announced that the monthly global average of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere had exceeded 400 parts per million — for the first time since it had been compiling the data in 1979. This seemed to leave only the human history part of Whitehouses claim in question. But when Whitehouse addressed the issue May 18, he did not specify his source. And, confusingly, he spoke of a monthly average not a monthly global average, the term used by NOAA. The distinction is relevant: While the NOAA monthly global average had never exceeded 400 over a period of more than 35 years, the agencys scientists had previously measured monthly average carbon dioxide levels exceeding 400 ppm in several single locations. In 2012, for example, the monthly average at the NOAA observatory in Barrow, Alaska, exceeded 400 ppm for the first time. Then the agencys observatory in Mauna Loa, Hawaii, reported that its monthly average CO2 level had exceeded 400 parts per million in April 2014. These earlier records, which were reported extensively, were based on observations from single locations while the NOAA monthly global average is based on data from 40 different sites. So Whitehouse seems to have been off a bit with his description of the monthly CO2 data. But what about human history? The senators spokesman, Seth Larson, referred us to ice-core data from Antarctica.  Scientists take core samples in Greenland and Antarctica and study the CO2 level of air bubbles — some of which have been trapped in the ice for hundreds of thousands of years. Data from Carbon Dioxide Information Analysis Center, which serves as the primary climate-change data hub of the U.S Department of Energy, show carbon dioxide concentrations ranging between 170 and 300 parts per million over the last 800,000 years. That more than covers Whitehouses in-human-history claim as humans have only been around for about 200,000, according to the Smithsonian Museum of Natural History. Before we closed the book on this one, we contacted Anthony Watts, an often-quoted global-warming skeptic. Watts claimed Whitehouse was wrong and cited the individual monthly data and a 2005 article in Nature that he said challenged the senators statement. We tracked down the lead author of the Nature, Swedish scientist Anders Moberg, and asked him about the Watts challenge. Impossible, Moberg said, explaining that his study was about temperatures in 1100 AD to 1150 AD — not carbon dioxide. For CO2 data, Moberg and John King, an oceanography professor at URI, pointed us to the ice-core research, the same data cited by Whitehouses office. The ice core records would support the Senator's statement, said King. The highest natural levels are around 300 ppm. Our ruling In his 100th speech on global warming on May 18, Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse said: This March, for the first time in human history, the monthly average carbon dioxide in our atmosphere exceeded 400 parts per million. The range had been 170-300 parts per million for hundreds of thousands of years. He probably could have been more precise if he had used the phrase global average, because there have been times when the monthly average exceed 400 parts per million at observation sites in Alaska and Hawaii. Beyond that small point, Whitehouse and his staff were on solid ground. (If you have a claim youd like PolitiFact Rhode Island to check, email us at emailprotected.

Chris Christie warns theyll become ravenous. Thats why Christie told a crowd in New Hampshire they should vote on Nov. 6 for Ovide Lamontagne, the Republican candidate for governor of the Granite State. Otherwise New Hampshire, which doesnt tax wages, may go the way of New Jersey.Christie said 35 years ago New Jersey also didnt have an income tax, but then Governor Brendan Byrne, a Democrat, said if you just give me a small income tax, just a little one, I will lower your property taxes, for the people who have the highest property taxes in America back in 1977. So 35 years later, what have we got? We still have the highest property taxes in America and the income tax that started at 2 percent under Governor Byrne is now 9 percent -- 9 percent.Here's the key everybody: you let a liberal politician in the door and give them permission to give you a new tax, they only know one direction for that tax to go and that's up, Christie said at the Sept. 25 event.Did New Jerseys income tax more than quadruple since it was first enacted, as Christie said?The governors statement is partially accurate because a group of individuals -- those earning more than $500,000 in taxable income -- are now subject to a statutory income tax rate of 8.97 percent.But those individuals represent only a small percentage of filers in New Jersey and the tax rates are lower for other income levels. The governors office did not respond to requests for comment, but the history of the states income tax is clear.In 1976 -- during Byrnes first term -- the state passed a temporary income tax with two rates. A 2 percent rate was levied on income less than $20,000 or about $80,000 in todays dollars, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. Income in excess of $20,000 was taxed at the top rate of 2.5 percent. A year after the temporary tax was enacted, the state made it permanent. Over time New Jersey modeled its income tax into a more progressive system, which now has rates ranging from 1.4 percent to 8.97 percent depending on income level and filing status.The states top rate is 8.97 percent, which only applies to income in excess of $500,000. Less than 2 percent of taxable New Jersey resident returns in 2009 had that level of income, according to state Treasury Department data. An individual with taxable income between $75,000 and $500,000 pays a 6.37 percent rate on that income. For income between $40,000 and $75,000, the rate is about 5.5 percent.The lowest rates are 1.4 percent and 1.75 percent, which are lower than the states rates in 1976. Those rates apply to incomes below $20,000 or between $20,000 and $35,000, respectively.So for Christie to suggest the income tax, in general, jumped from 2 percent to 9 percent is misleading. Thats true for one income level, but the statement oversimplifies New Jerseys current income tax system.Our rulingChristie said, The income tax that started at 2 percent under Governor Byrne is now 9 percent.When the state first implemented an income tax in 1976, two rates existed -- 2 percent for income less than $20,000 and 2.5 percent for income more than $20,000 -- but the state has since introduced a more progressive tax system. New Jerseys top rate is nearly 9 percent now, but applies only to taxable income above $500,000.Every other income bracket is subject to a rate lower than 9 percent, with some income levels charged a rate of less than 2 percent.To comment on this ruling, go to NJ.com.

False Confidence (between 0 and 1): 0.0",Says Central Texas river water sent to downstream rice farmers in 2011 equaled about three years worth of Austins water use.,"Austin-area residents worried about drought might rue an agencys 2011 decision to let thousands of gallons of water from the Highland Lakes flow past the capital to downstream farmers, the head of the Austin Water Utility said. A May 27, 2014, news story said: Massive releases of water to rice farmers downstream that greatly reduced lake levels in 2011, the single driest year in Central Texas history, didnt help either. The story--by StateImpact Texas, a collaboration of KUT Austin and KUHF Houston--then quoted Greg Meszaros, the utilitys director, as saying: Comparison-wise, about three years worth of Austins water use was sent to rice farmers that year. That much? Asked the basis of Meszaros comparison, utility spokesman Daryl Slusher referred to annual reports on water use from the Lower Colorado River Authority, which oversees water releases from the chain of man-made lakes along the Colorado River running through Austin: Buchanan, Inks, LBJ, Marble Falls, Travis and Austin. By email, Slusher said the reports show that in 2011, the latest year the authority sent water downstream to rice farmers, the provided water was three times the amount of water used by Austin in 2011, 2012 or 2013. According to the authoritys March 30, 2012, report on water use in 2011, the authority that year released 529,580 acre-feet in water for downstream agricultural purposes, including rice farming. That broke down to 433,251 acre-feet let go from the Highland Lakes plus 96,329 acre-feet of water used by farmers from the river alone, the report says. An acre-foot, 325,851 gallons, is roughly equal to the water used by three average Austin households in a year. And the 529,580 acre-feet of water that went to farmers compares to Austin using 168,334 acre-feet of water that year, the report states, including 61,712 acre-feet diverted from the Colorado River at Lake Austin and 106,622 acre-feet obtained from the Highland Lakes under a city contract with the authority. This result suggests the water released to farmers was equal to a little more than three times what Austin used that year. Also, Slusher pointed out that according to the authority, Austin used less water in 2012 (151,495 acre-feet) and even less again (142,027 acre-feet) in 2013, widening the 3-to-1 ratio for those years. Another way to suss Meszaros claim, Slusher wrote, lies in adding up the last three years worth of Austins water use, which gets us 461,856 acre-feet, or 13 percent less than the 529,580 acre-feet released to farmers in 2011. Our ruling Meszaros said billions of gallons of river water released to downstream rice farmers in 2011 equaled about three years worth of Austins water use. Equaled or exceeded is the long and short of it. TRUE – The statement is accurate and theres nothing significant missing.

Chris Christie said he faced down the impossible when he took office.The Republican governor told an audience at the Republican National Convention during his keynote address Tuesday night that despite the doubts of naysayers, he steered New Jersey off a path that we could no longer afford to follow.Now they said it was impossible this is what they told me to cut taxes in a state where taxes were raised 115 times in eight years. That it was impossible to balance a budget at the same time, with an $11 billion deficit. But three years later, we have three balanced budgets with lower taxes, Christie said. We did it.Here, well assess the governors claim that he balanced a budget with an $11 billion deficit.New Jerseys Constitution requires a balanced budget every year. Christie has met that obligation in every budget year.The major flaw with the governors claim is that the deficit he cites never went away. And Christie now dismisses that deficit calculation as the old way of budgeting.The $11 billion refers to a $10.7 billion structural deficit the states nonpartisan Office of Legislative Service projected for the fiscal 2011 budget year, when Christie proposed his first spending plan.A structural deficit measures how much money the state would need if current services and revenues remained the same and all spending obligations required by statute were fully funded.But the state does not have to meet all of its obligations since the budget supersedes statute.So although a state statute may require certain levels of spending on different programs, the governor can sign a budget that does otherwise.And thats largely what Christie did in his first budget.The governor skipped a $3.1 billion pension payment. He didnt fully fund the school aid formula. He didnt fully fund the states property tax rebate program.And the next budget year, the state still had a projected structural deficit.For the fiscal 2012 budget year, OLS projected a structural deficit of about $10.5 billion, nearly the same size as the previous fiscal year.But Christie then dismissed that calculation, calling it the old way of budgeting.In a budget speech last year, Christie said the projected deficit assumes no one is actually managing the budget or setting priorities. That is yesterdays New Jersey.Now, Christie said, the baseline is zero for budgeting.Our rulingChristie said naysayers said it was impossible to balance a budget at the same time, with an $11 billion deficit and we did it.The state Constitution requires a balanced budget every year and Christie met that obligation.The deficit figure Christie cites refers to a $10.7 billion projected structural deficit, a calculation Christie uses to his advantage in his first budget year but has since dismissed as the old way of budgeting.Thats important context Christies statement lacks.

But he also took credit for his signature health care law.Already, the Affordable Care Act is helping to slow the growth of health care costs, he said.From our previous fact-checking, we know that many of the major provisions of the 2010 health care law have yet to take effect. So how can the law already be slowing the growth of health care costs? We decided to check it out.Slowing spendingAs Obama made his speech, the White House posted slides on its website to back up Obamas key points.For his health care comment, a chart showed Medicare spending projections from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, both before the passage of the Affordable Care Act and afterward. The chart shows the future growth noticeably slowing after the laws passage. (View the chart here.) The numbers were part of the CBO's regular update on the countrys economic outlook and the federal budget. We reviewed the latest numbers, which were released on Feb. 5, 2013, as well as news coverage of the findings.In its report, the CBO says that health care spending has grown much more slowly in recent years, both for federal programs and overall, than it did in previous years. In response to that slowing growth, the CBO reduced its projections for future Medicare spending. Since March 2010, the CBO has lowered its projections for Medicare spending in 2020 by roughly 15 percent, the report said.However, the CBO did not specifically credit the Affordable Care Act as the reason for lowering the projections. Some aspects of the law, the report said, will slightly increase federal outlays in Medicare and Medicaid.But the CBO did say it was revising estimates based on actual reduced growth in health care spending since at least 2010.Health care law phasing inAs we noted above, the health care law isnt fully in effect yet. A new requirement for Americans to get health insurance or pay a penalty won't take effect until 2014, for example.For the Medicare program, the law includes both spending and cost savings.Beneficiaries can now receive expanded prescription drug coverage and preventive care without co-pays under the law; but those benefits increase costs.On the other hand, the law has also put in place limits on payments to private insurance companies that operate the Medicare Advantage program, which saves money. Changes in payments to hospitals have also already started. That means financial incentives for hospitals that are more efficient and penalties for those that are not.When we asked White House staff for more evidence to support Obamas comments, they pointed us to a January memo from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, which specifically pointed to limits on Medicare Advantage and changes to hospital payments.Finally, a controversial Medicare payments commission -- the Independent Payment Advisory Board -- would make recommendations to make payments more efficient, reducing spending. But that board hasnt yet convened, and it may never convene if Medicare meets pre-determined budget targets.Trends in health care spendingGetting back to health care costs, its clear that the growth in spending is going down, both for overall health spending and Medicare. But whats driving it? We found that experts consider it something of an interesting puzzle.Some blame the recession and the economy. When people feel poor, they dont spend as much, even on health care. Under this scenario, health care spending will rebound when the economy is better.Others say the overall health care system is changing, moving away from payments for each procedure and test, and moving toward payments for better overall outcomes. The health care law includes provisions to encourage that switch. If this is the case, reduced spending growth should become permanent.We found a diversity of opinion on whats going on here, and whether Obamas comment was accurate.Medicare spending slowed down in 2010-12, so this is not just a projection, said Jonathan Oberlander, a professor of health policy at the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill. Much of the law is not yet implemented, yet some Affordable Care Act provisions to control Medicare spending -- like changes in what Medicare Advantage plans are paid -- are already in effect, and were expected to produce savings during 2011-12.Other experts are dubious that the law is having much effect at all, such as Yuval Levin, a fellow at the Ethics and Public Policy Center and a domestic policy staffer on health care issues for President George W. Bush.The reduction in overall health costs has had above all to do with the weak economy, and while CBO does suggest that its projections of the effects of the Affordable Care Act have changed in a few ways since it passed in 2010 (causing both upward and downward revisions of the effects on costs), those are all projections for after 2014, when the key substantive provisions of the law will take effect, he said. None of them could be used to suggest that already, the Affordable Care Act is helping to slow the growth of health care costs.The Obama administration argues that its more than a weak economy driving reductions in spending. The economic recession may have contributed to the 2010-12 decrease in growth in per beneficiary spending as consumers use less care due to its cost, says the HHS memo. However, as almost all Medicare beneficiaries have supplemental coverage and thus face relatively low out-of-pocket costs, it seems unlikely that consumer behavior alone is responsible for the slow growth in Medicare spending.Deborah Chollet, a senior fellow at Mathematica Policy Research, said the health care system is responding to the new law already. Insurance companies and other payers know about the new payment methods the law supports, and they are planning accordingly, she said.Its really not at all a situation of the lights turning on Jan. 1, 2014. The lights have been on for the past six months, she said.Still, determining causes behind the spending slowdown is no easy task, warned Bradley Herring, professor at the Bloomberg School of Public Health at Johns Hopkins University.I think most people think the slowdown weve seen in health care spending over the last three years has been due to the recession. But no ones 100 percent sure why that happened, he said.Things will get even more complicated for health policy researchers as the law deploys changes to payments and other pilot programs. Researchers will have to hypothesize how much costs decline compared with if the law had not passed.Those are going to be difficult things to measure, Herring said.Well close with comments from Douglas Elmendorf, head of the Congressional Budget Office. He spoke to reporters when the office released new numbers on Feb. 5:So, health spending has grown slowly over the past few years, both in federal programs and in the rest of the health care systems. We think that part of that owes to the recession and the loss of income in wealth, but we think that a significant part of that probably does not stem from the recession, probably arises from structural changes in the health care system.The critical question is, whether those structural changes are very transitory changes or whether they will persist. We're doing analysis to that question. We're talking with outside experts who are also investigating the same question. I think the short summary of that is that we don't know.Our rulingObama said, Already, the Affordable Care Act is helping to slow the growth of health care costs.Hes right that health care costs are slowing, but theres not conclusive evidence that the law is helping. The nonpartisan reports from the Congressional Budget Office dont specifically say that, and some aspects of the health law translate to increased spending.Among health care experts, we found debate over how much the Affordable Care Act is contributing to an overall slowdown in health spending. Some argue that the recession is making people spend less on health care. Others say the health care system is changing to become more efficient. Many say that more study is needed.Obamas taking credit for more than he can prove.",0.7,0.3,0.85,0.9681175615

Tom Coburn said that under President Obama, all the health care in this country is eventually going to be run by the government, it was like a golden oldie PolitiFact has heard many times before. During the campaign, we heard the same tune from vice presidential candidateSarah Palin, who said Obama was calling for a government-run plan;Mitt Romney, who said Obama wants the government to take over health care; andRudy Giuliani, who called Hillary Clinton's similar plan socialized medicine.) Coburn, an Oklahoma Republican, made his remarks while criticizing Obama on a different matter. Obama is moving to rescind Bush administration rules that protected medical workers from performing procedures such as abortion that conflicted with their religious or moral beliefs. Coburn, who is against abortion, said rescinding the order would be only a first step for the Obama administration. Remember, under the Obama plan . . . all the health care in this country is eventually going to be run by the government, Coburn said in an interview on Fox News on March 4, 2009. So it's part of an incremental creep towards eliminating any objection, both as us as taxpayers and then individual physicians in terms of not complying with a government-run bureaucracy, he added. Coburn and Obama can fairly disagree about conscience protections for health care workers who oppose abortions. But he's wrong that Obama's plan offers government-run health care. In fact, Obama's plan leaves in place the private health care system, but seeks to expand it to the uninsured. It increases eligibility for the poor and children to enroll in initiatives like Medicaid and the State Childrens Health Insurance Program, and creates pools for individuals to buy their own cheaper insurance. It also outlines strategies to rein in costs for everyone, such as electronic medical records and preventive care. I think most of us would agree that if we want to cover all Americans, we can't make the mistake of trying to fix what isn't broken, Obama said at a health care conference he hosted on March 5. So if somebody has insurance they like, they should be able to keep that insurance. If they have a doctor that they like, they should be able to keep their doctor. They should just pay less for the care that they receive. Would Obama's plan result in closer regulation of the health care system? Very likely so. It includes provisions that require health insurance companies to cover pre-existing conditions and disclose more information about how they treat patients. Obama's plan also calls for evidence-based health care standards, so that government can stop paying (through programs like Medicare) for treatments that don't get good results. But the plan is very different from some European-style health systems where the government owns health clinics and employs doctors. We asked Coburn's office about his remarks. What matters is not just President Obamas intent, or what his plan states, but the likely effect and consequences of his plan, said spokesman John Hart. Under Obamas approach, the only plans left standing will be those controlled by the government. That may be Sen. Coburn's opinion on what could happen, but it's definitely not part of Obama's plan. And Coburn was very specific in saying that under the Obama plan, all the health care in this country is eventually going to be run by the government. That gives the incorrect impression that Obama is promoting a government-run health care system. He's not.",0.2,0.8,0.8,0.8368366502

In February, Gov. Tony Evers, a Democrat, proposed a $91 billion spending plan for 2021-23, seeking to expand Medicaid, roll back Act 10-era collective bargaining limits, legalize marijuana and raise the minimum wage -- among scores of other items intended to put the state back on its feet after the coronavirus pandemic. On May 6, 2021, the Republican-controlled Joint Finance Committee stripped nearly 400 items from Evers budget, with the co-chairs saying it included a tremendous amount of excessive spending, pet projects, tax increases and divisive non-fiscal policy. Democrats say Evers budget would fix long-standing problems in the state and honor measures that are widely popular with voters. But Republicans say their plan would keep Wisconsinites from facing a higher tax burden. Theyve also argued that the governors budget would send the states general fund back into a deficit based on a common accounting standard, after its 2019-21 budget created the first positive balance by that standard that the general fund had seen since 2000. Staff of Sen. Howard Marklein, R-Spring Green, created a chart showing as much that several members of the Republican caucus have shared on social media. Is the claim correct? Lets dig in. The chart cited depicts Wisconsins general fund deficit dating back to 2000, at which time the deficit totaled around $1 billion based on Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, or GAAP. The line peaks in fiscal year 2010-11, when the general fund deficit was nearly $3 billion, by this measure. In 2020, the chart shows a negative deficit — or rather, a positive general fund balance. An arrow then indicates that Evers proposed 2021-23 budget would return the general fund to a deficit. Gov. Evers budget is a bounce back to larger GAAP deficits, Sen. Duey Stroebel, R-Saukville, tweeted along with the chart on April 7, 2021. Adam Gibbs, communications director for the office of Senate Majority Leader Devin LeMahieu, R-Oostburg, provided an analysis from the nonpartisan Legislative Fiscal Bureau that bears some of the claim out. The analysis, which Marklein requested in December 2019, indeed shows the states general fund had been in deficit since 2000, with the largest — $2.99 billion — during fiscal year 2010-11. It ends with fiscal year 2017-18, at a $1.25 billion deficit. The general fund deficit for the following year is detailed in Wisconsins Comprehensive Annual Financial Report. In 2019, it was just under $800 million in deficit. In 2020, the tide turned and the general fund reached $1.5 million under those standard accounting principles, according to the Comprehensive Annual Financial Report for the fiscal year ending June 30. At the time, Evers credited his government for working on issues important to Wisconsinites without running up the states credit card. It was the first time Wisconsin had reached a positive GAAP fund balance since the state began issuing the comprehensive annual financial reports, he said. Evers 2021-23 budget in brief, released in February 2021, outlines a return to the general fund deficit over the next two years. In 2021, the estimated closing GAAP fund balance is still positive, at about $921 million. In 2022, its estimated at a deficit of nearly $2 million. In 2023, the estimated deficit is about $938 million. This deficit doesnt mean the states budget isnt balanced — in fact, Wisconsin is required by law to pass a balanced budget where estimated revenues are at least equal to estimated expenditures. The GAAP system, however, counts future expenditures at the time that the state commits to spending on them, even if they wont be paid until the next budget cycle. The states other method of accounting, called cash modified accrual, doesnt count expenditures until it comes time to pay them. Members of the states Republican caucus claim that Evers proposed budget would return the state to a GAAP fund deficit, after its first positive balance in the fund in decades in the biennium prior. The Legislative Fiscal Bureau analysis shows the funds deficit through fiscal year 2018, and the states annual financial report shows it turning around in 2020. In the Department of Administrations estimation of the next two years, the deficit would return in 2022 and persist through 2023.  ",1,0,1,0.8539417687

On Nov. 30, 2015, the first day of the United Nations gathering, Will made a two-part claim that we want to check. He made the statement on Fox News Special Report, and it was replayed the next day by Milwaukee radio talk show host Charlie Sykes, whose guests are nearly always fellow conservatives. Despite 30 years of propaganda about global warming, Will stated, fewer Americans carpool today to work than carpooled in 1980. SUVs have never been a larger proportion of the vehicles being sold in this country. The American people may profess occasionally to be concerned about global warming, but their behavior tells you that none of this propaganda has had any effect. The size of the cars Americans drive and how often they carpool are only two ways in which people produce greenhouse gases -- those such as carbon dioxide from vehicles that trap heat in the atmosphere and, scientists believe, contribute to global warming. But lets see how clean Wills claim is. Greenhouse gases A little first on greenhouse gases. When Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker stated in September 2015 that the Obama administrations own Environmental Protection Agency has said its Clean Power Plan will have a marginal impact on climate change (Half True), we noted that the United States and China are considered the worlds top greenhouse gas polluters. And as PolitiFact National reported the same month, the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has said it is extremely likely that humans are causing climate change, and very likely that greenhouses gases are the driver.  Weve also noted that according to the EPA, greenhouse gas emissions from vehicles in the United States amount to 27 percent of all sources of greenhouse gases, second only to electric power generation. Now to the first part of Wills claim. Carpooling The latest census figures show that slightly more than 9 percent of Americans carpooled to work in 2014. As Will suggested, thats down from nearly 20 percent in 1980, which was the first census to survey about carpooling. Driving alone rose from 64.4 percent to 76.5 percent. Among the reasons, according to experts: The rate of car ownership has risen, work schedules are less predictable, more people work from home and busier Americans want more freedom in managing their commutes with other tasks, such as getting kids to soccer practice. The other part of Wills statement, however, goes off road a bit. SUVs Well note that, strictly speaking, there are traditional sport-utility vehicles, such as the Jeep Grand Cherokee and Dodge Durango, which are built on a truck platform; and the newer crossover-utility vehicles, which are built on a car chassis. They include the Honda CR-V and the Buick Encore. Traditional SUVs peaked with a 17 percent market share in 2002, according to the Ann Arbor, Mich.-based Center for Automotive Research, an independent research group. In 2014, they made up only 7.1 percent of all new vehicle sales. But many people, as well as automotive experts, refer to both types of vehicles simply as SUVs. The car site Edmunds.com told us that SUVs have reached their highest-ever market share in 2015, at 35.5 percent of sales. And the Center for Automotive Research provided us similar figures. In 2014, traditional SUVs and crossovers accounted for 34 percent of new-vehicle sales, as high as any year going back to 1995. Our rating Will said that despite attention on global warming, fewer Americans carpool today to work than carpooled in 1980 and SUVs have never been a larger proportion of the vehicles being sold in this country. Will is correct on carpooling to work and essentially correct on SUVs, when taking into account both traditional SUVs and the smaller crossover vehicles. But its worth noting that the market share for the traditional SUVs is down from its peak in 2002. ",0.9,0.15,1,0.5241949514

What's become of America since President Obama took full control of Washington? the narrator says. A wrecked economy, with debt and waste beyond imagination. Since then, gas prices have gone up more than 82 percent. Every single day, more than 1,500 of our jobs have been lost. Every day, another 2,700 of us realize it's been six months since we last had a job. Every day, more than 6,000 of us have begun living below poverty, while 13,000 more have been put on food stamps, and more than 800 have become uninsured.  This is the legacy President Obama and his Democrats have left for us. If we give them more time, what else will they do to America? Theres a lot to digest here, but were going to look at two claims from the ad. The one were looking at in this item is, Since President Obama took full control of Washington  every single day, more than 1,500 of our jobs have been lost. As we do with claims like this, we split our analysis into two parts. Are the numbers right? And is it fair to assess either credit or blame for those numbers to the target of the ad? First, the numbers. We turned to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the federal governments official source for employment figures. We first looked at total, nonfarm employment between January 2009, when Obama was sworn in, until December 2011, the most recent month available at the time the ad was released. We also used the figure that would have been available at the time the ad was released. Often BLS adjusts numbers upwards or downwards in the succeeding month, based on additional information. Using the preliminary numbers, a net 1,661,000 jobs were lost nationwide. Assuming that three years means 1,095 days -- or 365 times 3 -- then 1,517 net jobs were lost per day during that period. So, using that measurement, the ad is correct. (Using the revised numbers released after the ad came out, the daily number dropped significantly -- to 1,274 -- due to stronger-than-expected job growth.) But thats if you start the count in January 2009. Since Obama was sworn in on Jan. 20, 2009, February was actually his first full month in office -- and using the February numbers makes a big difference. Starting with February 2009, the net number of jobs lost was 937,000, which produces a daily job loss of 856, or 43 percent lower than the amount claimed in the ad. (If you look only at private-sector jobs, the daily job loss was even smaller -- 303 jobs, a number that shrunk to just 74 once revised figures appeared.) The difference between starting in January or February is so big because the transition between President George W. Bush and Obama included months with some of the most rapid job losses of the entire recession, which began in December 2007. In just the one month from January 2009 to February 2009, for instance, the economy lost a net 725,000 jobs. Even spread over three years, adding just that one extra month to the calculation means adding 660 additional job losses per day. Next, does Obama deserve the blame? Weve consistently ruled in the past that the economy is too complex to assign full blame (or credit) for job gains or losses to a president or a governor. Presidents, governors, and mayors can have an impact on job creation during their terms in office. Almost always, however, the impact is small in relation to the effects of events and trends over which elected officials have little control, especially in their first few years on the job, said Gary Burtless, an economist with the Brookings Institution. A recession that is under way or begins soon after a president or governor takes office is in no way the fault of the new officeholder. The flip side is that chief executives cannot claim much credit for a strong economic recovery that begins shortly before or after they take the oath of office. Of special note here is that this ad uses the formulation, since President Obama took full control of Washington. Obama -- or at least the Democrats -- can be said to have had full control of Washington, at least on a nominal basis, for two of those three years. But after the Republicans took over the House beginning in January 2011, they have had a share of the control as well. And we can rule out the possibility that the numbers were calculated based on just the two years when Obama had an entirely Democratic Congress, since the NRCC web page linking to the ad states, This video shows the daily economic pain endured by American workers and families due to President Obama and Washington Democrats' failed policies averaged over every day of the last three years. Our ruling Using the numbers available at the time -- which subsequently have been revised to be more favorable to the president -- and starting the count in January 2009, the ad is correct about the 1,500 jobs lost per day. But starting the count with Obamas first full month in office, which we think is an equally plausible way of doing it, reduces that number significantly, to 43 percent lower than what the ad claims. Meanwhile, economists tell us that the causes of these job losses are multiple, so it is also incorrect to attribute the blame solely to Obama.",0.7,0.6,0.9,0.7120286628

Online, some people are claiming that the crash wasnt an accident. We already debunked one Facebook post that suggested Bryant was murdered. Now, were looking at an Instagram post that claims Bryants death was planned. After LeBron James passes Kobe on the all time NBA scoring list, Kobes personal helicopter crashes only a day later, the Jan. 26 post says. LeBron has to hit the 33,644 point mark to pass Kobe Bryant & become the NBAs 3rd highest scorer in history. The 33 is significant. The 6 is significant. And Ive been speaking on the importance of the 44 ritual in pro sports for months now. To me, this looks like a ritual sacrifice in order for the LA Lakers to win their 17th championship, & for LeBron to get his 4th ring. I believe this was also a ritual sacrifice for the 49ers to win the Superbowl. It goes on about the significance of other numbers, like Bryants birthday, before concluding: This definitely makes me believe that his untimely death has been planned for a while now. This post was flagged as part of Facebooks efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) On Jan. 25, Los Angeles Laker LeBron James passed Bryants all-time scoring record. Playing against the Philadelphia 76ers that day, James finished with 29 points, bringing his career total to 33,655, according to the Washington Post. Bryant finished his career with 33,643. Bryant tweeted his congratulations that night: Continuing to move the game forward @KingJames. Much respect my brother #33644. But theres no evidence to suggest that Bryant, a former Lakers star, was killed in a ritual sacrifice, as the Instagram post claims. Rather, Bryants plane crashed in fog dense enough that the Los Angeles Police Department grounded its helicopters. National Transportation Safety Board investigators arrived in California after the incident, and the agency is working with the Federal Aviation Administration, the helicopters manufacturer and the company that made its engine to collect evidence about the crash, according to the Post. The investigation will look at weather data, radar information air traffic control communications, maintenance logs and the pilots record.",0.1,0.9,0.3,0.371073848

On taxes, Hovdes like Thompson, only worse.The ad shows a smiling Hovde at the start of a 2009 TV appearance as a financial pundit on CNBCs Squawk Box beneath the words: No Problem Raising Taxes.Hovde fired back with his own TV spot that calls the Neumann (actually Club for Growths) tax accusation false. (The campaign acknowledges Hovde gave $500 to Democrat Doyles re-election campaign in 2005. It has not explained why, but notes that Hovde has given almost exclusively to Republicans, and in much larger amounts.)So, did Hovdes remarks suggest he has no problem with raising taxes?We watched the nearly 11-minute discussion between Hovde and the cable shows hosts and found a brief exchange on taxes that closely -- but not exactly -- mirrors the language in the groups ad.The backgroundHovdes March 3, 2009 appearance on CNBC focused on the ongoing financial crisis and his criticisms of actions under both Republican President George W. Bush and newly elected President Barack Obama. Hovde said the country was in a depression, Obamas stimulus bill was unfocused and out of control federal spending was taking the country into quasi-Socialist territory.At the 7:25 mark of the segment, as the Journal Sentinels Dan Bice reported in April 2012, Hovde abruptly turned the talk to taxes, tax breaks and the Obama administration.Unprompted, he began: Look, I have no problem with me getting charged higher taxes. Ive been blessed in my life and Ive been very fortunate. But some of the things that theyve done are just insane.Then he referred to an Obama 2009 proposal to reduce the mortgage-interest tax deduction for households earning more than $250,000.Taking away deductions on home mortgage payments -- I dont need it, but a lot of other people do. Hovde said. Were in a housing recession -- are you kidding me?So, the Club for Growth claims Hovde said he had no problem with raising taxes. He actually said: I have no problem with me getting charged higher taxes.Thats a significant difference, especially since he immediately noted that eliminating housing deductions, for instance, would be unwise in a recession.The timing is also important.In 2009, Hovde was a private citizen, not a candidate running on a platform of what he would do if elected.An candidate can have a personal opinion on an issue but may decide to vote another way for a variety of reasons. For instance, a lawmaker personally would not seek an abortion but votes pro-choice to leave the decision up to the mother.Its also unclear from the 2009 CNBC interview exactly what Hovde was talking about. Did he mean paying more through a higher top tax rate? Through a repeal of the Bush tax cuts?When asked about the claim, the Club for Growth noted it would take a tax increase of some kind for Hovdes personal tax bill to rise.As a candidate in 2012, Hovde told Bice he was not referring to Obamas so-called Buffett Rule legislation to make sure high earners pay at least 30 percent in federal income tax (a bill sponsored by U.S. Rep. Tammy Baldwin, the Democratic candidate in the race).Hovde has said he was thinking of the tax break on carried interest -- the portion of a funds investment gains taken by fund managers (like Hovde) as compensation. It also applies to venture capitalists and private equity specialists.In an interview, Hovde agreed that it would be a tax increase for that narrow group. Some government estimates put the total at more than $1 billion a year.But lets look at his tax positions as a candidate in 2012.Hovde has pledged to reduce individual income tax rates across the board, drop the corporate income tax rate from 35 percent to 25 percent and eliminate the estate tax.So Hovde has made it clear he is against raising tax rates. In fact, he wants dramatic cuts in peoples tax bills.That leaves his support for eliminating tax deductions -- a move that would bring the government more revenue.Hovde says he would vote to eliminate nearly all of the deductions in the current tax code, which he sees as riddled with favors to big corporations at the expense of small businesses. He also thinks the individual tax code is too complicated.And he told us he still favors eliminating the carried interest tax provision, which he sees as eliminating a loophole.Hovde, who has made debt and deficit reduction a major theme, has told voters he would accept a budget-balancing deal that gets $10 in spending cuts for every $1 in new revenue through the elimination of loopholes or deductions.He told us his strong preference would be that such a deal include cuts in the tax rates.He said he would consider supporting a 10-to-1 deal that holds rates steady instead of lowering them, depending on which loopholes or deductions are removed.But does that constitute a tax increase?Even conservative Republicans disagree on this. Americans for Tax Reforms widely publicized taxpayer protection pledge frowns on deduction eliminations unless the new revenue is completely offset by lower rates. Thompson and Neumann have signed that pledge, but Hovde has not. A leading conservative in the Senate, Republican Tom Coburn of Oklahoma, has criticized the groups pledge as too narrow to allow for smart reform of the tax code.PolitiFact National consulted a range of experts in January 2012 in evaluating a Mitt Romney claim that Obama has raised taxes 19 times.Views differed on some issues, but the consensus was that eliminating or limiting such deductions as those for prescription or other medical expenses clearly deserved the label of tax increases.Donald Marron, director of the Tax Policy Center, told us its case by case -- some of these tax preferences are best seen as taxes, but others as spending programs in disguise.Given Hovdes pledge to wipe out nearly all deductions, it seems clear that some of those moves could be labeled as tax increases. Even Hovde acknowledged eliminating the carried interest provision would be a tax increase for a narrow group.Our conclusionThe national Club for Growth used Hovdes own words from a cable TV interview in 2009 to frame him as in favor of raising taxes.Hovde said what he said -- he would pay more, which put him on record as open to some kind of tax increase. Theres no other way to read it.But the ad takes the 2009 comment and alters it in a subtle but significant way, changing the context. By also changing the timing, leaving viewers thinking Hovde is campaigning in 2012 on a plan to raise taxes, the issue is further distorted.In the current campaign, Hovde has made it clear he wants dramatically lower taxes and would not raise rates, while staying open to a net revenue increase from loophole elimination as part of a massive spending-and-tax-cut deal. That doesnt square with the breezy portrayal of Hovde as having no problem raising taxes.The Truth-O-Meter says Mostly False claims have an element of truth but ignore critical facts that would give a different impression.We think that fits the Club for Growth ad claim.

Then theres the bill about feral cats. Dont call them feral cats, though. Bills in the Legislature are re-branding them with a more user-friendly name: community cats. Not so fast, say the bird lovers. The American Bird Conservancy is crying fowl, er foul. The bills would authorize the public hoarding of cats by feral cat activists, in the face of potential public health and property value impacts, as well as predicted high mortality for native animals, the groups said in a press release. The conservancy says passage of two bills (HB 1121/SB 1320) would make it easier for people to dump unwanted cats in areas where they roam aplenty. This is shocking, said Grant Sizemore, the conservancys Cats Indoors program manager. Hoarding of animals in homes is prohibited in most places, but we now have Florida encouraging it in public places such as city parks. There is no question that the health of local citizenry -- including children -- is being put at risk, property values in the hoarding areas will be impacted and local wildlife will continue to be devastated. PolitiFact Florida wanted to research whether this bill would allow cat hoarding. The cat bills The Community Cats legislation, sponsored by Rep. Holly Raschein, R-Key Largo, and Sen. Darren Soto, D-Orlando, attempts to rein in cat overpopulation. Several communities have established programs to spay and care for feral cats and release them, however there were concerns among some involved in such programs that the release of cats would constitute abandonment and violate state animal cruelty laws. The bill amends the states animal cruelty law to state that someone who spays or neuters a feral cat and then releases it is not abandoning the cat or breaking the law. The bill also states that counties and cities can still adopt their own ordinances to curtail the feral cat population. The bill defines a community cat as an outdoor, free-roaming cat that lacks visible owner identification and defines a community cat owner as someone who gives that cat food or water. Cat and wildlife activists have been battling each other about how to handle feral cats for years. A 2003 Tampa Bay Times article described a cat vs. rat battle at the Ocean Reef Club, an exclusive community of multimillion-dollar homes near a state park and wildlife refuge. Homeowners set up a program to take care of hundreds of stray cats, but meanwhile the populations of the Key Largo wood rat and cotton mouse, both endangered, dwindled. Wildlife experts pointed fingers at the cats. It's a very serious problem for Key Largo wood rats, University of Florida wildlife scientist Frank Mazzotti said at the time. Releasing a feral cat in a natural area is like releasing a serial murderer in a maternity ward. Central to the bill debate is whether programs that encourage the trap, neuter and release of feral cats reduce the feral cat population and the dangers to wildlife and humans. A study by scientists including from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service estimated that cats kill up to 3.7 billion birds a year, and found no connection between the programs (called TNR) and fewer bird deaths. Claims that TNR colonies are effective in reducing cat populations, and, therefore, wildlife mortality, are not supported by peer-reviewed scientific studies, it said. A 2003 Florida International University study concluded that TNR cat programs at two parks encouraged illegal dumping of cats and led to a population increase at one park, while the other remained stable. The Florida Department of Health, which remains neutral on the cat bill, stated in a 2012 rabies prevention report that managing feral cats is not tenable on public health grounds because of the persistent threat posed to communities from injury and disease. Bill supporters point to a study published in the journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association that concluded a TNR program at the University of Central Florida reduced the population. They also point to this research about the benefits of vaccinating cats. Would this lead to hoarding? So there is evidence that feral cats carry diseases and kill wildlife. But would this bill allow animal hoarding? A spokeswoman for the Humane Society, a group supporting the bill, said bill opponents are misusing the word hoarding. Animal hoarding is a serious mental illness, Humane society spokeswoman Katie Lisnik told PolitiFact. It is a severe case of neglect and abuse of animals. Thats different from programs that care for cats, she said. Hoarding -- generally speaking, not exclusively to animals -- will be listed by the American Psychiatric Associations Diagnostic and statistical Manual for the first time this year, said Smith College psychology professor Randy Frost who studies hoarding. We asked Frost if Floridas bill could lead to increased hoarding. I dont know that there is any way to tell, he said. I think it would be hard to hoard in a field or public place. ... I dont know of many cases of hoarding where hoarding occurred in public. Id have to think about that. Brevard County recently placed a moratorium on registration for cat colonies -- county officials know of several hundred colonies. Bob Brown, captain of enforcement for Brevard County animal services, said he doesnt think he would call these cat colonies hoarding. In a cat colony, they have no control if the cat comes or goes. Usually cat hoarders want to keep things confined within their control. An outdoor colony is different than the homes where there are cat urine stains all over the walls or cat feces dripping out of cabinets. Weve seen some real doozies, he said. Robert Johns, a spokesman with the bird conservancy, said the law removes penalties for people who abandon animals to public places.  Instead of having a hoard of cats in a house, which is illegal in many places, we would simply have dozens or hundreds of them outdoors in many places, essentially taking over public land to be used by feral cats, he said. Our ruling The American Bird Conservancy said a bill would authorize the public hoarding of cats by feral cat activists. The bill would authorize people to neuter and release feral cats. But its difficult to predict how these future cat colonies will be managed and controlled by local ordinances. Is it possible that someone could hoard feral cats outdoors? Sure. But animal hoarders typically want to be able to control their cats, so thats why they hoard inside their own homes. The research we reviewed about feral cats focused on numbers, health problems and threats to wildlife they pose -- not whether it constitutes hoarding. That could be because hoarding isnt the central debate about these feral cats, but it is a heated word that draws attention.",0.6,0.4,0.9,0.5887016267

Greg Abbott was among governors declaring they would not accept Syrian refugees because of a potential for terrorism. Abbott appeared on The Real Story, a Fox News program, on Nov.17, 2015, to explain his stance on keeping refugees out of Texas because of security concerns. We've had three ISIS-related incidents already and now with the possible connection of one of the Syrian refugees being involved in the terrorist attack in Paris, Abbott said, Texas is saying 'no more.  We wondered whether Texas was really the site of so many ISIS plots. Abbott spokesman John Wittman pointed us to a letter from Abbott to Obama dated Nov. 16, 2015, which said: The threat posed to Texas by ISIS is very real. ISIS claimed credit last May when two terrorist gunmen launched an attack in Garland, Texas. Less than two weeks later, the FBI arrested an Iraqi-born man in North Texas and charged him with lying to federal agents about traveling to Syria to fight with ISIS. The letter went on to say that in 2014, when I served as Texas attorney general, we participated in a Joint Terrorism Task Force that arrested two Austin residents for providing material support to terrorists -- including ISIS. To determine if Abbott got his facts straight, we looked at each of the incidents. An Austin-area arrest and conviction Some of this was old ground for us. In September 2014, when Abbott was the state attorney general also running for governor, he claimed hed been involved in prosecuting a terrorist member of ISIS. We found that claim False; Abbott offered no evidence to back up his declaration aside from a press release crediting a range of agencies including the attorney general as well as the Killeen Police Department and Texas Alcoholic Beverage Commission. Abbotts statement also relied on a broad definition of terrorist and ISIS member. A federal complaint indicated Michael Todd Wolfe of Austin may have sought to be those things. But the complaint didnt confirm hed become a terrorist or ISIS member. In the case in question, Wolfe and Rahatul Khan of Round Rock, Texas, were charged with attempting to provide material support to terrorists. Wolfe had tried to board an international flight out of George Bush Intercontinental Airport that would take him to the first stop on a planned journey to Syria. In June 2015, Wolfe was sentenced to seven years in prison for attempting to provide material support to terrorists. According to the criminal complaint, Khan attempted to recruit an undercover FBI agent to a terrorist cell over the Internet. He was sentenced to 10 years imprisonment. The pipeline was affiliated with al-Shabaab — the al-Qaeda-linked Somali militant group behind the mass slaying of Christian students at a Kenyan university earlier this year—not ISIS. Abbotts second described incident In his 2015 letter to Obama, Abbott also referenced concerns about Bilal Abood, the Iraqi-born man in North Texas. Court documents show Abood migrated to the United States in 2009, and offer the following account of his subsequent movement and activities: On March 29, 2013, FBI agents prevented Abood from boarding a flight at Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport. He told them he was planning to visit family. Interviewed a second time five days later, Abood said his intent was to join the Free Syrian Army (FSA) in the struggle against Bashar al-Assad, the president of Syria. Later in April 2013, Abood travelled to Turkey via Mexico, on or about April 29. Agents again interviewed Abood upon his return to the United States on Sept. 16, 2013. He admitted he had travelled to Syria and stayed in an FSA camp, but denied financially supporting any terrorist group. A search of Aboods computer in July 2014 found that he had tweeted a pledge of allegiance to Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the leader of ISIS, on June 19, 2014. He later denied pledging allegiance to ISIS and was arrested for making a materially false, fictitious and fraudulent statement and representation, in a matter within the jurisdiction of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Abbotts letter mischaracterizes the nature of Aboods offense; he wrote that Abood was charged with lying to federal agents about traveling to Syria to fight with ISIS, not lying about a tweet. Shootings in Garland The third incident referenced by Abbott was the Garland, Texas, shooting scheme attempted by Elton Simpson and Nadir Soofi on May 5, 2015. According to a criminal complaint the FBI later filed against a Florida man who claimed to have encouraged the attack, the two planned to shoot attendees at a contest centered around cartoons of the prophet Muhammad (drawing the prophet Muhammad is forbidden in Islam). However, they were shot and killed outside the event by police. This incident is the only foiled attack included in a Department Homeland Security analysis of all ISIS-related arrests on United States soil from January 2014 to September 2015 (the other cases were unsuccessful and successful attempts to travel to fight with ISIS, provide material support to ISIS, and engage in early stage aspirational attack planning). In the aftermath of the shooting, ISIS claimed credit. However, by the time Abbott made his claim, investigators had yet to issue any statement characterizing the Garland attack as having been ordered by members of ISIS. Simpson was involved in terrorist causes before ISIS even split off from Al-Qaeda. He was arrested by the FBI in 2010 after discussing jihad and potential travel to Somalia with an informant the previous year. Allison Mahan, an FBI spokeswoman in Dallas, told us via email, The Garland attackers were ISIS-inspired and the investigation is ongoing. ISIS-inspired terrorist attacks are much more common than attacks directly ordered by members of the group, according to an analysis published in the October 2015 issue of the Terrorism Research Initiatives Perspectives on Terrorism. The TRI is an international consortium of scholars founded in 2007 to facilitate security studies research. Our ruling In his opposition to resettlement of Syrian refugees in Texas, Gov. Greg Abbott said he was concerned about potential terrorism from devotees to the Islamic State. In Texas, Abbott said, we've had three ISIS-related incidents already. Abbottis on solid ground with one Islamic State-related incident — the Garland shooting plot. In other Texas arrests related tothe group, he uses the term incident to cover things including lying about a tweet and trying to travel to Syria.

He and other Democrats adopted an I-told-you-so stance, with some Democrats taking the opportunity to remind the public that many Republicans opposed the auto bailouts.In a press release from Chrysler Group LLC announcing the loan repayment, the company's Chief Executive Officer Sergio Marchionne stated, Less than two years ago, we made a commitment to repay the U.S. and Canadian taxpayers in full, and today we made good on that promise.For this item, we're going to focus on whether the company repaid U.S. taxpayers. Chrysler Group LLC repaid $5.1 billion in Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) loans and formally terminated its ability to draw from a remaining $2.1 billion line of credit extended through TARP. Together with interest and fees, Chrysler Group has now paid $6.5 billion to the U.S. Treasury. It borrowed $5.1 billion from the U.S. government when it began operations under new ownership in June 2009. In addition, the U.S. Treasury still holds a 6.6 percent common equity stake in Chrysler Group.So is Chrysler now really square with the American taxpayer?The press release doesn't mention it, but there's more to the government's investment in Chrysler than the loans to Chrysler Group LLC.In its own press release about Chrysler's loan repayment, the U.S. Department of Treasury lays out a more complete picture of taxpayer support of Chrysler:Treasury committed a total of $12.5 billion to Chrysler under TARPs Automotive Industry Financing Program (AIFP), the release states. With todays transaction, Chrysler has returned more than $10.6 billion of that amount to taxpayers through principal repayments, interest, and cancelled commitments. Treasury continues to hold a 6.6 percent common equity stake in Chrysler. As previously stated, however, Treasury is unlikely to fully recover its remaining outstanding investment of $1.9 billion in Chrysler.In an interview with MSNBC's Andrea Mitchell on May 24, 2011, Ron Bloom, assistant to President Obama in charge of manufacturing policy, broke it down more plainly:Today, Chrysler is reducing their obligation to the U.S. taxpayer by $8 billion. They have previously provided us with $2.6 billion of funds. So, that $10.6 (billion) stacks up against $8.5 billion that the president invested in Chrysler and $4 billion from the prior administration. So, that's over 100 percent of all monies that this administration invested and about 85 percent of the total invested funds by the United States government.So how can the Chrysler Group LLC claim to have squared its obligation to the American taxpayers when only 85 percent of the taxpayers' investment in Chrysler has been recouped?Notice how we keep writing Chrysler Group LLC. There's a reason for that. That's the new Chrysler company that emerged from bankruptcy in 2009.We'll let Gualberto Ranieri, head of communications for the Chrysler Group LLC, explain.Ranieri likened the generic use of the word Chrysler to a fruit salad, which is made up of lots of different fruits: apples, strawberries, blueberries...you get the idea. When you talk about Chrysler, there's not just one company. There's the old Chrysler, the company that was liquidated in bankruptcy. There's the new Chrysler, aka Chrysler Group LLC, the newly formed company that purchased most of the assets of Old Chrysler in a bankruptcy sale. There's also the financing firms Chrysler Financial and GMAC.We are not responsible for the old Chrysler, Ranieri said. We are not responsible for Chrysler Financial. I am not responsible for my brother's loans, even though we have the same last name.Chrysler Group CEO Marchionne can only speak for the new company, Ranieri said, and the government money extended to Chrysler Group has been fully repaid, with interest.That's technically true, Edward Niedermeyer, editor-in-chief of The Truth About Cars website wrote this week. It does, however, fail to account (again) for the $1.9 billion Debtor-in-Possession 'loan' which financed Chrysler during bankruptcy and was conveniently left to die with the remains of 'Old Chrysler.' Nor does it account for the $1.5 billion loaned to Chryslers suppliers to keep them afloat amidst the bailout chaos.Chrysler and its political bedfellows should be forgiven for a little cheering, Niedermeyer wrote. The loan repayment is a positive sign of hope for a once seemingly doomed company.Its just that taxpayers still deserve a full and transparent accounting of 'every penny' (to borrow a phrase) that actually went into Chrysler, not just 'loans made in the last two years' or 'loans made by the Obama Administration' or other weasel-wordings employed to make the bailout seem more successful than it is, Niedermeyer wrote. Though bailout supporters will doubtless argue that 'it doesnt matter' because Chrysler is alive today and 'thats what matters,' this doesnt justify a lack of transparency. In fact, if the bailout was successful because GM and Chrysler survived, thats all the more reason to not fear the truth about what the bailout actually cost.James Gattuso, a senior research fellow in regulatory policy at the conservative Heritage Foundation, said there was nearly $2 billion in taxpayer money that went down with the ship with the old shell of Chrysler. Technically, he said, Chrysler Group LLC is a different company. But from a taxpayers' perspective, there's little distinction.If the taxpayers were a bank, they wouldn't stay in business very long, he said. The taxpayers took a loss, or they are still in the red at least.Now, the U.S. Treasury still owns a 6.6 percent common equity stake in Chrysler Group. That has an undetermined value, as the company has not yet gone public. But as the Treasury itself acknowledged, Treasury is unlikely to fully recover its remaining outstanding investment of $1.9 billion in Chrysler.We asked Lawrence J. White, a professor of economics at the Stern School of Business at New York University what he made of Marchionne's statement.This certainly appears to be another instance of careful language, where all of Chrysler's statement is focused on loans to Chrysler but not the other Treasury investments, White said. Yes, this appears to be an incomplete statement.As we noted earlier, the statements made by Marchionne were similar to those made by General Motors CEO Ed Whitacre last year. But the situations are different. For one, the government took a much larger equity stake in GM. For more details, see our fact-check related to Whitacre's claims last year.Again, there may be cause for celebratory comments from Chrysler. But Marchionne's statement, while technically accurate, doesn't tell the full story. Yes, Chrysler Group LLC has fully repaid the loans made to it two years ago. But that's not the full measure of the American taxpayers' investments to try to save Chrysler, including $2 billion to old Chrysler that was wiped out in bankruptcy. We doubt taxpayers care much about the distinctions in corporate titles. The government has now gotten most of its money back, but not all of it. Not yet anyway. UPDATE: The original version of this article mentioned Canadian taxpayers in the quotation. But since we are focusing on U.S, contributions, the reference to Canada was removed from the statement.",0.7,0.5,1,0.4331299927

Fifty-seven of these ideas ultimately became law, including measures to crack down on gangs and sexual predators, promote energy efficient buildings, appliances and vehicles, and help small businesses obtain affordable health coverage.The St. Petersburg Times and Miami Herald are launching PolitiFact Florida, accessed online at http://www.politifact.com/florida, with this examination of Rubio's claim. Fifty-seven fact-checks packed into one ruling.At a recent campaign event in front of a room full of reporters, Rubio -- who has met our Truth-O-Meter before -- offered this introduction:I don't want to get PolitiFact-checked today, Rubio said.Sorry. The Truth-O-Meter has come to Florida.How we got startedTaking Rubio at his word on the 43 unsuccessful ideas, we began by asking Rubio's Senate campaign for evidence about the 57 he says became law. Spokesman Alex Burgos pointed us to a May 2008 Miami Herald article, which referenced a two-page report prepared by Rubio's then-legislative staff.That report, like Rubio claims, says 57 of the 100 ideas have been completed.From there, we researched the validity of each claim, matching the idea from the book to a corresponding state law. Some of the ideas in Rubio's report listed specific House or Senate bills that we examined. For others, we searched the Legislature's online repository of bills from the 2007 and 2008 sessions, as well as newspaper articles and press releases from the time.When we found an idea that matched a description in law, we crossed it off our list. When we couldn't, we consulted with the appropriate state agency, the House Majority Office and/or Rubio's U.S. Senate campaign.In the end we created the chart that accompanies this story and shows our findings (at the bottom of this page). Overall, 24 of the 57 ideas Rubio takes credit for delivering we don't question. And we found 10 other ideas that are partially law, or were law under Rubio's watch, but are no longer in effect, or have some other type of asterisk.What Rubio got doneWhen the House and Senate passed property insurance legislation during a special session in January 2007, just two months after Rubio became speaker, House Republicans celebrated with a press release titled Nine down: 100 ideas gets special start.We agree with Rubio on eight of these nine ideas being accomplished. The legislation created a uniform, statewide building code, allowed policyholders to increase or decrease hurricane deductibles depending on the circumstances, and created a Truth in Premium Billing statement for policyholders. But an idea for expanding a short-term, no-interest bridge loan program didn't happen.Rubio can claim many other successes, though.Florida's presidential primary came earlier in 2008 as Rubio promised. Floridians seeking health care coverage now have an online database to check. Drivers can purchase multiple-year vehicle registrations. And the state created an investment money pool for businesses and infrastructure projects.I think that Marco Rubio drove the agenda down to the last hour that he was speaker, said state Sen. Don Gaetz, who worked with Rubio on education reforms in 2008, including four ideas that are now totally or partially law. Literally, in the last two hours he was speaker, I was still negotiating issues with him on behalf of the Senate.One of Rubio's ideas led to a requirement that school districts create career academies -- where students can be training in high-demand/high-need vocations. Another pushed the FCAT to later in the school year. A third increased tax credits for companies that contribute to education scholarships.Rubio supporter and former state Rep. Dennis Baxley, R-Ocala, notes that the ideas aren't all Rubio's -- he collected them at meetings across the state called Idearaisers. The meetings and then the book gave Floridians an opportunity to have their voices heard, Baxley said.The book framed a practical set of issues that the people had brought to us, said Baxley, who served as speaker pro tempore under Rubio. It gave us a platform to work from that was meaningful.Gaetz said Rubio's ideas still come up today.Marco's genius was in actually listening to people around the state and compiling the list of ideas, said Gaetz, who has endorsed Rubio's opponent Gov. Charlie Crist for Senate. He branded those ideas and that's the sign of a smart politician. Even still in 2010, as we put together health care and education bills, there will often be somebody, wryly or respectful, noting that what we're doing is in the 100 ideas book.What's not on the booksQuick math -- if 24 ideas are law, and 10 others are kind of law, that leaves 23 ideas that are something else.In the case of five of the ideas, we find it's wrong to suggest they could be achieved in law. Rubio, for instance, wanted the state to commit to having a Top 10 public university and to building a model transportation system. These, and three others, are more appropriately called broad goals, but none are law. (Rubio's office, in response, points to increased university funding or the leasing of toll roads to private companies as evidence these ideas were fulfilled.)That leaves 18 ideas that have not been enacted.Here's an example:Rubio says seven ideas dealing with the environment are now law thanks to a comprehensive energy bill that passed in 2008.One of our favorites was to provide incentives for alternative-fueled cars, including discounted parking and free or reduced tolls. We have a hybrid in the PolitiFact fleet, and the thought of free or reduced tolls sounded like a great idea.But the bill has no parking or toll incentives for hybrid or other alternative-fuel cars. It does, however, offer lonely hybrid drivers the opportunity to use state High Occupancy Vehicle lanes. But: Two other ideas concern Internet access for sexual offenders and minors, but neither is a law the way Rubio intended. One was to deny sex offenders access to popular Internet networking sites and to install tracking equipment on their computers.What passed in 2007 was a requirement that sex offenders register their e-mail and online instant message names with the Florida Department of Law Enforcement. The state could then forward that information to social networking sites, which could then choose to ban or block those users. During a presentation of the bill, the Web site MySpace.com agreed to receive the information from FDLE. But there is no tracking equipment, nor is there a requirement that MySpace.com or a Web site like Facebook delete the users FDLE finds.The other idea would have required social networking sites to set up verification systems to require parental notification and consent for minors to use these sites. There are no such requirements on sites like Facebook or MySpace.com.In those cases, and others we found, Rubio's ideas got lost as part of compromises between the Senate and House, said Rubio's former House spokeswoman Jill Chamberlin. Rubio supporter Baxley agreed.I don't think that there was an expectation that every bill that would pass would reflect every idea in the book, said Chamberlin, who continues to work for House Republicans. The legislative process is about negotiation and compromise.Rubio campaign spokesman Alex Burgos noted that Rubio himself described the 100 ideas book as much a process as it is a product.The beauty of the 100 ideas project is that these were ideas presented by Floridians, Burgos said. They weren't put in the book as pieces of legislation or executive orders. They were put in there as a starting point to be inserted in the legislative process.Others are less forgiving.At the end of the day, sadly, everyone wants to take credit for it, especially if it's a good idea, said state Sen. Mike Fasano, who is supporting Crist. I think then-speaker Rubio, now candidate Rubio, exaggerates when he suggests he accomplished all of these things.Our rulingRubio's claim is that 57 of the ideas in his book 100 Innovative Ideas For Florida's Future are now law. Based on our analysis, he has fallen short.Using the most generous accounting, Rubio might be able to say that he got 34 ideas into state lawbooks (adding together those ideas that we marked law or kind of law).Rubio's campaign had almost two weeks to review our findings, and responded Feb. 26, 2010, with five pages of explanations. In two cases, their information changed our decisions. We also offered Rubio the chance to address our findings. He chose, through a spokesman, not to.That leaves us to make a Truth-O-Meter ruling based on the information you see here, and in the corresponding chart.Based on our findings, 24 of Rubio's 100 ideas became law. Another 10 were partially enacted. That's not the kind of claim you're likely to hear in a TV ad, but it's what we found.Rubio delivered on education and property insurance reforms, and his book and its ideas remain part of the lexicon of the Florida Legislature. But 23 of the ideas either aren't law or could not be law. We find his claim Half True. Kind of. Committee structure changed, but not by law. Broad goal; cannot be achieved in law. Kind of. Funding increased, but no recurring revenue source. Program now defunct. No. Legislature capped an affordable housing trust fund that lowered overall project funding. One specific program saw increased funding from 2006 to 2007. But it wasnt funded in 2008. Kind of. State created a Web site with links to incentives and rewards, but did not create any new incentives.",0.5,0.4,0.9,0.6955883664

False Confidence (between 0 and 1): 0.1",Says opponent Mary Burke told reporters she would have required workers to give up bargained-for healthcare and retirement benefits like Gov. Walker.,"Democrat Brett Hulsey says that any union member who supports Mary Burke is like a chicken who votes for Colonel Sanders. Thems fightin words -- and theyre aimed at a fellow Democrat vying to take on Republican Gov. Scott Walker in the November election. Hulsey, a state representative from Madison and former vice president of a union local at a Sierra Club office, alleges outsourcing of jobs by Trek Bicycle when Burke was a Trek board member. Hulsey is also displeased with Burkes support of a charter school in Madison, where she is on the school board. But what really miffs Hulsey is Burke saying it was reasonable and fair for public employees to pay more toward their state-funded pensions and health insurance in 2011. In his controversial move to sharply limit collective bargaining, Walker and fellow Republicans imposed those cost-sharing moves on state employees and cleared the way for local governments to do the same. It was part of the law known as Act 10. Hulsey is accusing Burke of Walker-like anti-union behavior regarding those benefits and other issues. She supports taking public servants healthcare and retirement benefits, Hulsey claimed in a May 21, 2014 news release. And in a letter to Burke in advance of the South Central Federation of Labors annual bean feed, a long-running celebration sponsored by the Madison-based labor union umbrella group, Hulsey wrote: You told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel that you would have required workers to give up bargained for healthcare and retirement benefits like Gov. Walker. Is Hulsey right? Burkes statements on Act 10 Burke, who entered the governors race in early October 2013, has been remarkably consistent in her comments on Act 10. As support for his claim, Hulsey cites an April 18, 2014 interview with the Journal Sentinel in which Burke said she would work to restore collective bargaining for public workers while still seeking efficient government. In the interview, Burke said: If I had been governor I would have made sure I bargained for the changes that needed to be made to balance the state budget. I think it was only fair to ask for contributions to health care and pensions but I think those could have been negotiated, certainly firmly but fairly. Walkers approach, she said, left the state divided and has caused teachers and prospective educators to question whether salaries and benefits will be sufficient to support their careers and pay off student loans. Wisconsin walked away from the table and left it in a worse place, Burke said. So, Burke staked out a somewhat nuanced position. She defended getting public workers to pay more. She said shed have negotiated over the pension and health changes, in contrast to Walkers approach of removing those as subjects of bargaining. And she suggested she could have achieved a result similar to Walkers by being firm in her ask for the benefits changes. Could she have? Thats debatable. In 2011, some union leaders at one point said theyd agree to the benefits givebacks. But that was under extreme pressure because Walker had the votes for the stringent limits on bargaining -- and a ban on employers from deducting union dues from employee paychecks. In any event, its clear from Burkes comments that she wanted a similar result on pension and healthcare cost-sharing as Walker, but wouldnt -- and couldnt -- have required workers to pay more. Thats because, she said, shed have negotiated to try to get that. But her comments also suggest she would have made a high priority of getting those fair givebacks in exchange for something else. Burkes comments have been met with disappointment from some quarters on the left and among union leaders, but shes received endorsements from the largest state employee union, major teachers unions and the state AFL-CIO. They said her support is clear for collective bargaining, which she described as something that I believe in and think is right for our state, in an appearance on The Devils Advocates radio show. Meanwhile, Hulsey is making a full-throated pledge to try to repeal Act 10 as a whole, including the benefits cuts, saying the cuts were not necessary. He has pledged to provide back pay to workers whose wages declined because of the act. Hulsey told us that Burkes comments -- that she would have negotiated the benefits changes she needed -- amount to an approach that would have required the cuts of workers, just in a more humane way than Walker. Our rating Hulsey claimed Burke told Journal Sentinel reporters and editors that she would have required workers to give up bargained-for healthcare and retirement benefits like Gov. Walker. Theres an element of truth here in that Burke did say she backed benefits cuts in the same areas as Walker got, and was confident she could have achieved them. But Hulseys phrasing makes it sound like Burke backs Walkers approach. Thats a huge stretch given that she would have left collective bargaining intact and tried to negotiate the cost-cutting moves.",0.6,0.4,0.8,0.2336475678

Separately, the Texas Public Policy Foundation has estimated that 85 percent of the state's 4-year-olds are in a public or private pre-K program. The pre-K program funded by the state mostly serves children whose families live at or near the federal poverty level — an eligibility limit that state Sen. Rodney Ellis wants to erase in hopes, he says, of helping more children succeed in school. A 2006 study by researchers at Texas A&M University concluded that permitting all 4-year-olds to enter high-quality, full-day pre-K classes, in public or private settings, would deliver benefits greatly exceeding costs. The study took into account factors including educational outcomes, increased future earnings and reduced child welfare, child care, justice system and crime victims' costs. Ellis, D-Houston, filed proposals to open pre-K to all 4-year-olds in the 2005, 2007 and 2009 legislative sessions, but nothing happened, he complains. The May 14 issue of The Texas Observer quotes Ellis saying: Ive never gotten it out of committee or gotten a hearing. We wondered if Ellis accurately recapped the fate of his proposals. First, some background on this issue. Like most states, Texas limits pre-K eligibility to targeted groups. For starters, children have to be at least 3 years old to qualify. Until recently, they also had to be homeless or unable to speak and comprehend English or educationally disadvantaged — a characterization based on family income. Since 1985, state law has required any district with at least 15 eligible 4-year-olds to offer half-day pre-K, which is supported by state education aid. Districts that offer full-day programs must fund them by charging parents tuition or using other resources including state early-start grants, according to a 2010 report by the House Research Organization. The state put nearly $777 million into pre-K classes in 2008-09, according to the Texas Education Agency. With an assist from Ellis's office, we confirmed from legislative records that for each of the three sessions, Ellis filed his pre-K bill and it failed to win a hearing or be voted out of committee. In 2005 and 2007, identical House measures likewise languished. Still, we wondered if that inaction reflects lawmakers' indifference to early childhood education in general, or simply the three proposals by Ellis. Has any House or Senate member succeeded in winning consideration—or adoption—of measures widening pre-K access? Texas experts on pre-K told us that in 2006 and 2007, the Legislature took steps intended to expand access. In 2006, legislators agreed to a move by Sen. Leticia Van de Putte, D-San Antonio, to allow toddler dependents of adults on active military duty into pre-K; the expansion was rolled into a measure focused on education and school property taxes, according to Ida Garcia, Van de Puttes legislative director. In 2007, Garcia said, Van de Putte was among backers of a move to ensure pre-K eligibility for all children who had ever been in foster care became law. Previously, she said, children in foster care were permitted into pre-K classes but if they were later adopted, they could be barred. Pre-K experts noted too that legislators last year sent Gov. Rick Perry a proposal by Rep. Diane Patrick, R-Arlington, that directed $25 million to support full-day pre-K classes in school districts that adopted specific pre-K class-size limits and teacher-student ratios, among requirements. But Perry vetoed that bill, saying the money should be spent instead on existing grants enabling select districts to expand half-day classes to full-day offerings -- serving more students with greater needs, or 21,000 more students than would have been served under the vetoed proposal, the governor said. So how does Ellis statement shake out? Hes right that his proposals to open pre-K to all 4-year-olds never drew a hearing or advanced from committee. But a few efforts to expand eligibility for — or enhance — pre-K offerings have succeeded or won wide consideration.",1,0,0.9,0.8224366729

His new book, Fed Up! Our Fight to Save America from Washington, brims with what-the-hey statements about whassup in our nation's capital including a declaration that lit us up.Saying there's no end to the reach of Washington, Perry writes that Washington is even telling us what kind of light bulb we can use.We asked Perry for backup on that claim and didn't hear back. Then we launched a search for use-this-bulb regulations.What we found: In 2007, Congress voted to improve the efficiency of light bulbs. President George W. Bush signed into law the Energy Independence and Security Act, which set energy efficiency standards for kinds of incandescent lamps (light bulbs), incandescent reflector lamps (like track lighting in your kitchen), and fluorescent lamps, according to a December 2007 summary by the Congressional Research Service. With a few exceptions, the law also prohibits the U.S Coast Guard from purchasing incandescent light bulbs for use in Coast Guard office buildings.Barack Obama, Bush's successor, promised while running for president to to sign a measure into law that begins to phase out all incandescent light bulbs. He said the change would save Americans $6 billion a year on their electric bills. Last year, PolitiFact reported that no such proposal was made it into law, though in June 2009 Obama announced changes in lighting standards. Starting in August 2012, fluorescent tube lamps (most commonly found in offices and stores) and conventional incandescent reflector lamps must become more efficient. The government said such fluorescent and incandescent lamps represented approximately 38 percent and 7 percent, respectively, of total lighting energy use.Our search for instances of the government directing which bulbs residents can use unearthed a June 2010 editorial in the Washington Times objecting to Federal Trade Commission-issued regulations of light-bulb labels. The editorial says the regs were ordered by Congress as part of its 2007 decision to force the more efficient, curlicue-shaped compact fluorescent light bulb on a public that so far has refused to embrace it willingly. Beginning Jan. 1, 2012, the editorial says, bureaucratic rules will phase in, and conventional 100-watt bulbs will be first on the contraband list.Make sense?Jen Stutsman, spokeswoman for the U.S. Department of Energy, told us that conventional incandescent bulbs are not expected to meet the efficiency standards Congress set, though the government expects manufacturers to improve incandescent technologies to meet the higher standards or consumers will move to compact fluorescent light bulbs, LED technologies or halogens. She said new standards for 100-watt bulbs take effect in January 2012. New standards for 75-watt bulbs start in 2013 and standards for 60- and 40-watt bulbs start in 2014.Stutsman said the expected shifts aren't equivalent to the government telling Americans which light bulbs to use. Under no circumstances does it say that a consumer must purchase a specific type of light bulb, Stutsman said.Finally, we sought advice from the Dallas-based American Lighting Association, a trade group whose director of engineering and technology, Terry McGowan, said in an e-mail that it's a stretch to say federal laws are telling us what light bulb to buy. Federal law is requiring that household light bulbs be made more efficient in steps over time as a nationwide energy-saving measure. It's like saying that new cars will have to deliver more miles/gallon. Maybe some people would say that's mandating what kind of car to buy; but that's an interpretation — especially if many cars on the market can meet the miles/gallon requirement, McGowan said.There will still be household light bulbs available, McGowan's e-mail says, noting later that special-purpose bulbs used in appliances or for decorative purposes are exempted. One thing is for sure; what we use for lighting our homes will take some thought — and maybe we'll be changing what we decide to do.So, is Washington telling us what kind of bulb to use?Not yet, though the 2007 law steps up efficiency requirements and that's expected to result in consumers purchasing and using different bulbs. These factors give Perry's statement an element of truth. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.",0.6,0.5,0.75,0.0475671272

Greg Abbott updated his reopening plan to add businesses such as hair salons and gyms, he recommended that at-risk populations remain at home if at all possible and avoid in-person gatherings, such as a church service, funeral or wedding. We strongly encourage at-risk populations to try to watch or participate remotely, remembering this very important point, and that is almost 75 percent of the deaths from COVID-19 in the state of Texas are a result of people contracting COVID-19 who are age 65 and older, Abbott said. Texas was among the first states to start reopening businesses and lifting restrictions put in place to curb the spread of the coronavirus, allowing retail stores and restaurants to open May 1 at 25 percent capacity. Abbott announced the latest set of reopenings Monday, expanding restaurant capacity to 50 percent and granting bars the ability to open at 25 percent capacity within the next couple weeks. This comes as the state continues to see its number of infections and deaths rise and clusters form mostly in rural parts of the state where meatpacking plants are located. Hospitalizations, however, have decreased since mid-April. With that in mind, we had to ask: Is Abbott right that almost 75% of coronavirus deaths in Texas are people older than 65? Looking at the numbers Abbotts spokesman John Wittman said Abbotts claim is based on figures from the Texas Department of Health Services, which publishes daily numbers on the states COVID-19 testing and cases. The data includes a breakdown of coronavirus deaths by age, race and gender, but only for those cases where the deaths have been investigated by the local and regional health departments. As of Wednesday, the majority, or 489, were still under investigation. The demographic data on cases and fatalities come from the case investigation forms submitted by local health departments and our regional offices, said DSHS spokesman Chris Van Deusen. The purpose of the investigation is to confirm that the person had COVID-19 but also to collect other details about them and the circumstances around their death, Van Deusen said. Wittman said the data showed that 75% of investigated deaths were people 65 and older when Abbott made this statement. It alternates almost daily, but its generally around that range, Wittman said. As of May 6, the day after the press conference, the death toll in Texas was 948. Fewer than half, or 433, had been investigated. Of those, about 71 percent were Texans 65 and older. It was still about 71 percent, or 345 out of 489 investigated cases, as of Wednesday. The age groups broke down like so: Ages 10 to 19 years old: 2 deaths, or 0.4% Ages 20-29: 10 deaths, or 2.04 % Ages 30-39: 9 deaths, or 1.8% Ages 40-49: 21 deaths, or 4.29% Ages 50-59: 54 deaths, or 11.04% Ages 60-64: 45 deaths, or 9.2% Ages 65-69: 59 deaths, or 12.06% Ages 70-74: 45 deaths, or 9.2% Ages 75-79: 45 deaths, or 9.2% Ages 80+: 196 deaths, or 40.08% Across the United States, about 79% of coronavirus deaths have been people 65 years and older, according to the National Center for Health Statistics data submitted between the beginning of February to the beginning of May. Like Texas statistics, the national numbers are also incomplete. The number of deaths represent only those entered between those dates and only include people with confirmed or presumed COVID-19. While 80% of deaths are electronically processed and coded by NCHS within minutes, most deaths from COVID-19 must be coded by a person, which takes an average of 7 days, the NCHS states on its website. The data is also always somewhat behind because of the lag time between when a death occurred and when a death certificate is completed, submitted to NCHS and processed for reporting purposes. The delay can last anywhere from one week to eight or more. Our ruling Abbott said almost 75 percent of the deaths from COVID-19 in the state of Texas are a result of people contracting COVID-19 who are age 65 and older. Of confirmed coronavirus deaths, close to 75% were people within the age group Abbott provided, but he failed to include the caveat that this statistic leaves out more than half of the total deaths that have not yet been investigated.",0.9,0.1,1,0.8669952004

False Confidence (between 0 and 1): 0.1",Says Betsy DeVos is the most unpopular person in our government.,"A congressional hearing about the Trump administrations policy on student debt turned personal for Education Secretary Betsy DeVos. Most of the Dec. 12 hearing focused on DeVos actions related to a student debt relief rule. Democrats said DeVos made it harder for certain students to get debt relief, while Republicans defended her response to Obama-era rules. At the hearing, the main topic was how DeVos sought to make changes to the borrower defense to repayment rule. The provision was little used until the Obama administration established new rules to help students get their federal education loans cancelled if colleges misrepresented graduation rates, their ability to transfer credits or their job placement rates. The Obama administration finalized changes to the regulations in 2016 after Corinthian Colleges, a for-profit chain, closed its doors amid fraud allegations. DeVos sought to rewrite the rules, leading to extensive litigation, including a contempt of court finding against DeVos. DeVos blamed the Obama administration for the backlog of tens of thousands of cases and announced changes that include tiers of loan relief. U.S. Rep. Frederica Wilson, a former school board member and principal from South Florida, went after DeVos, saying she is trying to destroy public education. You are the most unpopular person in our government, said Wilson, a Democrat. Millions will register to vote in 2020. Many will vote to remove you more than to remove the president. The ranking Republican on the committee, Rep. Virginia Foxx of North Carolina, said Wilsons comments were over the line. DeVoss confirmation in 2017 was a contentious one for the Trump administration and required a tie-breaking vote by Vice President Mike Pence. DeVos, a longtime wealthy Republican donor from Michigan, is an advocate for vouchers and charter schools. As fact-checkers, we wanted to focus on the checkable aspect of what Wilson said: Is DeVos really the most unpopular person in the U.S. government? Wilsons statement about in our government was overly broad, but what she was referring to was what poll respondents said about DeVos compared to other Trump Cabinet officials. We found polling that supports Wilsons statement about DeVoss popularity, but the polling is more than one year old. We found that YouGov and Morning Consult have conducted separate polls that compare the favorability of Trumps Cabinet members. Wilsons spokeswoman cited a 2017 article in the Huffington Post entitled, How Betsy DeVos Became The Most Hated Cabinet Secretary. The article cited an October 2017 HuffPost/YouGov internet poll that found 35% had a strongly unfavorable view of DeVos, the highest among 13 officials. (Former Attorney General Jeff Sessions finished second.) However, the poll also showed that many respondents were not familiar enough with the Cabinet members to give a favorability opinion. DeVos was among the most familiar officials, as 30% of respondents said they were unfamiliar with her. YouGov has polled about DeVos favorability five times since she was appointed. The most recent poll, in April 2018, found DeVos had the highest very unfavorable rating (28%). Politico/Morning Consult polled about the favorability of DeVos on four occasions since 2017, with the most recent one in the spring of 2018. That poll showed DeVos with a 31% very unfavorable rating, the highest among 15 Cabinet members. Even though the polls are a little dated, Wilsons statement is consistent with the evidence, said Washington University political scientist Steven S. Smith. Education Department spokeswoman Angela Morabito told PolitiFact that DeVos isnt working to win a popularity contest. But she pointed to polling by an education research and policy journal showing growing public support for certain school choice programs. Related: By the numbers: Is college worth the cost? Wilson said DeVos is the most unpopular person in our government. Two polling organizations asking about popularity for about a dozen Trump administration officials back up her statement, though they are a little outdated. We found no polling about the popularity for DeVos in 2019.",0.8,0.2,0.9,0.2350351089

Jan Crawford, CBS legal correspondent, said the websites collapse stood out even more in light of the hype that led up to the opening day. With great fanfare they pointed to that date, Crawford said on Face the Nation. They had health care clinics across the country signing people up for appointments that day to get people in for this promise of affordable health care. On day one, six people were able to sign up. We wondered, was it true that just six people were able to successfully enroll in plans offered through the federal insurance marketplace created as part of the new health care law? Thats what well look into. For the most part, Crawford got it right. The figure of six people comes from documents released by the House committee investigating the failed rollout of Obamacare. The documents are copies of notes taken by staff at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, the agency in charge of the website project. At the top of the notes are the words War room. They were written two and three days after the site opened for business on Tuesday, Oct. 1. An entry from a meeting on Wednesday morning said six enrollments have occurred so far. By the end of the second day, the notes reported 248 people had signed up and about 40,000 applications were pending. A spokesperson for the U.S. Health and Human Services Department told reporters that these were not official numbers and that people could also enroll through other means, including filling out paper applications. Some states are also operating their own insurance marketplaces. Joanne Peters, Health and Human Services spokeswoman, told Bloomberg that by the last week of October, about 700,000 people had submitted applications, with about half coming through the federal marketplace and half coming through the states. There were ongoing issues with sending enrollment information to insurance companies, Peters said. Official numbers might be released by mid November. Our ruling Crawford said that only six people had been able to sign up on the first day of open enrollment for the federal health insurance marketplace. That fits with the internal notes released by the House committee. But those were initial numbers and there is some possibility that other people could have enrolled without using the website. Official numbers are not available.",1,0,1,0.5111317157
