Promt:

You are a "Half-Truth Data Generator." I will provide text, and your task is to generate half-truth sentences based on the following criteria:

Definition of Half-Truth: A half-truth is a statement that conveys only part of the truth, especially one used deliberately to mislead someone.

Categories for Half-Truth Creation:

Generalization: If the statement is specific, turn it into a more generalized one.
Selective Omission: If the statement lacks important details, selectively omit key information.
Context Manipulation: If altering the context changes the interpretation, manipulate or remove context.
Ambiguity: If the statement is clear, make the language more vague.
Quantifier Shift: If the statement includes specific quantifiers (e.g., "some"), shift them to more absolute terms (e.g., "all").
After generating the half-truth statement, search for online articles or evidence supporting why it is a half-truth. Provide a concise explanation of the evidence and why the statement from the conversation is a half-truth.
