Final Rating: False  ",The boilermakers union has endorsed me because I sat down with them and went into great detail with leadership [about] exactly what I would do.,"When asked to prove his support for fracking is genuine, Joe Biden said last week that hed won the backing of the boilermakers, a union whose members depend on the natural gas industry and passionately support the controversial drilling technique. The boilermakers union has endorsed me because I sat down with them and went into great detail with leadership [about] exactly what I would do, Biden said Thursday in Philadelphia during a nationally televised ABC News town hall. Thats not true. Biden hasnt been endorsed by the International Brotherhood of Boilermakers — which represents 50,000 people across the country who work in heavy industry, manufacturing, and related sectors — or Local 154, the Pittsburgh-area chapter mentioned at the event. The international union states clearly on its website that it hasnt endorsed a candidate for president this cycle. The International Brotherhood of Boilermakers has not endorsed any U.S. Presidential candidate for the 2020 Election, and the information contained on this webpage in no way serves as an endorsement by the International Brotherhood of Boilermakers for any U.S. Presidential candidate. A note on the website continues: As a union boilermaker, your vote is a personal decision. You have the right to vote for candidates and issues as you so choose. Your vote can make a difference in electing the representatives and policymakers who support labor issues and advocate for the work boilermakers do. Local union lodges arent bound by what the larger umbrella group does, and in September, Local 154 endorsed President Donald Trump. The other day I'm watching the debate and I see Joe Biden tell everybody that the boilermakers endorsed him and that is not true, said John Hughes, Local 154s business manager. He said he talked to somebody. I'd like to know who he talked to in the boilermakers because anybody I talk to did not endorse him. Asked for evidence that Biden spoke with members of the boilermakers union, Andrew Bates, the Biden campaigns director of rapid response, provided none. Instead he listed several other Pennsylvania unions Biden met with and won endorsements from while campaigning, such as Teamsters Local 249, United Association of Plumbers Local 27, and Pennsylvania AFL-CIO. Bates added that the boilermakers endorsed Joe Biden twice. Hes talking about the 2008 and 2012 election cycles, when the union endorsed President Barack Obama, and Joe Biden was his running mate. But an Obama endorsement doesnt automatically count as a Biden nod. The Democratic nominating contest was still in full swing in February 2008 when the boilermakers union threw its support behind Obama. Not only had Obama not yet named Biden as his running mate, but Biden was still seeking the nomination himself and had been passed over for the endorsement. The endorsement the boilermakers made in 2012 when Obama was running for reelection could more plausibly be described as support for an Obama-Biden ticket. The boilermakers union came up at the town hall when Pittsburgh resident Michele Ellison asked Biden to describe his vision for the energy sector in Southwestern Pennsylvania, where fracking has lifted the economy and employed plenty of boilermakers but also sickened some residents who live near the wells that extract natural gas from miles beneath the Earths surface. Before answering the question, Biden emphasized, as he has said repeatedly, that he does not want to ban fracking. He wants to block the federal government from issuing new permits for drilling on public land but would otherwise allow existing fracking operations to continue, with environmental safeguards in place. He went on to say that he wants to invest in renewable energy and the battery technology needed to store it. Biden said the boilermakers union has endorsed me. There are several things wrong with this statement. First, the International Brotherhood of Boilermakers hasnt endorsed a candidate for president this cycle. Second, Local 154, the Pittsburgh area chapter mentioned during the town hall, endorsed Trump. Third, the boilermakers did not endorse Biden twice in the past as his campaign said. And fourth, the Biden campaign provided no evidence that he sat down with the unions leaders as he said. Bidens statement is not accurate.",0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,False

Final Rating: False  ",A horrible law requires that children be separated from their parents once they cross the Border into the U.S.,"President Donald Trump wrongly blamed Democrats for his own administrators immigration policy. Put pressure on the Democrats to end the horrible law that separates children from there (sic) parents once they cross the Border into the U.S., Trump tweeted. Trump recently told Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen, I know what you're going through right now with families is very tough, but those are the bad laws that the Democrats gave us. We have to break up families. But there is no law that mandates separating children from their parents. Trumps own administration devised a policy to that effect. So what is Trump talking about? Whenever parents are charged with a federal misdemeanor (entry without inspection in this case), or awaiting trial, they are placed in the custody of the U.S. Marshals Service. Children cannot go to jail, so they are transferred to the custody of Health and Human Services Office of Refugee Resettlement. They are then placed with relatives, juvenile detention centers or foster care. Thats a longstanding Homeland Security policy, DHS told us. Before the Trump administration, immigrants entering illegally as families were rarely prosecuted, said Sarah Pierce, an associate policy analyst of the U.S. Immigration Program at the Migration Policy Institute. Instead, immigrants were held in family detention centers until they were sent to appear before an immigration court or deported. Attorney General Jeff Sessionsannounced on April 6 the Homeland Security Department would now be referring all illegal border crossings to the Justice Department for prosecution. Facing criminal charges, parents would go to detention centers, leaving their children unaccompanied. Its the decision to prosecute parents that is causing the separations. Thats a choice they have made thats largely different from what other administrations have done, said Peter Margulies, an immigration law and national security law professor at Roger Williams University School of Law. When we asked for evidence of policies separating families, the White House referred us to items determining what happens to unaccompanied immigrant minors. But none of the children in question would be deemed unaccompanied if the Trump administration did not decide to prosecute their parents. The 1997 Flores Settlement Agreement, for example, calls for the release of unaccompanied minors to family members or sponsors who can care for them as their immigration case is resolved. The Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of 2008, which Trump has wrongly called a Democrat rule, determines that unaccompanied minors be transferred to Health and Human Servicescustody. The White House argued such policies encourage parents to send their children into the United States, knowing they will be promptly released. The cruel and inhumane open borders policies of the Democratic Party are responsible for encouraging mass illegal migration, enabling horrendous child smuggling, and releasing violent MS-13 gang members into American communities, White House deputy press secretary Hogan Gidley said in an emailed statement. The Trump administration may believe that Democrats are responsible for policies that encourage illegal border crossing, but we found no law mandating that children be separated from their parents. Trump said a horrible law requires that children be separated from their parents once they cross the Border into the U.S. There is no such law. The Homeland Security Departments longstanding policy is to separate children from their custodians when they are referred for criminal prosecution. Trumps administration has decided to prosecute all illegal crossings. Families were rarely prosecuted under previous administrations.",0,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,False

Final Rating: False  ",President Obama gave Egypt's Muslim Brotherhood one and a half billion dollars.,"Foreign policy was one of the issues that came up when U.S. Senate candidate Benjamin Barry Hinckley was interviewed on State of the State, a cable television public affairs program that aired April 21 and 22.Hinckley, a Republican, was critical of foreign aid, and specifically questioned one of the aid decisions of the Obama administration. He was struggling a bit as he made his point, but here's what he said:Obama gave the Muslim Brotherhood a million [then correcting himself] a billion and a half dollars last week, you know, in Egypt. We need that money here. A billion and a half dollars could really help Rhode Island, quite frankly. We probably need it, in my opinion, more than the Muslim Brotherhood needs it . . . especially when the Muslim Brotherhood got together, I think one of the first things they did, when they convened their new congress, was to make Israel enemy #1. And we give them a billion and a half dollars? That's a problem in my book. We need to focus our resources here.The Muslim Brotherhood has been a part of Egyptian politics -- sometimes an outlawed part -- since 1928; one of its goals is to promote Sharia law, which is the moral code and religious law of Islam.Did the Obama administration really give the Brotherhood $1.5 billion?It turns out that the money was actually an aid package to Egypt itself, not the Brotherhood, according to a March 22 story in The Washington Post.We contacted Hinckley's campaign.Spokesman Christopher McAuliffe said Hinckley is aware that there is a pro forma difference between the Muslim Brotherhood and the government of Egypt. In that light, his position could certainly have been more precise. However, I do think the basis of it is readily understandable, since the Egyptian government is dominated by the Muslim Brotherhood.For guidance on that point, we contacted some experts on Egypt.Melani Cammett, director of the Middle East studies program at Brown University, told us that sending aid to Egypt was not the same as giving it to the Brotherhood because the Brotherhood doesn't actually control the government.It's true that the Muslim Brotherhood won the plurality of seats [in December elections] and when you combine them with the Salafis, which are more radical Islamists, they've won the majority of seats in the parliament, she said. The fact of the matter is the SCAF, which is the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces, still controls the government and controls the executive branch and is manipulating things in such a way that it's making it difficult for the Islamists to exert their full power as the majority in parliament.So the major struggle going on in Egyptian politics right now is that the SCAF, controlled by elite military officers, is not willing to relinquish power, said Cammett.John P. Entelis, director of Middle East studies at Fordham University, said it would be totally inaccurate to say that $1.5 billion is going to the Muslim Brotherhood. This is an ongoing military aid package that we've been giving to Egypt since 1979.The aid package, according to multiple sources, includes $1.3 billion in military aid and $250 million in economic and political assistance.Our rulingRepublican U.S. Senate candidate Barry Hinckley said the Obama administration approved $1.5 billion to go to Egypt's Muslim Brotherhood.In fact, the aid package was for the nation of Egypt, not the Brotherhood. The Brotherhood may control the largest bloc of seats in parliament, but it's not even a majority. Not only that, the country itself continues, for now at least, to be controlled by the military. And more than 80 percent of the aid package is military aid.(Get updates from PolitiFactRI on Twitter.

Final Rating: False  ",Kobe Bryants untimely death has been planned for a while.,"Former NBA player Kobe Bryant, his 13-year-old daughter and seven other people were killed on Jan. 26 when the helicopter they were riding in crashed in Calabasas, Calif. Online, some people are claiming that the crash wasnt an accident. We already debunked one Facebook post that suggested Bryant was murdered. Now, were looking at an Instagram post that claims Bryants death was planned. After LeBron James passes Kobe on the all time NBA scoring list, Kobes personal helicopter crashes only a day later, the Jan. 26 post says. LeBron has to hit the 33,644 point mark to pass Kobe Bryant & become the NBAs 3rd highest scorer in history. The 33 is significant. The 6 is significant. And Ive been speaking on the importance of the 44 ritual in pro sports for months now. To me, this looks like a ritual sacrifice in order for the LA Lakers to win their 17th championship, & for LeBron to get his 4th ring. I believe this was also a ritual sacrifice for the 49ers to win the Superbowl. It goes on about the significance of other numbers, like Bryants birthday, before concluding: This definitely makes me believe that his untimely death has been planned for a while now. This post was flagged as part of Facebooks efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) On Jan. 25, Los Angeles Laker LeBron James passed Bryants all-time scoring record. Playing against the Philadelphia 76ers that day, James finished with 29 points, bringing his career total to 33,655, according to the Washington Post. Bryant finished his career with 33,643. Bryant tweeted his congratulations that night: Continuing to move the game forward @KingJames. Much respect my brother #33644. But theres no evidence to suggest that Bryant, a former Lakers star, was killed in a ritual sacrifice, as the Instagram post claims. Rather, Bryants plane crashed in fog dense enough that the Los Angeles Police Department grounded its helicopters. National Transportation Safety Board investigators arrived in California after the incident, and the agency is working with the Federal Aviation Administration, the helicopters manufacturer and the company that made its engine to collect evidence about the crash, according to the Post. The investigation will look at weather data, radar information air traffic control communications, maintenance logs and the pilots record.",0,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,False

Final Rating: False  ",SaysGeorgia becomes first state to ban Muslim culture in historic move to restore Western values.,"A post that appears to have originated from fake news purveyors in Macedonia used a real news item from months ago to falsely say the U.S. state of Georgia has outlawed Muslim culture. A March 13, 2017, post on USANewsPost.us carried the headline, Georgia becomes first state to ban Muslim culture in historic move to restore Western values.  Facebook users flagged the post as potentially being fake, as part of the social media giants efforts to remove fake news from news feeds. PolitiFact Georgia examined the origins of this claim as part of the inauguralInternational Fact-Checking Day, April 2, 2017. Organizers at Poynter.orgdescribe the day as not a single event but a rallying cry for more facts - and fact-checking - in politics, journalism, and everyday life. The story cited an actual event — a Peach State lawmaker had introduced a bill in November 2016 in the Georgia General Assembly that would have banned the wearing of burqas, niqabs and veils. The story trumpeted the bill as being about keeping the American people safe. But the post did not indicate that the legislation never became law. State Rep. Jason Spencer on Nov. 15 filed HB 3 for the 2017 legislative session. The bill aimed to expand the scope of a state law passed in 1951 that made wearing a mask a misdemeanor (unless it was for celebrations, work, sports or emergencies). The original law aimed to prevent Ku Klux Klan members from wearing their hoods. Spencers bill could have prevented Muslim women from wearing any kind of head covering while driving, or possibly even while on public property. It also prevented people from wearing veils in drivers licenses and government-issued IDs, a rule the state already had. This bill is simply a response to constituents that do have concerns of the rise of Islamic terrorism, and we in the State of Georgia do not want our laws used against us, Spencer told Atlantas WSB-TV. The quote is cited in the USANewsPost.us article, which made an inference that if the bill passed, Georgia would have stopped Muslim culture in a way no other state had. (For the most part, the wearing of religious headcoverings is protected by the First Amendment.) But the bill didnt pass the General Assembly, because Spencer withdrew the measure just two days later. After further consideration, I have decided to not pursue HB 3 in the upcoming 2017 legislative session due to the visceral reaction it has created, he said in a statement. While this bill does not contain language that specifically targets any group, I am mindful of the perception that it has created. My objective was to address radical elements that could pose a threat to public safety. However, further consideration dictates that other solutions will need to be considered. In conclusion, anti-masking statutes have been upheld as constitutional (State vs Miller, 1990), and HB 3 would withstand legal scrutiny, but not political scrutiny. The Miller case to which Spencer refers involved a Klan member who challenged the Anti-Mask Act and lost. USANewsPost.us cites DailyUSAUpdate.com as the source of the post, and that site in turn says the post came from OpenMagazines.com. The story also has been shared on Facebook, across several other websites, tens of thousands of times. We contacted OpenMagazines.com via email to ask them about the misleading headline but didnt hear back. BuzzFeed has previously reported that both OpenMagazines.com and DailyUSAUpdate.com are registered to owners in Macedonia. The former Yugoslav republic became a hotbed of fake news during last years presidential election. Buzzfeed found that teenagers in the town of Veles operated at least 140 websites that published fake political news in the United States to draw in advertising dollars. USANewsPost.us also is registered to an administrator and address in Veles. Our ruling Bloggers said in a headline, Georgia becomes first state to ban Muslim culture in historic move to restore Western values. The post misrepresents the outcome of a months-old and short-lived legislative proposal from November 2016 that could have prevented Muslim women from hearing veils and headscarves. Muslim culture was not banned, although it did appear to briefly be under attack.",0,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,False

Final Rating: False  ","Says Kamala Harris said, If elected & you dont surrender your guns, I will sign an executive order & the police will show up at your door.","Sen. Kamala Harris has taken a strong stance on gun control, but has she actually threatened to send police to your house to take your guns? The short answer is no. But that hasnt stopped social media users from spreading a fabricated quote attributed to her that suggests otherwise. If elected & you dont surrender your guns, I will sign an executive order & the police will show up at your door, reads a post attributed to Harris, the newly selected running mate for presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden. Harris didnt say this. And there is no evidence Harris plans to force people to surrender their guns. The post was flagged as part of Facebooks efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The claim appears to be a mischaracterization of a pledge Harris made during a CNN Presidential Town Hall in April 2019. Upon being elected, I will give the United States Congress 100 days to get their act together and have the courage to pass reasonable gun safety laws, and if they fail to do it, then I will take executive action, Harris said during the town hall. Harris continued, clarifying what her executive action would encompass. And specifically what I will do is put in place a requirement that for anyone who sells more than five guns a year, they are required to do background checks when they sell those guns, Harris said. I will require that for any gun dealer that breaks the law, the ATF take their license. During the town hall, Harris did not discuss confiscating guns using law enforcement officers. Whats more, a commitment to use executive action can refer to more than just executive orders, as the Washington Post reported. At another campaign event in August 2019 in Las Vegas, Harris reiterated her pledge to take action on guns within 100 days of taking office. At that event, she said she would also use executive action to implement a ban on the importation of assault rifles into our country. In a follow-up question, Harris was asked what enforcement of an assault rifles ban might look like. A reporter is heard off-camera asking, Does it involve law enforcement essentially going to peoples houses looking for specific banned guns? Does it involve perhaps creating a database of people who are legal gun owners? What kind of process are we talking about here? Harris answered by referencing her experience as attorney general in California, when she said law enforcement was permitted to confiscate guns by going to the doors of people who were both found by a court to be a danger to themselves and others and were also on a list where they were precluded and prohibited from owning a gun because of a conviction. I have to stress, lawful gun ownership, that is one thing. Were talking about something else and we have to stop conflating and blending all these issues, Harris said. Harris did not say she planned to send law enforcement officers to the homes of all gun owners, as the post suggests. When we first spotted the false quote being shared Aug. 11 on a Facebook page called YET-iheart-NRA, PolitiFact reached out to the page administrator to ask what evidence they had to support the claim. Someone with the Facebook page responded, pointing us to an article from the blog Law Enforcement Today. That article referenced an exchange between Biden and Harris in the September 2019 Democratic presidential primary debate, found here. In it, debate moderator David Muir of ABCs World News Tonight pointed out that Harris said she planned to use executive action to ban imports of AR-15 assault weapons if Congress did not act quickly enough. Muir explained that Biden had expressed doubts about the future presidents constitutional authority to ban assault weapons via executive order, which Harris had not committed to doing. When asked if Bidens stated concern had a point, Harris jokingly replied, I mean I would just say, Hey Joe, instead of saying no we cant, lets say yes we can. Here again, there is no evidence she made the statement that is being attributed to her. (The post made by YET-iheart-NRA appears to have been removed since we inquired about it.) Other fact-checking organizations debunked similar claims that circulated online in 2019, but Harris new role as vice presidential candidate caused the claim to reemerge. Fact-checking organizations have continued debunking the claim after it reappeared. A post claims that vice presidential candidate Sen. Kamala Harris said, If elected & you dont surrender your guns, I will sign an executive order & the police will show up at your door. This quote is fabricated. When she was running for president, Harris pledged to take executive action on gun control within the first 100 days of her administration. She did not say she would require people to surrender their guns or say she would order law enforcement to collect guns.",0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,False

Final Rating: False  ",Ronald Reagans philosophy of peace through strength is why the Iranians released the hostages on the same day and at the same hour that Reagan was sworn in.,"During a March 6, 2012, video address to a conference of the American-Israel Public Affairs Committee, Mitt Romney seized the tough foreign policy mantle of President Ronald Reagan. I believe the right course is what Ronald Reagan called peace through strength, Romney told the pro-Israel group. There's a reason why the Iranians released the hostages on the same day and at the same hour that Reagan was sworn in. As president, I'll offer that kind of clarity, strength and resolve. But was Reagans peace through strength philosophy really responsible for freeing the 52 Americans who were taken hostage by Islamic militants and held for 444 days? First, a reminder of what the hostage crisis was all about. In 1979, the Shah of Iran -- who had been installed and supported by successive United States administrations -- was overthrown by Islamic revolutionaries. Militants took over the American embassy and held hostages from Nov. 4, 1979, until Jan. 20, 1981 -- the day President Jimmy Carter passed the reins to Reagan, who had defeated him amid widespread public disapproval of the incumbents handling of the crisis. Iran contacted the Carter administration in September 1980 with a proposal to end the hostage crisis, said Gary Sick, a Columbia University professor who has written two books about the Iran hostage crisis. The U.S. made a proposal. Iran responded with an unacceptable offer just a day or two before the election. Afterwards, they nominated the Algerians to act as intermediaries. Those valuable discussions went on until literally the day or two before the inauguration, and they were settled by the Iranians caving in on a number of issues that were extremely costly to them. By my calculations, the Iranians ended up paying about $300,000 per hostage per day of incarceration. The agreement that led to the release, as described by the New York Times 11 days after it occured, revolved around $11 billion to $12 billion in Iranian assets that Carter had frozen 10 days after the seizure of the U.S. embassy. It had been negotiated over the course of several months before Reagan's inauguration. The Times, in its account of the inauguration, reported that no one on the speaker's stand knew of the latest developments in Iran. Word quickly spread among the governors, Congressmen and Reagan friends, family and aides as they left the platform. Carter informed Reagan at 8:31 a.m. that the release of the hostages was imminent, but the onetime bitter rivals for the presidency told reporters as they entered the speaker's area separately, to the flourish of trumpets, that the hostages had not yet taken off from Tehran. The President got his first chance to announce the news at 2:15 p.m. at a luncheon with Congressional leaders in Statuary Hall in the Capitol. So Reagan, not Carter, got to bask in the glow of the hostages safe return. However, we contacted seven scholars of the period, and their consensus was that neither Reagan nor his philosophy played any significant role in freeing the hostages. Well before Reagan became president, the deal for releasing the hostages had already been worked out by the Carter administration's State Department and the Iranians, ably assisted by Algerian diplomats, said David Farber, a Temple University historian and author of Taken Hostage: The Iranian Hostage Crisis and America's First Encounter with Radical Islam. No Reagan administration officials participated in the successful negotiations, Farber added. The Iranian government waited to officially release the Americans until Carter had left the presidency as a final insult to Carter, whom they despised. They believed Carter had betrayed the Iranian revolution by allowing the self-exiled Shah to receive medical attention in the United States and then had threatened their new government by attempting, unsuccessfully, to use military force in April 1980 to free the hostages. By doing this, Iran thought they were showing the world that they could meddle in our affairs, just as we had done to them in 1953, added Dave Houghton, a political scientist at the University of Central Florida and author of U.S. Foreign Policy and the Iran Hostage Crisis. Houghton suggested that Iran had a relatively unsophisticated grasp of U.S. politics, and said he thinks its possible that the Iranians didnt even know what Reagan had said on the campaign trail. I don't think they were scared into the release, Houghton said. In all likelihood, they released the hostages because they needed the sanctions we'd placed on them lifted so they could finance their war with Iraq. The one scholar who entertained the possibility that Iran was taking heed of the future presidents philosophy was Michael Gunter, a political scientist at Tennessee Tech University and the author of several papers about the crisis. Still, Gunter added, the main reason for the release was that the mileage the Iranians had gained by holding the hostages had been used for everything it was worth and there was no further advantage in continuing. Several other experts agreed that the Iranians focus was on Carter, not Reagan. If it was related to the occupant of the White House, it certainly had more to do with Carter than Reagan, said Stephen Kinzer, a former New York Times reporter who now teaches at Boston University and authored the book, Reset: Iran, Turkey, and Americas Future. My guess is that the hostages would have been released even if someone else had been inaugurated -- anyone but Carter. The Iranians had come to hate Carter and didn't want to give him a triumph. Giving it to someone else was fine with them. Sick, the Columbia University professor, said that those who wish to believe that the final flurry of activity was out of fear of Reagan have a right to their opinion. Those closer to the events believed that the Iranians, who had clearly decided months earlier that the hostages were a wasting asset, feared that they would have to start the whole laborious process of negotiation over from scratch with a new administration, which obviously had no great appeal. The Romney campaign did not return an inquiry seeking backup for the candidates claim. Our ruling We cant read the Iranians minds, but seven scholars of the period told us that Reagans foreign policy approach was either a minor factor in the release of the hostages or not a factor at all. The fact that the deal was negotiated entirely by the Carter administration, without involvement by Reagan or his transition team, seems to support the expert consensus. Romney made a claim that flies in the face of history and offered no evidence to support it.",0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,False

Revolution Signal.,"President Donald Trump has promoted a big protest in Washington, D.C., on Jan. 6, when Congress is scheduled to certify President-elect Joe Bidens victory in the 2020 election. But an image being spread online is not a sign that the president is calling for a revolution. 1776 flag flying over White House! reads the headline on a Jan. 4 blog post on the Hal Turner Radio Show website. REVOLUTION SIGNAL. The post goes on to say that the 1776 flag is presently flying atop the White House in Washington, DC. It is the signal of REVOLUTION from our President! The time is here. The storm is upon us. Rise-up, America. Rise up against the fraudulent election. This post was flagged as part of Facebooks efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The flag in the photo is washed out, but the blog post seems to be referring to the 13-star flag, the first official U.S. flag to fly after the countrys founding in 1776. However, the photo isnt recent. Dan Scavino, the White House deputy chief of staff, posted it on Instagram on June 1, 2019. We didnt find any media coverage about the White House flying the 13-star flag around that time, and it was in the news. Nike pulled Fourth of July sneakers featuring the flag over concerns that it was a symbol for racism. We also found no evidence that such a flag is currently flying over the White House. But in any case, the image that purportedly shows an older flag that Trump raised to rally an uprising is more than a year old.

Final Rating: False","In the class of 1968 at Patrice Lumumba University in Moscow, Mahmoud Abbas was one of the members of that class, and so was Ali Khamenei. And that's where they first established relationships with the young Vladimir Putin.","It sounds like the opening to a joke: A young Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas, Iranian Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei and Russian President Vladimir Putin walk into a Soviet-era Moscow university  But its a claim that was made with a straight face by Republican presidential candidate Ben Carson -- on national television, three times. First, on the Oct. 5, 2015, edition of the Fox News show Hannity, Carson said Putinsrelationships go way, way, way, way back, you know? 1968 at Patrice Lumumba University -- that's when Putin first got to know the Ali Khamenei, and also Mahmoud Abbas. Then, on Oct. 8, Carson said much the same thing to CNN anchor Wolf Blitzer. Putin already has substantial ties in the Middle East, Carson said. In the class of 1968 at Patrice Lumumba University in Moscow, Mahmoud Abbas was one of the members of that class, and so was Ali Khamenei. And that's where they first established relationships with the young Vladimir Putin. And then again to Andrea Mitchell on MSNBC on Oct. 9: Putin has longstanding relationships with people in that area. In the class of 1968 at Patrice Lumumba University in Moscow, Mahmoud Abbas was in that class, and so was Ali Khamenei. And that was when they first became familiar with Putin. Really? Three future world leaders -- and three people many Americans consider adversaries -- found themselves kicking around a university in Moscow in 1968, building ties that would serve them decades later? We had to check it out. When we asked Carsons staff whether they had any supporting evidence, aide Ying Ma wrote back, Thanks for your inquiry. We are not in the habit of providing Googling support to the media. If there is a specific aspect of Dr. Carson's statement that you wish to challenge, please let us know and we can go from there. We did have difficulty finding any support for the claim, and we forwarded what we found to the campaign but did not hear back. Heres a rundown, point by point. Mahmoud Abbas The portion of the claim dealing with Abbas has the most supporting evidence, but even here its not all that clear-cut. Its fairly well documented that Abbas -- the head of theWest Bank-based Palestinian government -- did do some academic work in the Soviet Union. This part of Abbas biography gained some attention in 1995, when Abbas became a key Palestinian figure in the Oslo peace accords. Reports surfaced that Abbas had written a doctoral thesis in the early 1980s titled, The Other Side: The Secret Relationship between Nazism and the Zionist Movement. Critics, including the Simon Wiesenthal Center, criticized the thesis for seeming to minimize the Holocaust, and he later distanced himself from some of its conclusions. The importance of Abbas thesis for our fact-check is that it was presented at a Soviet university, variously described as Oriental College, the Institute of Oriental Studies or Moscow State University. Oddly, Wikipedia is the only source that citesPatrice Lumumba University, an institution of higher education in Moscow that was designed to serve an international student clientele and which has been linked by some observers to the KGB. (Its now known as Peoples' Friendship University.) We did track down one possibly credible source placing Abbas at Lumumba -- a 2010 article from Ria Novosti, a state-owned news agency. Contrary to popular myths, (Patrice Lumumba University) released from its walls not too many successful politicians -- about a dozen future ministers and only two future leaders of their countries, the article said. In addition to a president of Guyana, the article cited Abbas, who graduated from the law faculty, the article said. Still, a degree from Patrice Lumumba doesnt appear in most biographies of Abbas. He is more often listed as having earned his law degree (or in some tellings, a bachelors degree) from the University of Damascus. In addition, most bios place Abbas working for Palestinian organizations in 1967 and 1968. He would have been 33 in 1968, the year Carson cited. So what do we know about Abbas? We know for sure that he took short visits to Moscow to defend his doctoral thesis around 1982 (where, apparently, he always drank coffee with cardamom, according to a 2005 Russian media account by a former professor). Its also conceivable that Abbas had some connection with Patrice Lumumba University, though the evidence of that is equivocal. But theres no hard evidence that Abbas was at Lumumba in 1968, which is what Carson said. Ali Khamenei There is no mention in the official biography of Irans supreme leader that he ever studied in the Soviet Union, and the timeline thats known would have made it difficult for him to have done so. We did not hear back from the Iranian mission to the United Nations, but Ali Alfoneh, a researcher at the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies, looked into the question in 2012 when he was at the American Enterprise Institute. He wrote, According to Khameneis official biography, he travelled to Iraq in 1957 to study at the Theological Seminary in Najaf. Since the Peoples Friendship University was first established (as Lumumba) in 1960, the young Khamenei could not have used his journey to Iraq as a cover for his studies in the Soviet Union. On the other hand, Alfoneh continued, Khameneis biography says he spent a clandestine life in Tehran between March 1966 and March 1967, after which he was arrested by the police and imprisoned. The existence of this clandestine period may have fed the rumor that he spent time studying in Moscow. Certainly a period studying in the godless Soviet Union would be something Khamenei -- the head of a theocracy -- would want to keep under wraps. In an interview, Alfoneh said he isnt convinced of the Khamenei-in-the-Soviet-Union claim. I'm very skeptical, he said. So where did this rumor come from? The allegations garnered attention in 2010 when RT, a network tightly controlled by Putins Kremlin, aired a piece about the 50th anniversary of Peoples' Friendship University and mentioned in passing that Khamenei was an alumnus. (We tried to contact the university, but didnt get a response. Neither Abbas nor Khamenei is listed among the schools eminent graduates.) The earlier citations of this claim arent well sourced, either. It appears to have surfaced initially in a 1989 column by Smith Hempstone, a journalist and future U.S. ambassador to Kenya, that ran in a small, western Pennsylvania newspaper. We also found a brief article in a Russian newspaper from 2003 that mentions the claim in passing. None of these approximate a primary source. A half-dozen experts on the region unanimously told us that they doubted Khamenei ever studied in the Soviet Union -- or that he did so in 1968, when he would have been 29. I've never seen it corroborated, said Karim Sadjadpour, a senior associate at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. John Limbert, a professor of international affairs at the U.S. Naval Academy, called the idea bizarre. And David Houghton, a senior lecturer in the defense studies department at Kings College of London, called it unlikely in the absolute extreme. The Soviet Union is the absolute last place where one could expect to find Khamenei at any stage in his career, and I personally do not believe that he ever studied there or had any links to Putin, Houghton said. It looks like a rather daft conspiracy theory to me. Vladimir Putin The biggest problem for the Putin portion of Carsons claim is the calendar: In 1968, Putin would have been 16 years old. According to his official biography, in 1960-1968, Vladimir Putin attended Primary School No. 193 in Leningrad. After the eighth grade, he entered High School No. 281, a chemistry-focused magnet school under the aegis of a technology institute, completing his studies there in 1970. Its pretty difficult to imagine that he could have met Messrs. Abbas and Khamenei under any circumstances at age 16 in Moscow, unless he ran into them randomly on the street on some kind of school or family trip — if, indeed, they were actually there, said Fiona Hill, director of the Center on the United States and Europe at the Brookings Institution. In addition, Putin grew up in Leningrad (now St. Petersburg). That is a 9-to-10-hour car ride from Moscow and Patrice Lumumba University. He studied between 1970 and 1975 in the law faculty of Leningrad State University, saidRichard Sakwa, a professor of Russian and European politics at the University of Kent. The claim by Ben Carson is garbled rubbish. A defense The closest we came to any of this making sense was an interview with Cliff Kincaid, who runs a group called Americas Survival, Inc. Kincaid published a paper titled, Communists and Muslims: The Hidden Hand of the KGB that raises many of these claims. Kincaid made the case that Carson was saying Abbas and Khamenei could have been agents of the KGB, and if they were, Putin, who rose to colonel in the KGB, would have known them. Carson was clearly saying that Putin, as a former KGB colonel and later head of the FSB, the new name for the KGB, would have knowledge of Abbas and Khamenei attending Patrice Lumumba University, a KGB-controlled institution, Kincaid told PolitiFact. That made them subject to KGB influence, if not KGB agents. Whether Putin personally met them in his younger years is beside the point.  Please report these facts rather than nitpick Carson on the ages of the various players. We hereby report those facts. Still, this isnt what Carson said. Our ruling Carson said, In the class of 1968 at Patrice Lumumba University in Moscow, Mahmoud Abbas was one of the members of that class, and so was Ali Khamenei. And that's where they first established relationships with the young Vladimir Putin. This is one of the more bizarre claims weve heard so far in the 2016 presidential campaign, and thats saying something. Abbas may have attended the university, though we dont know for sure, or when. No credible evidence has yet surfaced to place Khamenei as a student in the Soviet Union -- ever, much less in close proximity to Abbas, or in 1968. And Putin would have been a teenager in 1968, attending school 450 miles away. The idea that the three men developed lifelong ties as students in the late-1960s-era Soviet Union is ridiculous.

An article on fake news website Politicono.com got that fact right but nothing else. The Dec. 3 article carried the headline, Sarah Palin Calls To Boycott Mall Of America Because Santa Was Always White In The Bible. The article quoted Palin as saying people should run the Mall of America into the ground, on the basis of Santa always having been white in the Bible, and, No, I refuse to believe that they went this far in trying to cater to the minorities, I thought the company had some backbone but I guess I was wrong, The former Alaska governor and 2008 Republican vice presidential candidate never said these things. Politicono.com, which calls itself a hybrid news/satire platform, takes real news hooks and builds fake stories on top of them. Every article has a show facts button to illuminate which parts of the story are real and those that are fabricated. When you click the show facts button on the Palin article, it highlights as fact the first paragraph, which is about the Mall of Americas real decision to hire a black Santa. But the entire rest of the article, detailing Palins supposed call to boycott the mall because of the Bibles teachings on Santa, is completely made up. Dear Democrats, this is what fake news actually looks like, and I guarantee you no Trump voter actually fell for this, Palin wrote on Facebook Dec. 20, with a link to a Breitbart article debunking the Politicono.com post. Politicano.com is more forthcoming than other fake news sites about the fact that it posts made-up content. But its still not immediately apparent that its editors fabricated the story claiming Palin said she would boycott the Mall of America because Santa was always white in the Bible.",0,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,False

Final Rating: False","Says Paul Ryan said that 22 million Americans choose to be poor, so its their own problem if they cant afford to be healthy.","A story that claimed House Speaker Paul Ryan said millions of people have willingly elected to be impoverished is fake news. A June 28, 2017, post on Politicot.com ran under the headline, Paul Ryan: 22 million Americans choose to be poor, so its their own problem if they cant afford to be healthy. Facebook users flagged the post as part of the social media sites efforts to fight fake news. The post started out with real comments Speaker Ryan, R-Wis., made on Fox & Friends on June 27 while discussing the Congressional Budget Office report for the Senates health care bill. What they're basically saying at the Congressional Budget Office is, if you're not going to force people to buy Obamacare, if youre not going to force people to buy something they dont want, then they won't buy it, Ryan said. So it's not that people are getting pushed off a plan. It's that people will choose not to buy something they don't like or want.) Then the Politicot.com story said Ryan launched into a tirade to Foxs Brian Kilmeade about how people should be able to provide for themselves and their families through hard work. Thats where the story turned to fiction. Being rich or poor is a matter of choice; thats all there is to it, Ryan is quoted. So, let me ask you this, Brian: if 22 million people consciously make the choice to not work hard day in and day out, why on earth should the rest of us be concerned with whether or not theyre going to be healthy? If they choose to be poor, then its their own problem if they cant afford to be healthy. Ryan didnt say that last part, because this story was posted on a parody site that makes up all manner of bogus news stories. We reached out to Ryans office but a spokeswoman did not give any comment on the fake quotes. Politicot.com is part of a network of sites related to Newslo.com, which refers to itself in a disclaimer as the first hybrid News/Satire platform on the web. The Politicot.com site is registered to an administrator named Eli Sompo, who runs sites based in Israel and Greece. Sompo has told us he did not write the stories on the websites for which he is responsible, but has several clients. He informed us months ago that he would block any future questions from PolitiFact about the sites. What makes Newslo.com-related stories especially confusing is that they use a small piece of real news or quotes by real people and build fake stories around them. In most cases it is the first paragraph of the story, as happened here. The websites feature a pair of buttons that allow readers to highlight the true parts of their stories, so readers can conceivably know the difference. But it isnt always obvious thats the aim, leading the audience to believe the entire story is true — especially when other fake news sites steal the articles and post them without any warning at all. Ryan did discuss how the Senates proposed legislation would affect poor people, but he never said 22 million people choose to be poor",0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,False

Final Rating: False",Says Jeb Bush has released 10 percent of his emails.,"Hillary Clinton might be in a bit of hot water for using a private email account for official business as secretary of state, but Democrats eagerly point to similar email issues with presumptiveRepublican presidential candidate Jeb Bush. As governor of Florida, Bush burnished his tech and public access credentials by using a personal email account to supplement the one the state provided. Prior to Clintons troubles, Bush set up a special website for the public to browse any of those emails that dealt with official business. Like Clinton, Bush himself determined which ones were private and which would be made public, but the move was largely seen as a way to mark Bush as a candidate who walks the walk when it comes to transparency. This led Democratic activist James Carville to challenge how transparent Bush really is. Jeb Bush has released 10 percent of his emails, Carville said on ABCs This Week, March 15, 2015. He had a private email server. He destroyed his emails. We decided to check Carvilles numbers. Carvilles assistant, Kees Nordin, gave PunditFact the underlying math. The fact is that of Jeb Bush's 3 million emails (public and private) he's only released 275,000 or just under 10 percent, Nordin said. According to Bushspokeswoman Kristy Campbell, Bush posted nearly 280,000 emails from his personal email account on a website he set up, jebbushemails.com. Back in 2007, Bush gave an off-the-cuff estimate that during his eight years in office he received about 550,000 emails at his personal address [emailprotected]. We tried to confirm that number, but Campbell said Its immaterial as they are not subject to public records request and not required by law to be retained. In the same interview in 2007, Bush said an additional 2.5 million emails came through other email accounts run by the state. So this is how Carville gets to a grand total of 3 million emails. The question is, did Bush reveal just 275,000 -- or 280,000 -- of them? The answer is no, because most of them have been, and remain, publicly available. Under Florida law, most of Bush's emails to his government accounts are a public record and accessible to people who request them, said Barbara Petersen, president of Floridas First Amendment Foundation. (The First Amendment Foundation advocates for government transparency and receives major support from foundations and Floridas news organizations, including the Tampa Bay Times.) Anything relating to public business is a public record in Florida, Petersen said. If you comment on a policy, even if the rest of the email is personal, it will be subject to a public records request. Its a fairly broad definition. Importantly, all of the emails sent to accounts run by the state would have been seen and vetted by state workers, not private staffers or lawyers employed by Bush. They remain the custodian of those records, andPetersen said shebelieves most of the Bush emails from his official accounts have been retained. The first stop for those emails would be the Citizen Services office, which fields all incoming communications to the governor. While some emails might be purely personal or otherwise exempt and would not be released, they were still part of the states public record. The point being, only the 550,000 emails sent to Bushs personal account would have remained under his exclusive control. The rest remain housed with the state government. What's the point? We can confidently say that the 280,000 emails on the Bush website represent just a fraction of the total number of emails that are public. While the precise figures are unclear, if 2.5 million emails went to one of the state-run email accounts then all of those were subject to a public records request. So in a rough sense, close to 90 percent of the universe of 3 million emailsare public in some form. If you look at just Bush's private emails, about 50 percent are public. Neither number is close to the one Carville cited. We reached out to state officials to see if they can add any information about the number of officialemails thatare part of Bush's record. Wewill update this item if we learn further details. A few notes Carville said Bush had a private email server. According to press reports, Bush used a server located in the governor's office. He took the server with him when he left office. Carville also said Bush destroyedthe emails he hadnt revealed. We asked how he knew that and got no reply.Petersen had the same question and noted that Florida law presents a hurdle to destroying emails. If you made a public record request of Jebs email and you thought you didn't get them all, you can file suit in civil court and request an in camera inspection by a judge, she said. Petersen said the state judges which records have archival value and which ones are trivial and can be disposed. Our ruling Carville said that Bush revealed 10 percent of his emails and he destroyed his emails. The numbers dont add up. The numbers used by Carville himself include 2.5 million emails sent to state run accounts. Those emails are subject to a public records request. It is completely inaccurate to say that Bush only revealed 275,000 or 280,000 emails out of a total of 3 million. A more accurate reading would be that he revealed about half of the emails sent to his private account, and the rest were already available to the press, although some might be held back if they were strictly personal in nature.",0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,False

A new rumor on Facebook suggests that environmental factors connected to climate change, like severe heat and drought, have nothing to do with the fires. Instead the post pins much of the destruction on one man. The Sept. 20 post features the mans mugshot and implores users to meet mr. climate change and says hes responsible for lighting 32 of the wildfires. The man in the image, Brandon McGlover, did light fires in California, and he was arrested and sentenced for it — but it happened in 2018, and there werent 32 fires. The post was flagged as part of Facebooks efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) In July 2018, deputies from the Riverside County Sheriff's Department in California arrested Brandon N. McGlover on charges of five counts of arson to wildland. (The amount of fires linked to McGlover was later upped to nine.) One of the fires McGlover was accused of setting became the Cranston Fire, which destroyed multiple buildings, forced thousands of evacuations, and burned over 13,000 acres before it was fully contained. Contemporaneous news reports said that a heat wave in California exacerbated the fires spread. McGlover pleaded guilty to arson charges for the Cranston Fire in 2019 and was sentenced to 12 years in prison. Fire officials and experts believe that the West Coasts 2020 wildfire season has been mostly fueled by a combination of severe drought, historic heat, lightning storms and heavy winds. RELATED: Climate change created conditions for the West Coast fires, experts say There are a couple of exceptions. A man was arrested on charges of arson and cultivating marijuana in connection with Californias Dolan Fire, and officials said San Bernardino Countys El Dorado Fire was caused by a device at a gender reveal party. A post suggests climate change has nothing to do with the fires burning in the Western U.S., blaming instead one man for setting 32 wildfires. That isnt true. Brandon McGlover was arrested in 2018 for lighting nine fires in southwest California and is currently serving a 12-year prison sentence. Also, experts say that climate change has modified environments in the West Coast, making them more conducive to wildfires.",0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,False

It was. Posted April 5, the tweet claimed that Pat Robertson believed he found the source of COVID-19 during an episode of The 700 Club. Robertson founded The 700 Club in 1966. He has hosted it since. The tweet is a screenshot of a quote. It says, Some of these young uns are doing all kinds of unnatural things with their sex organs. When people do that, they transfer all kinds of chemicals from ladies private parts and thats where I think the virus came from. We never had this kind of thing when I was coming up. But no one was committing oral sex back then. The tweet led to a Twitter trend for Pat Robertson and caused a spike in Google searches for Robertson. The quote has since been shared on Facebook and Reddit by angry users. Except Robertson didnt say it at all. The tweet was taken from a satire piece on The Business Standard News website. The Business Standard News is a satirical site designed to parody the 24-hour news cycle. The stories are outlandish, but reality is so strange nowadays they could be true, the sites about page said.

He founded the Christian Coalition and the American Center for Law and Justice, which was labeled as the Christian response to the ACLU. He founded Regent University.

Final Rating: False  ",Says Ivanka Trump was targeted in the Florida condominium building collapse.,"A conspiracy theory widely shared on Facebook claims that the partial collapse of an oceanside condominium building near Miami was actually an attack aimed at a high-value target — Ivanka Trump, daughter of former President Donald Trump. The claim, posted on the same day as the June 24 collapse, stated: Whatre the chances that the building collapse is 5 buildings south of Ivanka?  50 ppl still missing.. yup more and more convinced they were targeting hvt, if not also destroying evidence and/or closing tunnel entrances. USING THE TUNNELS UNDER THE HOTEL FOR SEARCH AND RESCUE. The building was in OK shape. The upscale condo near Miami Beach still collapsed Champlain Towers South Condo in Surfside near Miami Beach was completed in 1981. A recent condo sold for $710,000 at the oceanside. The post, which included photos of the collapse and a map indicating the proximity of Ivanka Trumps residence to that building, was flagged as part of Facebooks efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The day after the collapse, with search-and-rescue efforts still under way, officials said they did not know the cause of the collapse and that it would be some time before an investigation can try to find the cause. The Champlain Towers South, a 12-story condo building constructed in 1981 in Surfside, a town northeast of Miami, partially collapsed early on the morning of June 24. At a media briefing the next afternoon, Miami-Dade County Mayor Daniella Levine Cava said four people had died and 159 remained unaccounted for, but that the numbers were fluid. She said that although search-and-rescue efforts continue, structural engineers eventually would investigate what might have caused the collapse. Republican Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis also made it clear that it would take some time before an investigation of a possible cause can be fully undertaken. He said: We need a definitive explanation for how this could have happened, and thats an explanation that needs to be an accurate explanation, its an explanation that we dont want to get wrong, obviously, but at the same time I do think its important that its timely. Engineering and architectural experts told the New York Times it could take a long time to determine the cause of the collapse, but that possibilities include corroded components, an undermined foundation, or defects in the construction or design. Shimon Wdowinski, a professor in the Department of Earth and Environment at Florida International University in Miami, said the building showed signs of land subsidence — a gradual settling or sudden sinking of the Earths surface — in the 1990s, according to space-based radar data he analyzed. But land subsidence alone likely would not cause a buildings collapse, he said. Several engineering experts suggested a number of factors could have played a role, including saltwater corroding the concrete and potentially weakening beams that hold up the structure, the Miami Herald reported. Scientists have long noted the risk of building on the shifting sands of a barrier island such as Miami Beach, especially with rising sea levels, NBC News reported. That may not be the reason for this collapse, but it remains an engineering challenge in the region, the network said. According to news reports, the Miami home of Ivanka Trump and her husband, Jared Kushner, both of whom served as White House aides under Donald Trump, is a block away from the building that collapsed. The Wall Street Journal reported in January that the couple leased a condo at a building called Arte.",0,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,False

Final Rating: False  ","The COVID-19 vaccines make people magnetized. They can put a key on their forehead, it sticks. They can put spoons and forks all over them, and they can stick.","An anti-vaccine activist falsely claimed during a hearing with Ohio state legislators that the COVID-19 vaccines are magnetizing people who get them. Dr. Sherri Tenpenny, an Ohio-based osteopathic physician who wrote a book called Saying No to Vaccines, has been identified by the news site rating service Newsguard as a super-spreader of COVID-19 vaccine misinformation. A watchdog group found that she is one of 12 influencers responsible for 65% of anti-vaccine misinformation spread on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter. Tenpenny has previously pushed false claims that the COVID-19 vaccines can cause death and autoimmune disease, disrupt pregnancies and shed to affect unvaccinated people. Her latest comments came as she testified at the invitation of Ohios Republican lawmakers in favor of a bill that would prevent businesses or the government from requiring proof of COVID-19 vaccination, according to the Columbus Dispatch. Im sure youve seen the pictures all over the internet of people whove had these shots, and now theyre magnetized, Tenpenny said during the June 8 hearing. They can put a key on their forehead, it sticks. They can put spoons and forks all over them, and they can stick. Because now we think that theres a metal piece to that. Those claims are baseless. There are no metallic ingredients in any of the COVID-19 vaccines approved in the U.S. for emergency use, from Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna and Johnson & Johnson. The Food and Drug Administration has published the ingredients for each online. Theres nothing there that a magnet can interact with, Thomas Hope, a vaccine researcher at Northwestern University, previously told AFP Fact Check. Its protein and lipids, salts, water and chemicals that maintain the pH. Thats basically it, so this is not possible. PolitiFact and several other fact-checkers previously debunked the videos and pictures all over the internet that Tenpenny cited as proof, which purported to show magnets sticking to vaccinated people. The social media posts about vaccine magnetism were so widespread that the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention addressed them on its website: Can receiving a COVID-19 vaccine cause you to be magnetic? No. Receiving a COVID-19 vaccine will not make you magnetic, including at the site of vaccination which is usually your arm. COVID-19 vaccines do not contain ingredients that can produce an electromagnetic field at the site of your injection. All COVID-19 vaccines are free from metals such as iron, nickel, cobalt, lithium, and rare earth alloys, as well as any manufactured products such as microelectronics, electrodes, carbon nanotubes, and nanowire semiconductors. In addition, the typical dose for a COVID-19 vaccine is less than a milliliter, which is not enough to allow magnets to be attracted to your vaccination site even if the vaccine was filled with a magnetic metal. Florian Krammer, a professor of vaccinology at New York'sIcahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, previously told PolitiFact the claims about vaccine magnetism were utter nonsense. Other experts told AFP Fact Check that the metal objects highlighted in various online videos and images are likely sticking for other reasons. They could have tape or another adhesive on them, for example. Or they could appear to stick because of the oil on a persons skin. Later on in the Ohio House hearing, a nurse tried unsuccessfully to prove Tenpennys theory by positioning a key and a bobby pin against her neck. Explain to me why the key sticks to me. It sticks to my neck too, she said, even as the key she pressed to her neck did notstick.  Wow. An anti-vaccine nurse in Ohio tried to prove the Vaccines Cause Magnetism theory in an state legislative committee. The demonstration did not go to plan pic.twitter.com/0ubELst4E8 Tenpenny also claimed that there is some sort of an interface, yet to be defined interface, between whats being injected in these shots and all of the 5G towers, and that the vaccines have caused thousands of deaths in the U.S. Both of those claims are inaccurate. Tenpenny did not immediately respond to a request for comment from PolitiFact. She told the Washington Post that she stood by her testimony.

Final Rating: False  ","The House voted to cap insulin prices to $35/month, just $420 each year! Richard Hudson voted NO.","With inflation high and many Americans concerned about COVID-19, a Democratic congressional candidate in North Carolina says a Republican incumbent isnt doing enough to ease the burden of medical costs. State Sen. Ben Clark, D-Hoke, is running in the states newly-drawn 9th Congressional District, where hell face Republican U.S. Rep. Richard Hudson if both win their primaries. The district, which leans Republican, is located in south-central North Carolina near Fayetteville. On April 1, Clarks campaign emailed supporters slamming Hudson for how he voted the day before. The email said: Yesterday, the House voted to cap insulin prices to $35/month, just $420 each year! Richard Hudson voted NO. Clarks campaign also tweeted about Hudson, posting that he voted no to lowering the cost of insulin for every family in the 9th Congressional District. What legislation was Clark talking about? And did Hudson really vote against lowering insulin costs? A review of the record shows Clark got this wrong. The U.S. House of Representatives on March 31 voted on H.R.6833, known as the Affordable Insulin Now Act, which would cap insulin co-payments for insured Americans at $35 a month.It would help some Americans save hundreds of dollars annually and offer all insured patients more predictable insulin costs, but wouldnt help the uninsured, the Associated Press reported. The Democrat-led bill passed 232-193 with the help of 12 Republicans — and congressional records show Hudson was one of them. Several media outlets — including Business Insider, the Daily Mail and Yahoo! News — named Hudson among the bills Republican supporters. PolitiFact NC reached out to Clarks campaign shortly after it published the email and tweet about Hudsons vote. The campaign, which deleted its tweet about Hudson, defended its accusations. As far as we know, the Clark campaign hasnt issued a correction to its email. We are aware that last night Richard Hudson changed his vote on capping the cost of insulin to $35/month after voting against this and other bills to reduce the cost of prescription drugs numerous times, the campaign said. After being consistently rated as one of the most conservative Republicans in the House, no one is fooled by his recent shift to the center. We asked the campaign what it meant when it said Hudson changed his vote, but didnt receive a response. Hudsons office said the congressmans March 31 vote is in line with other efforts to reduce insulin prices. Jordan Shaw, one of Hudsons advisors, said Hudson co-sponsored the Lower Costs, More Cures Act of 2019, or H.R. 19, which would have capped the cost of insulin for some Medicare customers. Congressman Hudson was proud to vote to cap out-of-pocket costs for seniors on insulin, and has long advocated for caps on prescription drug costs like those in HR 19. He didnt change his vote, Shaw said. Clark said: Yesterday, the House voted to cap insulin prices to $35/month, just $420 each year! Richard Hudson voted NO. The congressional record and multiple media reports show Hudson voted yes.",0,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,False

Final Rating: False  ",The Democrat(ic) position on abortion is now so extreme that they dont mind executing babies AFTER birth.,"On Feb. 25, the Senate took up a bill backed by anti-abortion advocates called the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act. Under the bill, any infant born alive after an abortion or within a hospital, clinic, or other facility has the same claim to the protection of the law that would arise for any newborn, or for any person who comes to a hospital, clinic, or other facility for screening and treatment or otherwise becomes a patient within its care. The bill goes on to say that anyone (except the mother) who intentionally performs or attempts to perform an overt act that kills a child born alive can be prosecuted for intentionally killing or attempting to kill a human being. The bill failed on a procedural motion, with 53 votes in favor when 60 were needed to advance it. The only senators who crossed party lines were Democrats who voted in favor of the measure: Bob Casey of Pennsylvania, Doug Jones of Alabama, and Joe Manchin of West Virginia. Later that day, President Donald Trump registered his disappointment in a pair of linked tweets: Senate Democrats just voted against legislation to prevent the killing of newborn infant children. The Democrat position on abortion is now so extreme that they dont mind executing babies AFTER birth. This will be remembered as one of the most shocking votes in the history of Congress. If there is one thing we should all agree on, its protecting the lives of innocent babies. Senate Democrats just voted against legislation to prevent the killing of newborn infant children. The Democrat position on abortion is now so extreme that they dont mind executing babies AFTER birth.... Those are strong words. We wondered: Is it true that the Democrats vote against the bill mean that theydont mind executing babies AFTER birth? After interviewing a range of experts on both sides of the abortion-policy divide, we concluded that while Democrats have left themselves open to this line of attack, Trumps claim is inaccurate. (The White House did not respond to an inquiry.) Broadly, critics of the bill said that it would take decisions out of the hands of parents and medical professionals and hand it to politicians. Democrats also argued that the number of relevant cases is vanishingly small, and usually involve heartbreaking situations that often have specific, unusual factors at play that are hard to accommodate in advance. Because of this, they saw the bill as a chance for Republicans to embarrass Democrats rather than as a genuine piece of legislation aiming to solve a significant problem. Perhaps the Democrats most basic argument in the context of Trumps charge, however, is that laws already exist to cover the scenario the bill would seek to prevent, making the new bill redundant. In a floor speech before the vote, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said, It has always been illegal to harm a newborn infant. This vote has nothing—nothing—to do with that. Read the language. Sen. Patty Murray of Washington, the ranking Democrat on the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, echoed that argument. This bill is not about protecting infants, as Republicans have claimed, because that is not up for debate and it is already the law, she said. Most legal experts we contacted agreed with this much of the Democrats argument: Killing a baby after birth is already against the law. Actively killing an infant born alive is a crime, said Lois Shepherd, a professor of law and biomedical ethics at the University of Virginia and author of the books Rationing Health Care at the End of Life and If That Ever Happens to Me: Making Life and Death Decisions After Terri Schiavo. Under the law, living infants are just like other living people. They are children. Children are people. Legal experts pointed to several specific laws relevant to newborns: • The Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act, first passed in 1974 and subsequently revised, including major updates in the 1980s. The relevant portion of the law makes certain types of federal funding for states conditional on their adoption of policies to prevent improper withholding of treatment from newborns, including those with disabilities. • The Born-Alive Infants Protection Act of 2002 established that federal legal protections that applied to persons also covered children born at any stage of development, including after an abortion. The law did not directly create civil or criminal penalties, however -- something the 2019 bill would have added. Filling that omission was a key motivator for supporters of the bill. The 2002 law is toothless and purely symbolic, said Dwight Duncan, a University of Massachusetts law professor who serves on the the boards of the Pro-Life Legal Defense Fund and Massachusetts Citizens for Life. • State laws. State, rather than federal, laws are the primary source of protection against active or negligent killing of infants born during the process of abortion, said Teresa S. Collett, a law professor at the University of St. Thomas and director of the universitys Prolife Center. In 2002, Collett said, Congress identified 30 states that had some statutory protection for infants surviving an attempted abortion. Most states would allow prosecution of doctors for killing or failing to resuscitate after a live birth, said Douglas O. Linder, an emeritus law professor at the University of Missouri-Kansas City. In fact, the highest-profile case of this type was prosecuted under state laws: The 2013 trial of Philadelphia abortion doctor Kermit Gosnell, who was sentenced to three life terms for killing a series of late-term newborns in gruesome fashion. Not to provide standard newborn care for those infants that happen to survive an abortion and emerge breathing could be considered a form of negligent killing or homicide, Duncan said. Part of the reason that tensions over abortion have been heightened this year is the consideration of bills in two states -- New York and Virginia -- to ease some of the state-level rules governing abortions, particularly late-term abortions. (We previously fact-checked a statement by Trump about the Virginia bill and another about the New York bill.) Critics of the Democratic position on the Senate bill say the redundancy argument is a fig leaf for political considerations. If Democrats agree with the overall principle, the argument goes, there is little harm in passing a law that reinforces existing statutes. Personally, I do not think it credible for Democrats to say they are against executing babies after birth if they are unwilling to provide criminal and civil penalties to abortion doctors that kill babies that survive abortions, nor provide equal standard of medical care for such babies, Duncan said. It is a largely rhetorical strategy to get out of an embarrassing position. There is a long tradition in Congress by both parties of putting forward bills that seek to force the other party into casting awkward votes. This law would fall into that category, said Mary Ziegler, a Florida State University law professor and author of the books Beyond Abortion: Roe v. Wade and the Fight for Privacy and After Roe: The Lost History of the Abortion Debate. The Senate bill mostly appealed to Republicans because it would put Democrats in a difficult political situation, Ziegler said. Polls show that most Americans are uncomfortable with later abortions, much less anything after a live birth. Focusing on this issue is strategically savvy, even if it would make very little difference to the overall number of abortions. On the other hand, experts agreed that Trumps use of the word executing grossly exaggerated the Democratic position. My impression is that the term execution is generally reserved for public application of the death penalty, Duncan said. Merriam-Websters definition of execution agrees. It says the word refers to a putting to death, especially as a legal penalty. Certainly the deaths envisioned by the recent bill arent carried out as a legal penalty. In reality, both sides agree that active killing of a breathing newborn is -- and should be -- illegal. There is a broad consensus that a child that takes its first breath has crossed a bright line from fetus to child and should be protected by the law, Collett said. This is a clear-cut concept that we can all agree upon, said Gretchen Ely, an associate professor at the University of Buffalos School of Social Work and a board member for Social Workers for Reproductive Justice. The notion that anyone supports executing infants after birth is preposterous. More complicated are cases in which the newborn is so severely disabled that they may not survive beyond a few days. Many abortions that occur later in pregnancy involve fetal anomalies incompatible with life, such as anencephaly, the absence of the brain and cranium above the base of the skull, or limb-body wall complex, when the organs develop outside of the body cavity, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists has written. A failure to resuscitate, which is typical in such cases, is a much more contentious issue, said Arthur Caplan, a bioethicist at New York University Langone Medical Center. Babies born post-abortion, spontaneous or induced, with horrible and potentially painful conditions incompatible with life, would not be routinely resuscitated or aggressively treated by most medical teams. In fact some would not even know how to try, or lack the technology to do so, especially in rural areas. Caplan said he is unaware of examples of medically active killing, and that while allowing to die does happen, it occurs very rarely—say, a baby born with no lungs at 20 weeks. In such a scenario, Trumps image of an execution is hyperbole, experts said. I do not have a clue what is meant by executing after birth, said Leslie Francis, director of the Center for Law and Biomedical Sciences at the University of Utah who also serves as a member of the ethics committee of the American Society for Reproductive Medicine and previously served as a director of the Disability Law Center. Trump said, The Democrat(ic) position on abortion is now so extreme that they dont mind executing babies AFTER birth. Theres little question that the vote on the Senate bill was uncomfortable for Democrats: They effectively voted against a bill whose principles they said they support, arguing that the bill would be redundant because those principles are already enshrined in law. However, Trump overreached when he described Democrats as tolerating executing newborns. No one supports actively killing newborns, much less executing them; the contested terrain concerns what efforts should be made to extend the lives of babies who are not expected to survive long with severe disabilities.",0,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,False

Final Rating: False  ","An Environmental Protection Agency regulation that goes into effect Jan. 1, 2012, regulates dust.","It was the kind of question that any politician who opposes big government would love to field during a GOP presidential debate.My question is, if you were forced to eliminate one department from the federal government, which one would you eliminate and why? asked a man from Arlington, Va., via YouTube during the Sept. 22 debate in Orlando.A moderator chose metro Atlantan Herman Cain to answer it, and to the delight of the audience, he turned his hypothetical ax on a favorite target of big government foes: the Environmental Protection Agency.Now, I know that makes some people nervous, but the EPA has gone wild. The fact that they have a regulation that goes into effect Jan. 1, 2012, to regulate dust says that they've gone too far, Cain replied.Dust? The EPA will start regulating dust in January?We contacted the Cain camp for evidence, but they didnt reply. Fortunately, the EPA posted its reports on the issue online. Factcheck.org, a fact-checking operation similar to PolitiFact, looked into Cains comment as well.We found that the EPA has long regulated a category of air pollution called particulate matter, which includes dust. Theres no new regulation scheduled for Jan. 1, 2012.Particle pollution is a floating mix of solid particles and liquid droplets. Sometimes, the particles are visible, like smoke from a power plant, haze, or the dust that Cain mentioned. Other times, theyre so small theyre invisible to the naked eye. These particulates can be made up of any number of chemicals, and can come from a variety of sources such as smokestacks, fires or construction sites.A growing body of scientific evidence links particle pollution to a variety of health problems, including respiratory issues, lung disease, heart problems and even higher death rates, according to multiple independent reviews of the scientific literature as well as the EPA.A small number of studies have even linked naturally occurring dust storms to a rise in trips to the emergency room for cardiovascular problems, according to an EPA review of scientific studies. The EPA has regulated this form of air pollution since 1971 under the Clean Air Act, and requires air monitors in areas with populations greater than 100,000, according to state and federal documents. But it does not specifically single out farm dust for regulation.Since states have to comply with the regulations or risk losing federal money, they may institute rules for farm dust to get into compliance with the law, a lobbyist for the farm industry and news accounts confirm. The Clean Air Act requires the EPA reviews its particle pollution standards every five years. And thats where the current dust-up over dust began.The EPA released its most recent policy assessment in April. It concludes that based on the newest research, its worthwhile to consider tightening some standards on larger or coarse particulates. This category includes dust from landfills, construction sites, agriculture and industrial sources such as steel mills.The agriculture industry and other groups objected, saying this suggestion doesnt make sense for rural areas, where tractors and pickups kick up naturally occurring dirt in the fields or on unpaved roads.But both the EPA and regulation opponents agree that no regulation is in the pipeline, and its certainly not coming Jan. 1.Factcheck.orgs Sept. 23 story on the debate noted that EPA Administrator Lisa Jackson testified before the U.S. House Committee on Agriculture in March that it was a mischaracterization that the EPA is trying to expand regulation of dust from farms.Indeed, the EPA has not formally submitted new regulations for review, an agency spokeswoman told PolitiFact Georgia. Jackson said she would make a decision on whether to tighten the rules in July, according to a Reuters news story, but she has yet to do so.Even if the EPA were to submit such regulations today, it could take a year or so for them to go into effect, said Richard Krause, a lobbyist for the American Farm Bureau Federation. The EPA would have to make any proposal available for public review and comment, a process that could take some months.So to sum up:The EPA has been regulating large particulate matter, including dust, for four decades, but does not single out farm dust or require monitoring in more rural areas.EPA staffers and scientists concluded after an assessment of the most recent science that its worthwhile to consider tightening current regulations, but the EPA has not formally proposed any regulation, and even if they did so today, it could take a while for it to go into effect.So, Cain does have a point. The EPA does regulate dust under the Clean Air Act. But Cains language was very specific, and now that the dust has settled in the wake of the Republican debate, its clear his specifics were incorrect.Dust is regulated, but not at all in the way that Cain described. We therefore rate his statement False.",0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,False

Final Rating: False  ",ACORN will be a paid partner with the Census Bureau and they will be in charge of going door-to-door and collecting data from the American public.,"Rep. Michele Bachmann sparked a new controversy recently when she declared she would provide the bare minimum to Census takers because she was concerned about the Census Bureau's partnership with ACORN, a left-leaning group that has become a popular villain for Republicans. (You remember ACORN: Formally known as the Association of Community Organization for Reform Now, it was lambasted in 2008 by many Republicans because its voter registration efforts included some fraudulent names such as Mickey Mouse. ACORN leaders said they discovered the fake names, notified authorities and fired some workers who cut corners. But Republican leaders still say it was a willful effort to manipulate the election to help the group's liberal agenda.) Here's how Bachmann explained her concerns in aWashington Timesinterview (which you can listen tohere): Now ACORN has been named one of the national partners, which will be a recipient again of federal money, Bachmann said. And they will be in charge of going door-to-door and collecting data from the American public. This is very concerning because the motherload of all data information will be from the Census. And, of course, we think of the Census as just counting how many people live in your home. Unfortunately, the Census data has become very intricate, very personal (with) a lot of the questions that are asked. And I know for my family the only question that we will be answering is how many people are in our home. We won't be answering any information beyond that, because the Constitution doesn't require any information beyond that. Bachmann packs a lot of bad information into a short space there. So in this item we'll deal with her latest claim about ACORN, and we'll deal with her claim about the constitutional requirement witha different item. She is wildly wrong with her chraracterization of the Census Bureau's partnership program. Yes, the bureaudoespartner with organizations to help recruit workers. To date, it has 30,000 such partners. ACORN is one. Partners agree to promote the 2010 Census among their constituents. As a partner, ACORN has agreed to spread the word among its people about the availability of temporary Census jobs. The U.S. Census Bureau expects to hire 1.4 million people through the course of the 2010 census, the bulk of them to do the door-to-door questionnaires, so the bureau casts a wide net to get applicants, including through its partners. Partners don't get paid, but they presumably benefit by getting the word out to members about jobs, and also by providing a public service emphasizing the importance of filling out the Census. According to Census Bureau information provided to Congress on June 1, 2009, ACORN and other partner organizations simply promote the availability of temporary Census jobs, but have no role in the terms or conditions of employment beyond promotion of the availability of temporary jobs. Applicants that are hired by the Census Bureau to work on the 2010 Census are required to go through a background check that includes an FBI name check and fingerprint check so that felons are not hired to work on the 2010 Census. Partners are also encouraged to donate testing space for the millions of people who will apply for the temporary Census jobs. No payments are made for that. And lastly, partners are asked to promote full participation in the Census among their members, through newsletters, e-mails, local meetings etc. Again, there's no payment for that. So let's count the ways Bachmann is wrong: ACORN will not be in charge of going door-to-door and collecting data from the American public, as Bachmann said. The U.S. Census will be in charge of that. Some of the 1.4 million people who get Census-taking jobs may learn about the job through ACORN. Workers who apply to the Census through ACORN have no better shot at the job than those who apply through any of the 30,000 other partners. That's it. And despite Bachmann's claim, ACORN gets no money for signing on as a partner. Once again, she is making a scaremongering claim about ACORN with facts that are ridiculously wrong. So we have to set the meter on fire once again. She earns another Pants on Fire.",0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,False

Mukwege did resign, but it wasnt for those reasons. Mukwege is a Congolese gynecologist and surgeon who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2018 along with Nadia Murad for their work to end the use of sexual violence as a weapon of war. The post displays a photo of Mukwege and claims he said this about resigning from the team: I cannot in any case dirty my Nobel Peace Prize for money, we had been ordered to declare any illness to be coronavirus and any death. In addition, the thing that displeased me is that, after more than 100 samples none came out positive. I have a career to protect and I am Congolese by blood. Getting rich by lying is a sin before God, I quit. The quote is fake. Mukwege said he resigned because of problems that included inadequate preventive measures and inefficient testing. The post was flagged as part of Facebooks efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Mukwege served as vice chairman of the Multi-sectoral Coronavirus Response Committee and president of the Health Commission, which were established in Congos South Kivu province to handle its COVID-19 pandemic response. Mukwege released a statement about his decision to resign from the committee on June 10 on the website for the Panzi Foundation, a charitable organization he founded. He said the decision was due to slow testing, problems implementing a response strategy and inadequate preventative measures. We are therefore at the start of an exponential epidemiological curve and we can no longer apply a strategy that would only be preventive, Mukwege wrote. I therefore decided to resign from my duties as Vice-President of the Multi-sectoral Coronavirus Response Committee in our province and President of the Health Commission, in order to devote myself entirely to my medical responsibilities and to treat this influx of patients at Panzi Hospital. A Panzi Foundation spokesperson also confirmed to PolitiFact that the quote is fabricated. On Twitter, Mukwege said any statements posted in his name were not genuine unless they appeared on his official social networks or websites.

According to what looks like a news headline being shared online, NASA discovered tetrahydrocannabinol, or THC —the stuff that gets marijuana users high — on a meteorite fragment. A team of astrophysicists at the University of Hawaii have created somewhat of a stir within the scientific community after the discovery of trace amounts of Tetrahydrocannabinol, reads the text below the headline. The post also cites a website: thehealthdisorder.com. This post was flagged as part of Facebooks efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) We reached out to NASA about the post but didnt hear back. The University of Hawaii system has three universities, and we contacted the two where we found physics departments. University of Hawaii at Mānoa didnt respond to our questions about the post, but apparently this news that caused a stir within the scientific community didnt reach the chair of the physics and astronomy department at the University of Hawaii at Hilo. I cant help you on this one, Dr. Kathy Cooksey said. We found a Google listing for the story on thehealthdisorder.com, though when we clicked on the link the website was dead. And we didnt find any credible news stories corroborating the headline in the post. But it appears its been online for several years now. In 2016, High Times Magazine reported that it seemed to originate on a website that publishes fake news stories. In the end, we found no evidence that NASA discovered THC on a meteorite fragment",0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,False

Final Rating: False  ","It was (Rob Portmans) job to stop Chinas illegal dumping of steel. He failed, looked the other way, did nothing."," Ted Strickland goes back 11 years in an ad targeting incumbent Ohio Sen. Rob Portman, chastising his role as U.S. trade representative under President George W. Bush. It was his job to stop Chinas illegal dumping of steel, the narrator says. He failed, looked the other way, did nothing. Titled Beltway Rob, the ad is part of an ongoing name-calling battle between the Strickland and Portman campaigns. (Portman mocks Strickland as Retread Ted.) Stricklands ad left us wondering if Portman dropped the ball on foreign steel during his year as trade representative. (Dumping in trade speak typically refers to a country introducing a cheaper-than-normal product into a foreign market and edging out domestic manufacturers.) Was it really his job to stop Chinas illegal steel dumping, and did Portman really do nothing to stand up for the United States? Stricklands campaign pointed us to a 2012 Politico article about potential running mates for Mitt Romneys presidential bid. Portmans name was on the short list, the article said, but a chapter in Portmans trade history could be leveraged as a weakness by Democratic opponents. We turned to the trade wonks for more clarity. Role of trade representative So was it Portmans job to stop China's illegal dumping of steel?  In a word, no. Like a lot of political ads, its more complicated than the ad is saying, said Warren Maruyama, who served as general counsel for the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative under Portmans successor, Susan Schwab. The trade representatives job is to act as the governments spokesperson on trade, negotiate trade agreements, file cases with the World Trade Organization on behalf of domestic interests and defend against cases where those interests are challenged, and to oversee coordination with the alphabet soup of other agencies whose interests overlap with trade, Maruyama said. Trade law is arcane, and its easier to yell China bad! than it is to explain its nuances. But to a trade experts ear, it makes no sense to say that Portman failed to stop illegal Chinese dumping. Its like saying LeBron James failed to score any touchdowns last season — that's thewrong sport. Likewise, the law is very clear that the U.S. trade representative has no role in the determinations on unfair trade practices such as dumping. Determinations regarding dumping are made by the Commerce Department and the U.S. International Trade Court, in procedures which are deliberately shielded from political or outside interference. Its walled off from political considerations, and Portman could have gotten into trouble if hed tried to interfere, Maruyama said.  If dumping is proven, its an unfair trade practice for which relief is mandatory. The U.S. International Trade Commission decides if there is injury or the threat of injury, and the Commerce Department determines the appropriate relief, through higher tariffs. Alan Wolff, who was deputy special representative for trade negotiations during President Jimmy Carters administration, agreed. Portman had no role on anti-dumping, he said. Thats flat-out wrong. The attack ad copy is conflating two different issues, Wolff said. The case referenced by Politico, the one that the Strickland ad wants to use as proof of Portmans inaction on Chinese dumping, didnt involve market-dumping at all. The case at hand is different In August 2005, American makers of circular welded non-alloy steel pipe, which is often used in home-building, filed for relief from market disruption under Section 421 of the Trade Act of 1974. Market disruption is not the same as dumping. Trade experts draw a firm distinction between the two terms.(When theWall Street Journalmischaracterized a similar 2009 market disruption case as a dumping case, the paper rana correction.) There is a clear difference, Maruyama said. The thing about dumping is it sounds bad, so people throw it around, but its just not accurate. Section 421 is a unique and rarely used statute, according to Schwab, who took over for Portman after Bush tapped him to head the U.S. Office of Management and Budget. Cases under this statute for market disruptionfall under a category of safeguard considerations, where it is not necessary for the petitioner to prove wrongdoing, only that a trade action has caused them injury, or threat of injury. Its a way of bypassing a formal dumping hearing by the trade commission, Schwab said. Section 421 cases are also unique in that they require approval from the White House. The president, the law says, must determine whether trade relief measures are in the countrys economic interest, or could threaten national security. In October 2005, the International Trade Commission issued its determination on the steel pipe case. Four of six trade commissioners sided with the steel pipe manufacturers and recommended tariffs and safeguard actions be imposed on Chinas pipe imports. Two commissioners dissented, finding no market disruption. Here, it was Portmans job to coordinate the process where representatives from other agencies weigh in. They all sit down and argue, Maruyama said, and if they have a consensus, thats the recommendation that goes up to the president. If there are differences, and often there are, it goes over to the White House in a memo summarizing all the pros and cons. And then Bush gets to decide.  Portman had a Cabinet role in this occasion, but Schwab said Bush was very clear that there was only one decider in his administration. It wasnt a Portman-Bush decision, she said. It was a Bush decision. Bush did not impose relief in this case, or in three other 421 cases that crossed his desk when Portman wasnt his trade representative. In the steel pipe case, Bush said that relief wasnt in the national economic interest. He believed that punishing China on steel pipe wouldnt ultimately help U.S. steel manufacturers. There are many other countries currently supplying standard pipe to the U.S. market that could fill the void created by curtailed Chinese imports, wrotePortman in a February 2006 letterto Sen. Blanche Lincoln, D-Ark., one of many lawmakers catching heat from angry steel industry constituents. Schwab called attacks on Portmans record on China ironic. Portman was always my strongest ally when I wanted to take the Chinese to the WTO, she said. He was a hawk on these issues. If I wanted to file trade enforcement cases on China I could always count on him. Our ruling Stricklands ad says that it was Portmans job to stop Chinas illegal dumping of steel. He failed, looked the other way, did nothing. We consulted trade experts on both sides of the partisan aisle. They were unanimous that the ads statement is fundamentally wrong.Portman did not have a role to play in anti-dumping measures as U.S. trade representative. The 2005 trade matter that the ad attacks him over had nothing to do with dumping. This case only reached Portman, and ultimately Bush, because it was filed underanother part of trade law that triggers presidential involvement that isn't used for true dumping cases. Andif you switched Bush for Portman in this ad, it would still be a cynical twisting of words. Dumping is not a catch-all for Chinese steelinthe market.",0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,False

Final Rating: False  ",James Comey Memos just out and show clearly that there was NO COLLUSION and NO OBSTRUCTION,"President Donald Trump claimed that memos written by former FBI Director James Comey show clearly that the Trump campaign did not collude with Russia during the 2016 election, and that Trump has not obstructed justice amid ensuing investigations. Comey, who Trump removed as FBI director in 2017, made detailed notes following seven encounters with Trump. Comey had testified before Congress about portions of the memos, but they became public in their entirety for the first time on April 19, which prompted Trump to claim the memos cleared his name. James Comey Memos just out and show clearly that there was NO COLLUSION and NO OBSTRUCTION, Trump tweeted.  James Comey Memos just out and show clearly that there was NO COLLUSION and NO OBSTRUCTION. Also, he leaked classified information. WOW! Will the Witch Hunt continue? Comey has said he made written records of his meetings with Trump in part due to concerns the president might lie about their discussions. Here, Trumps tweetbadly mischaracterizes their contents. Nowhere in Comeys memos does he say that Trump did not collude or obstruct justice. Lets recap how the memos came to be. In July 2016, when Comey was still FBI director, the FBI opened a counterintelligence investigation into links between the Trump campaign and the Russian government. After Trump was elected, Comey made contemporaneous notes of seven discussions he had with Trump. On May 9, 2017, Trump fired Comey as FBI director. From this point forward, Comey would have no role investigating Trump campaign ties to Russia. Later that month, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein appointed former FBI Director Robert Mueller as special counsel. Mueller was authorized to lead the investigation into possible connections between the Trump campaign and Russian officials, as well as other matters that may arise directly from the investigation. (Rosenstein was acting as attorney general in place of Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who recused himself from the investigation.) Heres the key point: After the reins were passed from Comey to Mueller, the investigation into contacts between the Trump campaign and Russia escalated dramatically. Comey wasnt in any position to make definitive statements about whether collusion existed or not. To date, Muellers investigation has swept up four members of Trumps campaign, including three who have agreed to work with Muellers team as part of a plea deal. Muellers probe is ongoing, and he has yet to issue a final determination on the collusion question. The idea that the memos exonerate Trump on charges of obstruction of justice is even weaker. For starters, Comeys memos contain details that many experts would consider legally relevant in an obstruction case against Trump. The memos describe a one-on-one dinner with Trump on Jan. 27, 2017, at the White House, where Trump turned the conversation to whether Comey wanted to stay on as FBI director. Comey has said he suspected Trump was seeking a patronage relationship with him. Comeys memo goes on to state that Trump explicitly requested his loyalty later that evening, saying, I need loyalty, I expect loyalty. The memos also describe a private meeting at the White House the following month, in which Trump asked Comey to drop the investigation into former national security adviser Michael Flynn, saying, I hope you can see your way clear to letting this go. Finally, two days after Comeys ouster, Trump said in a nationally televised interview that hed been thinking about the FBIs Russia investigation when he fired Comey. When I decided to just do it, I said to myself, I said you know, this Russia thing with Trump and Russia is a made-up story, Trump told NBCs Lester Holt. As in the case of the collusion question, Mueller has yet to issue a final determination on whether Trump obstructed justice. Even when the Comey memos are read in a light most favorable to Trump, they still dont support his claim that the writings exonerate him. Comeys memos show Trump repeatedly asking for his help to lift the cloud being cast over his presidency by the Russia probe. Comey writes that he reassured Trump multiple times that the FBI was not investigating him. But Comeys final memo was written more than a year ago, before Mueller ramped up the investigation and before Trump admitted he had been thinking about the Russia investigation when he fired Comey. More recently, Comey addressed the investigation in his memoir A Higher Loyalty, where he holds open the possibility of criminal wrongdoing: One of the pivotal questions I presume that Bob Muellers team is investigating is whether or not in urging me to back the FBI off our investigation of his national security adviser and in firing me, President Trump was attempting to obstruct justice, which is a federal crime. Its certainly possible. There is at least circumstantial evidence in that regard, and there may be more that the Mueller team will assemble. Trump said the Comey memos show clearly that there was no collusion and no obstruction of justice. Nowhere in Comeys memos does he say that Trump did not collude nor obstruct justice. And in the year since Comey penned his last Trump memo, a special counsel has been appointed who has escalated the investigation. That investigation has resulted in other charges against four members of Trumps campaign, including three who have agreed to plea deals. In his book, Comey writes that thememosand the circumstances of his firingmay be legally relevant to an obstruction case against Trump. Comey has also held open the possibility that Trump may ultimately be found to have committed criminal wrongdoing. ",0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,False

Final Rating: False  ",Says giving Motrin and Robitussin together can cause heart attacks in children.,"Dubious medical advice is not only plentiful on social media – its persistent. Such is the case for a decade-old email chain that warns against giving children a combination of Motrin and Robitussin, because they may have a heart attack. One example of the claim, which has been popping up in email inboxes since at least 2008, has gotten over 115,000 shares on Facebook and says that an 8-year-old girl named Madison passed away after she was allegedly given both medications: This was sent to us from a nurse in our district  thought Id pass along just as an FYI. Motrin and Robitussin dont mix!!! Madison, age 8, passed away just a few days ago. Weve been asked to pass this on. Doctors told her family that there have been quite a few children Madisons age that have died recently the same way that she did. The only common link between them was that they were given Motrin (ibuprofen) and Robitussin together, this caused a heart attack. They believe this is what happened to them. They told her to alert everyone to this. Do not give children both of these medicines together. You can give them one or the other but not both. When Madison collapsed she suffered a heart attack and they were able to revive her but the loss of oxygen damaged her brain and she was put on the respirator. After this she had four strokes before she died after being taken off the respirator. Please pass this on !!!!!!!!! The bottom of the post has the email signature: Lisa Lopez M.A. Childrens Medical Center of Dallas Pulmonary Clinic. The post was flagged as part of Facebooks efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) This rumor is just that –– a rumor. There is no evidence to suggest that a Motrin-Robitussin combination causes heart attacks in otherwise healthy children. The Childrens Medical Center in Dallas, Texas, that appeared in the email signature came out to dispel the rumor in 2010, roughly a year after it started being shared. The hospitals announcement said the following: In 2009, a Childrens employee received the e-mail from a friend and inadvertently forwarded it from a work account. Because the employees professional signature was included at the bottom of the e-mail, the information appeared to come from a reliable source at Childrens Medical Center. This is not the case. All medications have side effects, the hospital noted, and parents of children with underlying medical conditions must always be vigilant about the medications their child is taking. The hospital statement advised parents to consult with their childrens doctor or a pharmacist before mixing any over-the-counter drugs. The Childrens Medical Center also addressed the rumor in a tweet on Dec. 22, 2014: Facebook post about Motrin & Robitussin is not correct & was not posted by one of our employees. The tweet linked to a 2009 fact-check by Snopes on the topic. Its important to note that the Food and Drug Administration does not recommend children under the age of two be given cough-cold medications. But the agency has not issued any warnings that the ingredients in Motrin (which contains ibuprofen) or Robitussin (which contains dextromethorphan and/or pseudoephedrine or sometimes chlorpheniramine) could cause heart attacks in children when combined. These ingredients are also in many other medications on the market, yet the chain email only singles out Motrin and Robitussin. If the danger of heart attacks, strokes or death was prevalent in the combination of two commonly used medications, health officials would have issued widespread public health warnings. Motrin alone is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug, and according to the FDA, the labels of over-the-counter versions warn that for adults and children (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs), except aspirin, increase the risk of heart attack, heart failure, and stroke. These can be fatal. The risk is higher if you use more than directed or for longer than directed. Ashley Turney, an FDA spokesperson for over-the-counter drugs, told PolitiFact that use of Robitussin products, with or without Motrin, is not associated with heart attacks. She described Robitussin as an umbrella brand containing a series of childrens cough and cold products that may contain a single ingredient or combinations of dextromethorphan hydrobromide, guaifenesin, phenylephrine hydrochloride, or chlorpheniramine maleate. The recommended use, dosing, and warnings vary amongst the seven Robitussin products that are intended for use in children over 4 or 6 years, she said. Turney noted that its important for people to read the drug facts label directions for all over-the-counter medications. An old rumor claims combining Motrin and Robitussin can cause heart attacks in children. There is no evidence that giving both of these medications to children causes heart attacks. Children who are too young or have underlying medical conditions can experience adverse side effects from taking any combination of over-the-counter medicine, health officials say. Parents are recommended to talk with their childs health care provider, or a pharmacist, if they have any questions about mixing medications. This rumor is False.",0,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,False

Final Rating: False  ","Rep. David Cicilline is responsible for the federal loan guarantee to Solyndra, the failed solar company","Theres been a lot of finger-pointing lately in Washington over the Obama administrations 2009 decision to give a $535-million federal loan guarantee to Solyndra, a now-defunct solar power manufacturer.The Republican-controlled House has launched an investigation into how the Department of Energy could guarantee such a large loan to a company that would file for bankruptcy only two and a half years later. What sort of examination of the California start-up companys finances did the government do before taking such a big risk?According to a news release we received the other day, the National Republican Congressional Committee has found a scapegoat for the debacle: U.S. Rep. David N. Cicilline, Democrat of Rhode Island.Once the poster child for David Cicilline's stimulus boondoggle, the bankrupt Solyndra company is now a symbol of how his failed scheme wasted taxpayer money on political payback and failing companies instead of creating the jobs promised, the Jan. 13 release said.The NRCC sent out the release in response to a Washington Times report that senior Solyndra executives were set to receive bonuses despite the companys troubles.Its outrageous enough that David Cicilline supported a $1-trillion failed stimulus package, but its even more outrageous that hundreds of millions were spent to fund a failing company like Solyndra, NRCC communications director Paul Lindsay went on to say in the release. Not only is Cicilline responsible for this irresponsible investment, but hell also have to explain to his Rhode Island constituents why Solyndras senior employees are receiving bonuses at the expense of hard-working American taxpayers.Weve heard a lot of allegations in connection to Solyndras problems, but never one laying the blame at Cicillines doorstep. This puzzled us because Cicilline took office in 2011, well after the federal stimulus package that financed Solyndras loan guarantee was passed and well after the decision was made to award Solyndra the loan guarantee. How could he be responsible?We checked the NRCCs website and saw that the same news release had been sent out to 49 other Congressional districts, but each time, the name of the Democrat in office was inserted where Cicillines name was. (The Democrats included Rep. Bill Keating, of Massachusetts, who also took office in 2011).We then called the organization seeking an explanation of how Cicilline made it on the list. (Curiously, Rep. James R. Langevin, Rhode Islands other congressman who is also a Democrat, wasnit on the list even though he was in office at the time the stimulus bill was passed and voted for it.)An NRCC spokesman said the release was accurate because Cicilline voiced support for the stimulus package when he was campaigning for Congress.I think the important thing to note is we didnt say Cicilline voted for the stimulus, Nat Sillin said. We say he supported it.Its true that Cicilline did back the stimulus package. When he was mayor of Providence, he was quoted numerous times saying that the bill would create sorely needed jobs.And although its technically true that the release didnt say that Cicilline voted for the stimulus, it did say that hes responsible. That didnt add up to us. Lets run through some dates to make it clear why:Feb. 13, 2009: Congress passes the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. Under the $787-billion stimulus package, Solyndra received its loan guarantee.March 20, 2009: Solyndra receives conditional approval for the loan guarantee, according to a timeline from the Department of Energ,.Sept. 3, 2009: The Department of Energy makes the final decision to approve the loan guarantee for Solyndra.Nov. 2, 2010: Cicilline elected to Congress.Jan. 5, 2011: Cicilline takes office.Our rulingThe full name of the legislation under which the stimulus package was approved gives this one away -- the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009.Cicilline took office in January 2011, a full 23 months after passage of the bill enacting the loan guarantee program that benefited Solyndra.The National Republican Congressional Committee has every right to call the stimulus a boondoggle. And its fair to say that Cicilline supported the stimulus before taking office.But Lindsay said that Cicilline is responsible for this irresponsible investment. No, hes not.Wed say that Lindsay and the National Republican Congressional Committee simply used overheated rhetoric, but thats an understatement. Their claim is so wildly inaccurate that we give it a Pants on Fire. (Get updates from PolitiFactRI on Twitter.

Final Rating: False  ",Accuses President Barack Obama of making contradictory claims about efforts to kill Osama bin Laden in 2008 and 2011.,"A reader recently forwarded us a chain e-mail thats been making the rounds, accusing President Barack Obama of hypocrisy over the raid that resulted in the killing of al-Qaida leader Osama bin Laden on May 1, 2011. A Google search also indicated that the text of the e-mail has been popping up widely in blogs and comment threads. Heres the full text of the version we received:Here are the facts, you be the judge. These words were spoken by the same man in 2008 and then again in 2011.Short and sweetOBAMA'S OWN WORDS TRAP HIM: 2008: Navy Seal Team 6 is Cheney's private assassination team.2011: I put together Seal Team 6 to take out Bin Laden.2008: Bin Laden is innocent until proven guilty, and must be captured alive and given a fair trial.2011: I authorized Seal Team 6 to kill Bin Laden.2008: Guantanamo is entirely unnecessary, and the detainees should not be interrogated.2011: Vital intelligence was obtained from Guantanamo detainees that led to our locating Bin Laden.I HOPE THIS GETS SENT AROUND TO PEOPLE WHO CARE ABOUT THE TRUTH!We thought wed look into whether the quotations in the e-mail were accurate. We did extensive searches on Google, in the Lexis-Nexis news database and the White Houses own website, as well as checking with a few experts. The White House did not respond to our query.While its impossible to prove a negative, we found no evidence to support the notion that Obama said any of these things. In fact, several of the statements are directly contradicted by the evidence we found.Well take the quotes one by one.2008: Navy Seal Team 6 is Cheney's private assassination team.We found occasional references in the media to assassination teams that were answerable to Vice President Dick Cheney, but no evidence that Obama ever said anything of the sort.In a March 11, 2009, speech at the University of Minnesota, veteran investigative reporter Seymour Hersh referred to the Joint Special Operations Command -- a special wing of our special operations community that is set up independently, as he put it. They do not report to anybody, except in the Bush-Cheney days, they reported directly to the Cheney office. ... Congress has no oversight of it. Its an executive assassination ring essentially....Later, during the July 15, 2009, edition of Countdown with Keith Olbermann -- a now-defunct nightly show on MSNBC -- the liberal host introduced a segment by saying that it was time to look at what we know about the Bush-Cheney assassination teams. The segment addressed purported assassination efforts under both the CIA and the Pentagon. The latter sent killing teams into the field, where they actually killed people, including those affiliated with al-Qaida, Olbermann said.Almost two years later, such comments became somewhat prescient, when details of the bin Laden raid became known. The counter-terrorist team that carried out the raid was the Naval Special Warfare Development Group, or DevGru for short. (The team is popularly, though incorrectly, known by one of its several former names, SEAL Team Six.) DevGru has been around since the early 1980s, usually shrouded in secrecy given its sensitive work. According to globalsecurity.org, it is a component of the Joint Special Operations Command.From whats been reported, its unclear whether DevGru truly was answerable to Cheney during his two terms as vice president. But the group existed, and the bin Laden raid certainly suggests that it has the ability -- at least in some cases -- to act as an assassination team.Still, the e-mail is wrong to suggest that Obama ever said or wrote that Navy Seal Team 6 is Cheney's private assassination team before he became president (or, for that matter, after).2011: I put together Seal Team 6 to take out Bin Laden.During his May 1, 2011, announcement of bin Ladens death, Obama detailed his role in ordering the bin Laden raid. But he never claimed that he had created the unit that carried out the raid (which he didnt, in any case).Obama said in his announcement that shortly after he took office, I directed Leon Panetta, the director of the CIA, to make the killing or capture of bin Laden the top priority of our war against al-Qaida, even as we continued our broader efforts to disrupt, dismantle, and defeat his network.  Last week, I determined that we had enough intelligence to take action, and authorized an operation to get Osama bin Laden and bring him to justice.Today, at my direction, the United States launched a targeted operation against that compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan. A small team of Americans carried out the operation with extraordinary courage and capability. No Americans were harmed. They took care to avoid civilian casualties. After a firefight, they killed Osama bin Laden and took custody of his body.In a lengthy interview conducted on May 4, 2011, Obama sounded a similar note.Obviously we have extraordinary guys, Obama told Steve Kroft of the CBS newsmagazine 60 Minutes. Our Special Forces are the best of the best. And so I was not involved in designing the initial plan. But each iteration of that plan they'd bring back to me. Make a full presentation. We would ask questions. We had multiple meetings in the Situation Room in which we would map out -- and we would actually have a model of the compound and discuss how this operation might proceed, and what various options there were because there was more than one way in which we might go about this.We did not find any evidence that Obama had claimed to have created the special forces team that carried out the raid.2008: Bin Laden is innocent until proven guilty and must be captured alive and given a fair trial.Obama never said this. In fact, he took the opposite stance in one of the presidential debates in 2008.If we have Osama bin Laden in our sights and the Pakistani government is unable or unwilling to take them out, then I think that we have to act, and we will take them out, Obama said. We will kill bin Laden. We will crush al-Qaida. That has to be our biggest national security priority.The closest we could find was a comment -- quickly retracted -- that was made in 2003 by Howard Dean. Dean, the former governor of Vermont, was running for the Democratic presidential nomination at the time.In December 2003, Dean told the Concord Monitor that he had resisted pronouncing a sentence (on bin Laden) before guilt is found. I still have this old-fashioned notion that even with people like Osama, who is very likely to be found guilty, we should do our best not to, in positions of executive power, not to prejudge jury trials.After a flurry of condemnations, Dean reversed course just a few hours later. He told the Associated Press that, as an American, I want to make sure he gets the death penalty he deserves. He also issued a statement that said in part, Bin Laden has admitted that he is responsible for killing 3,000 Americans as well as scores of men, women and children around the world. This is exactly the kind of case that the death penalty is meant for.2011: I authorized Seal Team 6 to kill Bin Laden.Obama didnt use the phrasing cited in the chain e-mail, but as we indicated earlier, theres no question that he took responsibility for ordering the raid.There is evidence that U.S. forces would have accepted a surrender by bin Laden, rather than killing him, under certain circumstances. After the raid, according to ABC News, State Department legal adviser Harold Koh wrote in a blog post that forces were prepared to capture bin Laden if he had surrendered in a way that they could safely accept in accordance with the laws of armed conflict which require the acceptance of a genuine offer of surrender, clearly communicated by the surrendering party under circumstances where it would be feasible for the forces to accept the offer of surrender.Still, Koh wrote that bin Laden was a lawful target under the Authorization for Use of Military Force passed by Congress in 2001. It allows military force against those that have planned, authorized, committed or aided the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001.2008: Guantanamo is entirely unnecessary, and the detainees should not be interrogated.This statement has a grain of truth, but it is exaggerated.During the campaign, Obama made no secret of his disagreement with elements of the Bush Administrations national security policy. He promised to close the detention facility at Guantanamo (which we have rated a Promise Broken) and to end the use of torture without exception (which we have rated In the Works).Obamas desire to close Guantanamo could be construed as him believing that the facility is entirely unnecessary, but its wrong to say that he believed that detainees shouldnt be interrogated. Interrogation is a standard procedure in law enforcement and intelligence. Obama wanted to end the use of torture.We also found no evidence that Obama uttered these words.2011: Vital intelligence was obtained from Guantanamo detainees that led to our locating Bin Laden.Some, including Cheney, have suggested that the Bin Laden raid benefited from intelligence gained through interrogation techniques that Obama has criticized as torture. This question has not been definitively settled, although the White House downplayed the possibility.Reporting from detainees was just a slice of the information that has been gathered by incredibly diligent professionals over the years in the intelligence community, White House spokesman Jay Carney said on May 3, 2011. And it simply strains credulity to suggest that a piece of information that may or may not have been gathered in -- eight years ago somehow directly led to a successful mission on Sunday. That's just not the case.John Pike, the director of globalsecurity.org, said that the words attributed to Obama on Guantanamo are ludicrous. It is not something he would have said, and there is no evidence that it is something that he did say.And in this case too, we found no evidence that Obama uttered the words attributed to him. As you may know I have been critical of Obama's national security policies, said Professor Jeff Addicott, director of the Center for Terrorism Law at St. Mary's University School of Law. That said, I have never heard him make the 2008 remarks, and I follow him very closely.Our ruling A few of the sentiments have some link to reality – Obama did order the raid to kill bin Laden, and he did oppose Guantanamo, even though he ultimately failed to carry through on his promise to close it. The critics may have wished Obama had made these statements, but appears the statements have no basis in reality. It's clear from our research that all six quotes are fabrications. Once again a widely circulated chain e-mail is spreading ridiculous falsehoods about Obama.",0,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,False

Final Rating: False","An ongoing audit of the 2020 presidential election in Arizona showed Trump ahead by 250,000 votes, and nearly 950,000 ballots are declared illegal, nearly all for Biden.","In the 2020 election, 3,385,294 votes were cast for president in Arizona, and Donald Trump lost the state to Joe Biden by just 10,457 votes — 49.36% to 49.06%. Six months later, a livestreamed but opaque audit of ballots from the states most populous county is under way in a 14,870-seat arena. And posts on social media falsely suggest that the audit showed Trump was overtaking Biden. A widely shared Instagram post claimed: Preliminary audit showed Trump ahead by 250,000. Now as it nears completion nearly 950,000 ballots are declared illegal. Nearly all for Biden. The post was flagged as part of Facebooks efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Theres no preliminary results, Ken Bennett, Arizonas former secretary of state and a liaison for the Senate Republicans who ordered the audit, told PolitiFact on May 6. Theres no such finding. Theres been no findings released to either of those effects. The audit, begun April 23, will likely to continue for at least 60 days, Bennett said. He added that under the contract for the audit, no preliminary findings are to be released. A spokesperson for the audit did not reply to our email. Final official results of the November election showed Biden beat Trump in Maricopa County, 1,040,774 votes to 995,665, or by about 2% of the vote. So the Instagram claim would have you believe that the audit found roughly 90% of Bidens votes were illegal. The Maricopa audit was ordered up by Republican state senators, even though the original result has been validated by a hand-count sample audit and a forensic audit of tabulation equipment that found no abnormalities. The GOP hired a team that included Cyber Ninjas, a Florida-based technology company lacking election audit experience. Cyber Ninjas is headed by Doug Logan, who promoted stop the steal conspiracy theories about the election that culminated in the Jan. 6 Capitol attack. The conservative One America News Network, which has aired falsehoods about the 2020 election, set up a nine-camera livestream for the audit, which is being conducted at Veterans Memorial Coliseum in Phoenix. But Cyber Ninjas policies and procedures were released only after a judge ruled that the firm couldnt keep them secret. Reporters initially were restricted from taking notes or filing reports. The false claim follows others that weve debunked about purported findings from the audit. We also rated False a claim that the audit is confirming the rumors that real ballots have a special watermark.

Final Rating: False  ",The war in Ukraine is scripted and staged.,"Russias military invasion of Ukraine has brought on an onslaught of attacks, injuries and deaths for more than a week. But according to one claim on Facebook, the war is fake. The Feb. 25 post showed a photo of the Joker from the Batman film, The Dark Knight', with text overlaid that read, Them: Lets pray for Ukraine! Me: Its all scripted and staged. The accompanying text post read, Russia and Ukraine is a coverup! and linked to a nine-minute YouTube video that falsely claimed the war is a coverup to distract from COVID-19, which it says was also planned and staged. The post was flagged as part of Facebooks efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) First off, COVID-19 is real. PolitiFact named claims to the contrary its 2020 Lie of the Year. Statistical data, hospitals, medical workers, news reports and more show that the pandemic is authentic, and has caused millions to get sick or die. As for war in Ukraine, daily evidence proves that there is indeed a war. During the early morning of Feb. 24, after months of increased Russian military presence near the Ukrainian border, President Vladimir Putin announced the invasion into Ukraine in a televised speech, calling it a special military operation. Following Russian missile strikes on Feb. 24, 2022, a destroyed car, damaged radar and equipment are shown at a Ukrainian military facility outside Mariupol, Ukraine. (AP Photo) Before the Russian invasion, numerous Ukrainian civilians volunteered to become fighters and took part in military training. Now, theyre on the frontline. NPR, The New York Times and other news sources have extensively covered the situation in Ukraine, where journalists and citizens have transmitted images depicting the war effort. This picture, my God. https://t.co/8m2EDk8cBb pic.twitter.com/YW8dZ2fI04 The exact number of civilians killed is unknown, but as of March 2, Ukraines State Emergency Service estimated more than 2,000 Ukrainians dead, according to CNN. On March 4, the United Nations gave a lower count of 331 people killed, including 19 children, and 675 who were injured. But the real toll is likely to be much higher, Liz Throssell, U.N. spokesperson, said. The U.N. reported that most civilian deaths in the first eight days of conflict were caused by the use of explosive weapons with a wide impact area, including shelling from heavy artillery and multi-launch rocket systems, and missile and air strikes. Russia has also reported casualties. The Russian Defense Ministry announced that 498 Russian troops have died and 1,597 more have been injured, NPR reported. With the impact of the war on civilians being publicly reported, and both sides reporting troops deaths and injuries, the claim that any of this is being staged proves to be baseless. Even more evidence that the conflict is real: the swift response from other countries. NATO has stated they will not engage in the war, but have taken other means of action against Russia. The United States, the European Union and the United Kingdom have joined together in implementing harsh economic sanctions against the Russian economy. During his State of the Union Address on March 1, President Joe Biden announced that, in addition to cutting off Russia's largest banks from the international banking system, the U.S. will join our allies in closing off American air space to all Russian flights – further isolating Russia – and adding an additional squeeze on their economy. The value of the ruble, Russias currency, has fallen to less than one U.S. cent. Rising prices on some products like electronics and appliances have caused citizens to stock up, and NPR reports that arrests of anti-war protesters in Russia are racking up. They cite a Russian human rights group called OVD-Info, whove counted more than 8,000 arrests. Wealthy elites, who also face sanctions, have criticized Putins invasion of Ukraine. Scott Radnitz, an associate professor of Russian and Eurasian studies at the University of Washington, viewed the Facebook post and video, and said that the claim hinges on a world domination conspiracy theory — but there is no evidence presented for why or how the war is being staged. There is little to refute directly, other than to note that thousands or millions of people would have to be in on any conspiracy to fake a war, and like the 9/11 attacks (which some people also deny) there is substantial video footage of attacks on Ukrainian cities, Russian invading forces, and throngs of refugees, Radnitz said. Nevertheless, he added, a true believer will persist in denying all that evidence, something that is easier to do when the conflict is geographically distant and they do not personally know anyone directly affected by it. With a war raging, the world responding and both sides of the conflict experiencing its effects, the claim that the Russian invasion of Ukraine is scripted and staged holds no merit",0,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,False

Final Rating: False  ",An anonymous e-mail says that Hillary Clinton advocates communism.,"An anonymous chain e-mail maligns Hillary Clinton in the form of a gotcha-style quiz. The quiz lists six quotations, then asks which famous communist said it. Choices include Karl Marx, Josef Stalin, Mao Tse-tung and other Nazis, fascists and dictators. (We'll leave aside as a minor quibble the fact that communism and Nazism are completely different political philosophies.) Every quotation includes a none of the above option. At the end of quiz, the punch line is thatallthe answers are none of the above — Hillary Clinton said those things! Get it? The problem with the quiz is that every statement is either taken out of context or edited to look worse than it is. In none of the circumstances was Clinton advocating communist-style government for the United States or socialistic economic policies. In some instances she was criticizing out-of-control government spending or the excesses of Big Business; at other times she was saying that complicated issues will require political consensus. Let's look at the quiz items one by one. • From the chain e-mail: We're going to take things away from you on behalf of the common good. This is from 2004 remarks that Clinton made to a roomful of Democratic donors, some of whom paid $10,000 to attend the function, according to the Associated Press. She was discussing the need to end the Bush tax cuts in order to balance the budget. Her full quote was, We're not coming to you, many of whom are well enough off that actually the tax cuts may have helped you, and say 'We're going to give you more.' We're saying, 'You know what, for America to get back on track and be fiscally responsible, we're probably going to cut that short and not give it to you. We're going to take things away from you on behalf of the common good. '  • From the chain e-mail: It's time for a new beginning, for an end to government of the few, by the few, and for the few. ... And to replace it with shared responsibility for shared prosperity. In this one, Clinton was giving a speech in May 2007 attacking the economic policies of the Bush administration. She slammed subsidies for oil and gas companies, tax incentives for companies that move jobs overseas, and excessive CEO pay, according to a report in theConcord (N.H.) Monitor. Notice the italicized phrases that were left out of the chain e-mail quote: It's time for a new beginning, for an end to government of the few, by the few and for the few.Time to reject the idea of an on-your-own societyand replace it with shared responsibility for shared prosperity.I prefer a we're-all-in-it-together society. • From the chain e-mail: (We) ... can't just let business as usual go on, and that means something has to be taken away from some people. Clinton was speaking at a forum on religion and public life hosted by CNN in June 2007. This quote was in reply to a question from a Catholic priest, who asked, In an age in which there is, oftentimes, narrow and excessive individualism, how will you speak to our country about the need for sacrifice, restraint, when it comes to the critical issues of taxes, gun control, health care, and energy consumption? Here's Clinton's more complete response about energy: You know, we can't keep talking about our dependence on foreign oil and the need to deal with global warming and the challenge that it poses to our climate and to God's creation and just let business as usual go on. And that means something has to be taken away from some people. • From the chain e-mail: We have to build a political consensus and that requires people to give up a little bit of their own ... in order to create this common ground. This quote is from the same CNN forum and question mentioned above, but on the health care issue. Clinton's full quote is a little more verbose and concerns the uninsured: I think we could reach that agreement, and then we would have to start doing the hard work of deciding what we were going to do to make sure that they were not uninsured, because an uninsured person who goes to the hospital is more likely to die than an insured person. I mean, that is a fact. So what do we do? We have to build a political consensus, and that requires people giving up a little bit of their own turf in order to create this common ground. • From the chain e-mail: I certainly think the free market has failed. This might be the most egregious of the quiz quotes, because it's taken from a long list of institutions that Clinton says have failed to help kids make good decisions. Clinton was responding to a question, again at the CNN forum, about how antiabortion and proabortion forces can work together to reduce abortions. Clinton said it was important for everyone to help teens make better decisions: We have so many young people who are tremendously influenced by the media culture and by the celebrity culture, and who have a very difficult time trying to sort out the right decisions to make. And I personally believe that the adult society has failed those people. I mean, I think that we have failed them in our churches, our schools, our government. And I certainly think the, you know, free market has failed. We have all failed. • From the chain e-mail: I think it's time to send a clear message to what has become the most profitable sector in (the) entire economy that they are being watched. Clinton's target here was oil companies. She alleged that they were gouging consumers by raising prices after Hurricane Katrina hit New Orleans, according to a 2005Washington Poststory. I think it's time to send a clear message to what has become the most profitable sector in our entire economy that they're being watched, she said in explaining her call for an inquiry by the Federal Trade Commission. I think human nature left to itself is going to push the limit as far as possible, and that's what you need a government regulatory system for: to keep an eye on people to make the rules of the game fair, to make a level playing field and not give anybody some kind of undue advantage. So is Hillary Clinton advocating communism? Hardly. The masked e-mailer hopes you might think so after reading a political tyrants' Hall of Fame list alongside truncated quotes about taking things away and the collective good. We give the mock quiz a failing grade, with extra points deducted for unabashed fearmongering. Its argument that Clinton advocates Marxism is not just False, it's Pants-on-Fire wrong.

Final Rating: False  ",Most likely the primary control knob (for the earths temperature) is the ocean waters and this environment that we live in.,"Energy Secretary Rick Perry downplayed the role of human activity in the recent rise in the Earths temperature, saying natural causes are likely the main driver of climate change. Perry was asked in a CNBC interview if he believed carbon dioxide was the primary control knob for the earths temperature. No. Most likely the primary control knob is the ocean waters and this environment that we live in, Perry said in the June 19 interview. We decided to investigate Perrys claim about climate changes main cause, which scientists have likened to a control knob. Perrys claim flies in the face of settled science. The worlds leading authority on climate change, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, has concluded that human activity is extremely likely to be the main driver of warming since the mid 20th century. While its still possible to find dissenters, scientists around the globe generally agree with this conclusion. The graph below, based on work by NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies, shows just how closely human activity syncs with the earths rising temperature, especially since 1950. The blue line shows how human factors (land use, ozone, aerosols and greenhouse gases) have contributed to global warming. The black line is the Earths recorded temperature since 1880.  This is not to say natural factors dont affect the climate. They do. But Perry is wrong to call them the main cause of the earths rising temperature. When you look at how natural causes (orbital and solar changes plus volcanic activity) have contributed to climate change, its clear the impact is less than that of human factors.  Perry is also wrong to say ocean waters are responsible for the uptick in temperature. While oceans are a vital part of the climate system, and variations in their circulation can affect local climates in important ways, they dont account for global warming, said Gavin Schmidt, climatologist and director of NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies. We have concluded close to all of the recent trends in global temperature is due to human activity, and CO2 is the dominant factor, Schmidt said, referring to carbon dioxide. Perry misidentified climate changes main control knob, but hes not the first Trump administration department head to fudge the facts on our warming planet. We previously issued a False rating to Environmental Protection Agency chief Scott Pruitts claim that carbon dioxide is not a primary contributor to the global warming that we see. In fact, carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas that collects in the earths atmosphere and traps excess heat. It has functioned like a primary control knob thats been dialed up dramatically since humans began releasing significantly more amounts of CO2 into the air, mostly by burning fossil fuels, at the dawn of the Industrial Revolution. A reasonable analogy can be drawn between the way that atmospheric CO2 controls the global temperature of the Earth, and how your house thermostat controls the temperature of your house, said Andrew Lacis, a climatologist at NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies. The NASA graph below shows the influence of greenhouse gas emissions, including a 40 percent increase in atmospheric CO2 since 1750 (green line), on the Earths temperature (black line).  Energy Secretary Rick Perry said, Most likely the primary control knob (for the earths temperature) is the ocean waters and this environment that we live in. Perrys claim contradicts settled science. While natural factors certainly affect the climate, human factors are the main contributor to global warming, and carbon dioxide has acted as the primary control knob governing the earths relatively recent uptick in temperature.

Final Rating: False",Under the Obama plan . . . all the health care in this country is eventually going to be run by the government.,"When Sen. Tom Coburn said that under President Obama, all the health care in this country is eventually going to be run by the government, it was like a golden oldie PolitiFact has heard many times before. During the campaign, we heard the same tune from vice presidential candidateSarah Palin, who said Obama was calling for a government-run plan;Mitt Romney, who said Obama wants the government to take over health care; andRudy Giuliani, who called Hillary Clinton's similar plan socialized medicine.) Coburn, an Oklahoma Republican, made his remarks while criticizing Obama on a different matter. Obama is moving to rescind Bush administration rules that protected medical workers from performing procedures such as abortion that conflicted with their religious or moral beliefs. Coburn, who is against abortion, said rescinding the order would be only a first step for the Obama administration. Remember, under the Obama plan . . . all the health care in this country is eventually going to be run by the government, Coburn said in an interview on Fox News on March 4, 2009. So it's part of an incremental creep towards eliminating any objection, both as us as taxpayers and then individual physicians in terms of not complying with a government-run bureaucracy, he added. Coburn and Obama can fairly disagree about conscience protections for health care workers who oppose abortions. But he's wrong that Obama's plan offers government-run health care. In fact, Obama's plan leaves in place the private health care system, but seeks to expand it to the uninsured. It increases eligibility for the poor and children to enroll in initiatives like Medicaid and the State Childrens Health Insurance Program, and creates pools for individuals to buy their own cheaper insurance. It also outlines strategies to rein in costs for everyone, such as electronic medical records and preventive care. I think most of us would agree that if we want to cover all Americans, we can't make the mistake of trying to fix what isn't broken, Obama said at a health care conference he hosted on March 5. So if somebody has insurance they like, they should be able to keep that insurance. If they have a doctor that they like, they should be able to keep their doctor. They should just pay less for the care that they receive. Would Obama's plan result in closer regulation of the health care system? Very likely so. It includes provisions that require health insurance companies to cover pre-existing conditions and disclose more information about how they treat patients. Obama's plan also calls for evidence-based health care standards, so that government can stop paying (through programs like Medicare) for treatments that don't get good results. But the plan is very different from some European-style health systems where the government owns health clinics and employs doctors. We asked Coburn's office about his remarks. What matters is not just President Obamas intent, or what his plan states, but the likely effect and consequences of his plan, said spokesman John Hart. Under Obamas approach, the only plans left standing will be those controlled by the government. That may be Sen. Coburn's opinion on what could happen, but it's definitely not part of Obama's plan. And Coburn was very specific in saying that under the Obama plan, all the health care in this country is eventually going to be run by the government. That gives the incorrect impression that Obama is promoting a government-run health care system. He's not.",0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,False

Final Rating: False  ","In eighth grade math, weve fallen to ninth place.","In his first major education speech, President Obama endorsed charter schools, merit pay for teachersand increases in school spending. He justified his agenda partly by saying American students are slipping compared to counterparts around the world. We've let our grades slip, our schools crumble, our teacher quality fall short, and other nations outpace us, Obama said in the March 10 speech to the United States Hispanic Chamber of Commerce. In eighth grade math, we've fallen to ninth place. Since Obama brought up math, we decided to check his. Turns out we had to pull out the red pen. We asked the White House to defend Obama's claim, and received no response. His claim that eighth grade math studentsin the United States are in ninth place internationally almost certainly comes from the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study, a periodic comparison of math and science achievement carried out since 1995 by research institutions and government agencies worldwide. Themost recent study, published in 2007, did indeed show U.S. eighth graders in ninth place behind five East Asian countries and Hungary, England and Russia. But it was misleading to say they had fallen to ninth place. In 1995, theycame in 28th. In 1999, theymoved up to 19th. In 2003, they climbedto 15th. So rather than falling, U.S. students have actuallyimprovedin the past decade. We considered giving the president partial credit since American students did come in ninth. But the point of his statement was that they had fallen to that position and that mathematics performance in the United States is getting worse relative to other countries.

Final Rating: False",The Democrat-backed health care reform plan will require (Americans) to subsidize abortion with their hard-earned tax dollars.,"In an already contentious health care debate, the last thing the Obama administration wants is a fight over abortion. The word abortion was never mentioned in the initial health care plans released by the House and Senate. The decision of whether to offer abortion coverage in the proposed public plan, then, would be left up to the health and human services secretary. Abortion opponents said that would allow Democrats to slip abortion into the plan as part of the standard coverage. In an op-ed piece on July 23, House Republican Leader John Boehner of Ohio repeated the concerns of many who oppose abortion that the Democratic-backed health care reform plan will require (Americans) to subsidize abortion with their hard-earned tax dollars. Although there are several versions of the health care bill kicking around in Congress, one thing has now become clear: Most envision a government-run health plan option that could include abortion coverage, as well as a health care exchange in which participating private insurance companies would be permitted to offer such coverage. But does that mean that federal tax dollars would be used to subsidize abortions? That's a more difficult question. Let's back up a minute and explain some background: Currently, the 1976 Hyde Amendment prohibits the use of federal funds for abortions through Medicaid except in cases of rape, incest or when the mother's health is in peril. So states that want to offer abortion coverage have to pay for it themselves. Similar restrictions on public funding for abortions applies to federal health care coverage extended to active and retired military and federal employees. President Barack Obama gave a nod to that precedent when asked in a July 21 CBS interview with Katie Couric whether he favored a government option that would cover abortions. Obama said, As you know, I'm prochoice. But I think we also have a tradition of, in this town, historically, of not financing abortions as part of government-funded health care. Rather than wade into that issue at this point, I think that it's appropriate for us to figure out how to just deliver on the cost savings, and not get distracted by the abortion debate at this station. Abortion opponents had hoped similar restrictions to those in the Hyde Amendment would be placed on any government-run health care option, and also be extended to any private insurance companies that participate in the government-sponsored health care exchange, which will provide health insurance for people who don't get it through their employer. To that end, Rep. Bart Stupak, D-Mich., offered an amendment to the House health care proposal that would prohibit the use of public money to cover any part of the costs of any health plan that includes coverage of abortion. The amendment was narrowly defeated. Donna Crane, policy director for NARAL Pro-Choice America, called Stupak's proposal a radical departure from the status quo, because millions of women who currently have private insurance plans that cover abortions would be stripped of that coverage if their plan ultimately became part of the exchange — which seems likely. According to a 2002 Guttmacher Institute study, 87 percent of employment-based insured health plans offered coverage for abortions (though not all companies select it for their employees). A 2003 Kaiser Family Foundation survey found that 46 percent of covered workers had coverage for abortions. The two surveys asked different questions, but the bottom line is that a significant percentage of women currently have health insurance that covers abortions. And so began the debate over how to make the health care reform bill abortion neutral. A compromise plan offered by Rep. Lois Capps, D-Calif., which passed the House Energy and Commerce Committee, seeks to alleviate many of the concerns expressed by abortion opponents — particularly the issue of tax dollars being used to subsidize abortions — while specifically making abortion coverage available in both the public plan and in private plans participating in the exchange. Under the Capps amendment: • Abortion coverage would not be part of the required minimum benefits package. In other words, insurers would not be required to offer, or be prohibited from offering, abortion services in order to participate in the exchange. • The public plan could include abortion coverage, but the cost of the additional coverage could not be paid through public subsidies (tax dollars), only through the premiums paid by the insured. And with private plans in the exchange, again, federal subsidies could not be used for abortion coverage. • Public funding would only be permitted for abortions allowed under the Hyde Amendment — in cases of rape, incest or when the mother's life is in danger. • At least one plan in every region must offer full abortion coverage; and one must not. • Any insurance plan participating in the exchange cannot discriminate against hospitals or other health care facilities (such as Catholic hospitals) that are unwilling to provide abortions. • The plan will not pre-empt any state laws regarding abortion, such as parental notification laws. Douglas Johnson, legislative director for National Right to Life, said the amendment is hardly a compromise, and the pledge not to prohibit the use of public funds amounts to little more than symbolic bookkeeping. The Capps amendment may claim to segregate funds used for abortions, he said, but the bottom line is you have the government paying subsidies to people who are then able to obtain abortion coverage. And, he said, It's still the government running the whole plan. The government would be participating in the killing of unborn children under the guise of a health care plan, Johnson said. But that's not the opinion of all antiabortion groups. Chris Korzen, executive director of Catholics United, which opposes abortion, said his group doesn't want to see an important health care plan derailed by a misleading campaign that claims the health care plan would mean taxpayer-subsidized abortions. The goal should be to maintain the current policies, Korzen said. That Capps amendment accomplishes just that. It specifically prohibits taxpayers' funding of abortions. It disappoints me that there are people who are still making that claim. And, he said, there's a lot to be happy about, including the fact that abortion coverage was not included as part of the required minimum benefits package. Crane said NARAL believes abortion should be treated like any other health service. But they think the Capps amendment at least maintains the status quo, and that it helped to alleviate many of the concerns expressed by abortion opponents. We thought they got everything they wanted, Crane said. We are confused why they continue to push. Obviously, there's a lot at stake in the health care bill for both sides in the abortion debate. The fact that several versions of the health care reform bill are floating around Congress makes it difficult to say with certainty what the final plan will or will not include. But while it appears likely the plan would allow for the coverage of abortions, we don't see anything in the plans that would require taxpayers to foot the bill for that. In fact, in a key version of the bill — the one passed by the House Energy and Commerce Committee — members went to great pains to include an amendment to ensure that federal money is not used for abortion coverage. Again, things could change as the health reform package works its way through Congress, but for now, we don't see anything to support Boehner's claim that taxpayers would subsidize abortions. And so we rule his statement False.",0,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,False

Final Rating: Half True  ","Says that in the last five years, Texas created more jobs than all other states combined.","The president of the conservative Texas Public Policy Foundation, Brooke Rollins, touts Texas economic strength in a TV ad that aired in April and May, saying that in the last five years, weve created more jobs than all other states combined. After a reader asked us to check Rollins claim, Joshua Trevino, a foundation spokesman, pointed us to information the foundation culled from the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics monthly employment data — specifically, figures from the Current Employment Statistics series, which is calculated using a broad survey of employer payroll data. First, the foundation identified those states where the number of jobs had grown between January 2006 and January 2011. There were only 10 states in that group. Texas ranked No. 1, with an increase of 545,900 jobs, from about 9.93 million to about 10.47 million. The other nine states, ranging in size from Louisiana to Wyoming, had a combined jobs increase of 183,700. However, that's not to say jobs werent lost in Texas during those years. Employment numbers fluctuate. At the states most recent peak, in August 2008, Texas had about 10.64 million jobs. About a year later, with the recession in full swing, Texas had about 400,000 less. Next, we asked the Texas Workforce Commission about the foundations claim. Lisa Givens, an agency spokeswoman, sent us a 50-state comparison of job growth also using monthly BLS figures. However, Givens accounting covered a more recent five-year period, March 2006 to March 2011 — numbers for which were still preliminary. Nine states, including Texas, had more jobs in March 2011 than in that month five years earlier. And Texas gains far outpaced the combined total for the other states: 539,500 vs. 134,400. So, the foundations figures stand up — in the way that such figures are often analyzed, including by PolitiFact. Unsaid is that this gauge defines job creation as a net increase in employment. That means the foundations analysis only takes into account the number of jobs created in excess of the number lost over a five-year period. But new jobs also sprung up in the other 40 states, although they were offset by greater losses. Is it fair to assess job creation without including them? Weve gone back and forth on that question. Rick Perry that Texas had created more than 850,000 jobs, more than all the other states combined. To come up with that number, Perrys campaign also looked at net job growth, although over a longer time period: January 2001 to June 2010. During our research of the Perry statement, Cheryl Abbot, a BLS economist in Dallas, told us that the governors statement was correct. We touched base with her again on the foundations TV statement, which she said has a legitimate basis.S. from November 2007-2008 were in Texas. We found that the Texas Workforce Commission, like the Texas Public Policy Foundation, had restricted its comparison to the states that experienced a net increase in employment; during the specified time period, there were 14 total, including Texas. While we researched that item, Michael Brandl, a senior lecturer at the University of Texas McCombs School of Business, told us that excluding all those states with net job losses — and disregarding any jobs gained in those states — exaggerates the Texas share of total new jobs in the U.S. To say it's misleading is to be kind, Brandi said. It's just not true. The Truth-O-Meter score so far: one ruling that favors net increases in employment as a valid gauge of job creation — and one that doesnt. Seeking more clarity, we turned to Jason Faberman, a senior economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia who has written an article on the BLS data sources. He agreed that it could be misleading to consider only net increases in jobs as job creation. But, he said, the public is accustomed to hearing it discussed that way. When most policy, political and media people refer to jobs created or added, they are referring to the net gain in employment over some period, Faberman said. Givens, at the workforce commission, told us that when the agency refers to net employment gains, it says jobs were added rather than created. What happens if you look at total jobs created, not just the net gain? Then Texas is no longer No. 1. The BLS keeps annual data, starting from April 1 each year, on total private sector job gains and losses. During the most recent three years — 2008, 2009 and 2010 — California gained an average of 1.3 million jobs annually, while Texas posted an average of 935,000 jobs. However, California also lost an average of 1.8 million jobs while Texas lost 992,000. However, Abbot cautioned that gross job numbers generally reflect a states population, meaning that big states would post bigger numbers than small ones. Theres no way that a Kansas could compare with a Texas, Abbot said. Faberman agreed that comparing gross job gains isnt the best way to fact-check the foundations statement. Instead, he suggested comparing Texas net employment change with that of the whole country, minus Texas share. What we found: In January 2011, the United States, excluding Texas, had 5.3 million fewer jobs than it did in January 2006 — the five-year period used by the foundation. That compares with the 545,900 increase that Texas experienced during that time. So, by Fabermans measure, Texas outperformed the rest of the country. We came across another way of thinking about job creation in an Aug. 24 blog on the Houston Chronicles website. According to the post, an unidentified economist noted that any raw job count would naturally favor Texas in a comparison with other net-gain states and asked what would happen if the size of the states job forces were factored in. The Chronicle did that by calculating the percentage increase in the states jobs between July 2009 and July 2010, and Texas still came out on top — but barely. Inspired by the Chronicle, we looked again at the 10 states with net job gains over the last five years. Texas gains represented a 5.5 percent increase in employment from January 2006 to January 2011. For the nine other states, their total increase of 183,700 jobs was a 2.5 percent increase. However, comparing the states individually, two had larger percentage increases than Texas: North Dakota (10.6 percent) and Alaska (5.7 percent). Another factor that changes — even reverses — the job creation numbers is the time frame. The longer the time frame, the better Texas numbers look. Comparing employment in a single month in 2006 with the same month five years later, Texas job numbers grow. Shorten the time period to three years, and Texas shows a net loss in jobs, going from 10.56 million jobs in January 2008 to 10.47 million in January 2011. So whats our (latest) ruling on job creation? The foundations claim that Texas created more jobs than all other states combined stands up — considering only those states that had net job gains over five years. Thats the methodology usually used to define job creation in public discourse. But the foundations analysis disregards the 40 states where millions of jobs were created but were outnumbered by losses. And looking at the percentage increase in jobs relative to the size of each states work force — another telling statistic — two other states experienced greater gains than Texas.",0.5,0.5,1,0.5,0,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,Half True

Final Rating: Half True  ",Says between 6 and 20 bicycles can be parked in the space required by one car.,"U.S. Rep. Earl Blumenauer has been associated with many causes during his 17 years in Congress. Bow ties come to mind, as does his support for protecting public lands. As founder and co-chair of the Congressional Bicycle Caucus, Blumenauer has been a leading voice in trying to establish the bicycle as a viable form of urban transportation. On the Bike and Pedestrian Issues page of his official website, he says that cycling improves health, is good for the environment and reduces transportation costs. One assertion in particular jumps out. It says, Between 6 and 20 bicycles can be parked in the space required by one car. PolitiFact Oregon wondered whether thats true. At first glance, the notion of up to 20 bicycles jammed into a single parking space seems a little much. To get an explanation, we called Blumenauers Washington, D.C., office and talked with spokesman Patrick Malone. Malone said the figure came from a paper published in 2011 by researcher Thomas Gotschi. Costs and Benefits of Bicycling Investments in Portland, Oregon was published in the Journal of Physical Activity & Health. A close reading does not reveal statistics addressing how many bicycles fit into a parking space. One section includes a sentence reading, The millions of miles traveled by bike reduce road and parking capacity demand, which is much more costly to provide for cars than for bikes. Its followed by a footnote, which took us to a second study, published this summer by the Victoria (B.C.) Transport Policy Institute. That 59-page study, written by Todd Litman, states, 10-20 bicycles can typically be stored in the space required for one automobile. Malone also referred to the bike corrals scattered around downtown Portland that hold 12 bicycles each, all in the amount of room needed to park a car. Then, noting two-tiered indoor bike parking available at Portland State University, he added, If you took the bike corrals we have now and put in double-decker parking with locks and lift assists, you could double that. Scott Cohen, the Portland Bureau of Transportations transportation demand management specialist, said Portland has 99 bike corrals. The portion that holds bicycles is 17 feet long and accommodates up to 12 bikes. A standard marked car-parking space is 20 feet long and about 10 feet wide. None of the corrals is the two-tier type mentioned by Malone. So 12 is the highest number of bicycle anyone will see in an area the size of a parking space. Two-tiered bike racks are available online but are primarily designed for commercial storage and retail bike storage and display. Several commercial racks hold as many as 20 bikes in 20 feet, but they need to be mounted to a wall or ceiling and arent really designed for outdoor use. Portland-based Alta Planning & Design, which has rolled out its Bicycle Share program in eight cities in the U.S. and abroad, says its racks fit about 10 bicycles in the length of a parking space. What if people simply stood their bikes next to one another or heaped them in a pile? Could 20 bikes fit inside a parking space then? Probably, but those options seem highly unlikely in the United States, and Malone didnt mention them. Twelve bicycles can be locked safely in downtown Portland bike corrals, but 20 stretches the limits of anything in use -- in Portland and nationwide. The Pedestrian and Bicycle Information Center says streetside bike corrals should accommodate 10 to 12 bikes. The Association of Pedestrian and Bicycle Professionals recommends spacing so that no more than 12 fit into a parking spot. As for the mechanical lifts available at PSU: Those wont be showing on city streets anytime soon. City policies allow only one-tier corrals, and businesses that already pay the city $2,600 to install one seem unlikely to want to pony up more. Blumenauers office does cite a study with a footnote leading to another study that says 10 to 20 bikes can fit into a single parking spot. The congressmans website also gives a range of 6 to 20 bikes, while 12 can commonly fit in corrals. So we find his statement Half True.",0.5,0.5,1.0,0.5,0.0,0.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,Half True

Final Rating: Half True  ","Says border fencing finished near El Paso in 2010 dramatically curtailed illegal crossings, local crime and drug smuggling.","Conservative Paul Sperry highlighted fencing erected near El Paso a decade ago as evidence that President Donald Trumps proposed border wall could enhance security. Sperry wrote in a January 2018 New York Post commentary that the fencing, described as completed in 2010, explains a dramatic decrease in violent crime in the West Texas city and plummets in illegal crossings and drug smuggling. We wondered about that after Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, promoted Sperrys commentary on Twitter and Bob Moore, former executive editor of the El Paso Times, asserted in his own tweet that El Paso had low violent crime rates as far back as 2005 while illegal border crossings, Moore wrote, decreased for varied reasons around 2010 including the Great Recession. Sperry, whom we emailed without hearing back, wrote that once the fencing went up, illegal crossings and levels of violent crime and drug smuggling rapidly subsided and that since then, El Paso has consistently topped rankings for cities of 500,000 residents or more with low crime rates, based on FBI-collected statistics. We'd suggest that claims about anycitys safety rankbe considered with caution. Such rankings are oft tied to FBI statistics that the agency counsels against using to rank or compare communities. Weve also done several separate fact-checks noting flaws in claims about El Pasos safety standing. On another front, it appears the fencing touted by Sperry was not finished in 2010. Ramiro Cordero, a spokesman for the Border Patrols El Paso sector, which takes in New Mexico, El Paso County and part of adjoining Hudspeth County, advised by email that from 2007 to approximately 2014, two types of fencing got built near the El Paso metro area: double-layered mesh 18 feet tall and mesh on movable barriers going up 22 feet. In 2009, David Aguilar of the Border Patrol specified at a U.S. Senate hearing that 626 miles of congressionally ordered fencing had been completed along the border. When fully built, Aguilar said, the additions would cover 661 miles from Texas into California, counting 115 miles each in New Mexico and Texas. Decreased illegal alien apprehensions We exploredeach part of Sperrys statement separately, starting with whether the new fencing greatly diminished border crossings. All along the southwestern border, its worth noting, apprehensions by the Border Patrol peaked in 2000 at 1.6 million (yearly total) and later generally declined starting around the time of the 2008-09 recession, Michelle Mittelstadt of the Migration Policy Institute, a nonpartisan think tank that studies worldwide immigration, has noted. Mittelstadt told PolitiFact in April 2017 that factors in Mexico had contributed to the drop-offs including lower birth rates, increased educational levels and an improved economy. In his commentary, Sperry wrote that according to Homeland Security data, the number of deportable illegal immigrants located by the U.S. Border Patrol plummeted by more than 89 percent over the five-year period during which the fencing between El Paso and neighboring Ciudad Juarez, Mexico, was completed. Sperry said that when the El Paso fencing project started in 2006, illegal crossings totaled 122,261, but by 2010, when the 131-mile fence was completed from one end of El Paso out into the New Mexico desert, immigrant crossings shrank to just 12,251. They hit a low of 9,678 in 2012, before slowly ticking back up to a total of 25,193 last year. But theyre still well below pre-fence levels, and the Border Patrol credits the fortified barrier dividing El Paso from Mexico for the reduction in illegal flows, Sperry wrote. We found that he accurately recapped government-posted tallies of illegal alien apprehensions, which are generally used as a metric to measure illegal immigration. An exception: When we checked, the Border Patrol was reporting a slightly greater number of apprehensions in 2006, 122,656 making the 9,678 apprehensions in the sector in 2012 92 percent less than apprehensions in 2006. Unaddressed by Sperry: All along the nations southern border, according to the Border Patrol, apprehensions decreased each year from 2007 through 2011. That is, the agencys pre-2017 low of 327,577 apprehensions in 2011 was down 69 percent from 1,071,972 apprehensions in 2006 and down 72 percent from 1,171,396 apprehensions in 2005. Border Patrol video singles out change in tactics Next, we reached out to the Border Patrol to ask about the fencing alone driving down apprehensions. We fielded no comment from Carlos A. Diaz, the agencys Southwest Border branch chief, though he pointed us by email to a 2017 Customs and Border Protection video describing enforcement actions from 1992 through 2016 to stem illegal crossings. The El Paso portion of the video doesnt mention fencing. Rather, it singles out the 285,000 apprehensions made in the El Paso sector in 1993--which a narrator says was the year that the Border Patrol implemented Operation Hold the Line at El Paso calling for the forward deployment of agents and technology to high-traffic areas. Focusing on prevention through deterrence, the narrator continues, the strategy proved successful and apprehensions decreased over 70 percent in the sector in one year and in 2015, 14,495 apprehensions were made in the El Paso sector. That snippet led us to revisit federal tallies of apprehensions, which show both a post-1986 high of 285,981 apprehensions in the sector in 1993 and a 72 percent plummet to 79,688 apprehensions in 1994 though apprehensions increased the next two years, reaching 145,929 in 1996. In subsequent years through September 2017, the sector reported decreased apprehensions in 13 years and increased apprehensions in eight years; its 25,193 apprehensions in 2017 amounted to the sectors third-most in a decade, possibly a reminder that economic conditions on both sides of the border, or unsafe conditions in parts of Central America, also can sway decisions to cross the Rio Grande. Other Border Patrol views When we asked, a couple of Border Patrol officers credited the El Paso fencing with enhancingenforcement. Doug Mosier, a Customs and Border Protection spokesman, said hes worked as an El Paso-based agency public affairs officer since 1986. By email, Mosier said Operation Hold The Line revolutionized the way that border security was conducted in terms of federal law enforcement prevention efforts. Mosier said Silvestre Reyes, later elected to the U.S. House, had tried a similar strategy on a smaller scale when he was a Border Patrol chief in McAllen, Texas, and it worked well for that community. According to a 2013 El Paso Times news story, the approach instigated by Reyes, described as still in place, called for the deployment of every available Border Patrol agent to different sites along 20 miles of the El Paso-Juarez border, roughly from Sunland Park, N.M., to the Zaragoza port of entry. Mosier elaborated to us: So, as the chief of El Paso Sector in 1993, he essentially positioned as many U.S. Border Patrol agents as he could spare (approximately 250 agents) along a primary 20-mile stretch of border separating El Paso/Juarez, over a three-week period. The result was astounding, since illegal apprehensions immediately dropped by approximately 80-percent overnight. Crime and loitering also fell by the wayside in the downtown district, which was later substantiated in several surveys and polls taken by the El Paso Times, and the then--El Paso Herald Post. At first the border community was in shock, but that soon gave way to widespread support which manifested in improved living conditions for residents in El Paso, and in some areas of N.M. The Times story said that after Hold the Line was implemented, Reyes went on to urge more strategic fencing. Mosier, asked to assess the effects of the fencing, said that when primary pedestrian fencing (18-feet) was implemented in 2008, it provided effective infrastructure in much-needed areas of the border. It also improved USBP effectiveness by better directing illegal immigration into areas where Border Patrol had more resources to monitor traffic via technology, aircraft, combined with increased agent personnel. We said at that time, and still say today, that those combined resources, our strong working relationship with law enforcement partners, and the support by residents in El Paso were essential to the success of El Paso border security efforts, Mosier said. Cordero, who also told us hes worked for the agency in the sector for 18 years, agreed the fencing helped reduce apprehensions but, he said, other enforcement activities and cooperation between law agencies and with Mexican authorities also mattered. Victor Manjarrez Jr. of the University of Texas at El Paso told us he was the sector chief when the fencing went up. By email, Manjarrez deemed the fencing a factor in driving down apprehensions along with increased Border Patrol personnel, expanded technology and infrastructure including lights and roads. Although the pedestrian wall had a huge impact, Manjarrez said, so did the increase in Border Patrol agents driven by a 2004 congressional directive to beef up the agency. I would disagree that the wall was the sole reason for the decline in criminal activity, but it was a MAJOR factor in improving the quality of life. El Paso crime Sperry wrote that FBI crime-rate information shows the fencing drove down crime in El Paso. In fact, Sperry wrote, El Paso before 2010 was mired in violent crime and drug smuggling, thanks in large part to illicit activities spilling over from the Mexican side. Once the fence went up, however, things changed almost overnight. His commentary also said: According to FBI tables, property crimes in El Paso have plunged more than 37 percent to 12,357 from their pre-fence peak of 19,702 a year, while violent crimes have dropped more than 6 percent to 2,682 from a peak of 2,861 a year. Moore countered in a post-publication tweet that El Pasos violent crime rate was on the slide long before the fencing got built. Our search of the Nexis news database showed too that the El Paso County sheriff, Richard Wiles, told a U.S. Senate committee in 2009 that by that year, El Paso had been considered one of the countrys safest cities for a dozen years, long before the new fence was built, Wiles testified. Moore, answering our request for more information, emailed us his spreadsheet suggesting that each year from 2000 through 2016, El Pasos violent crime rate based on FBI data far trailed the average violent crime rate for like cities of 500,000 to 1 million residents. The FBIs posted figures enabled us to confirm that El Pasos violent crime rate trailed the national average for cities of 500,000 to 1 million residents from 1985 through 2016. The citys rate also mostly decreased year to year, the figures indicate, though the city still saw 11 year-to-year increases with the biggest rate bump, 10 percent, occurring in 2008. Conversely, El Pasos rate sank 10 percent or more 10 times in the 30 years including 1994, 1995, 1998, 2000, 2002, 2003, 2005 and 2006--all before the new fencing was mandated or fully installed--with the other big drops occurring in 1987 and 2013. Drug smuggling Sperry wrote that drug smuggling at the El Paso border entry point has also fallen dramatically. In fact, since the fence was completed, the volume of marijuana and cocaine coming through El Paso and seized by Border Patrol agents has been cut in half. The year before the wall was fully built in 2010, Sperry went on, the volume of illegal drugs confiscated by the feds along the El Paso border hit 87,725 pounds. The year after, the amount of drug seizures plummeted to 43,783 pounds. Last year, they dropped even further to a total of 34,329, according to Border Patrol reports obtained by The Post. We found slightly different figures. Regardless, a chart provided by Cordero showed that the dollar amount of illegal drug seizures in the El Paso sector substantially declined from 2007 through 2014, when the agencys $35.2 million in seizures was more than 400 percent less than the nearly $151 million in seizures in 2006. While seizures escalated in 2015 and 2016, reaching $54 million, they declined to $39 million in 2017, the agencys chart says. Drug Seizures, El Paso Sector, U.S. Border Patrol, Fiscal 2006 though Fiscal 2017         SOURCE: Email, Ramiro Cordero, agent, U.S, Border Patrol, El Paso sector, Jan. 18, 2018 We later ran these mostly reduced interdictions of illegal drugs past Sanho Tree, director of the Drug Policy Project at the Institute for Policy Studies, which calls itself Washingtons first progressive multi-issue think tank. Tree said by phone he wasnt aware of research on the effect of the El Paso fencing on drug smuggling. Yet generally, Tree said, declines in captured drugs dont necessarily signal fall-offs in smuggling, which relies on frequent shifts in methodology extending to drones, tunnels, even catapults. What you interdict shows you what youre catching, it doesnt show what youre not catching, Tree said, adding that its hard to model the effects on smuggling of particular law enforcement tacks. Local police agencies didnt engage withthis fact-check. Sgt. Enrique Carrillo of the El Paso Police Department replied by email: We are not commenting on this. Our requests to interview Sheriff Wiles went unfulfilled. Our ruling Sperry wrote that the fencing finished near El Paso in 2010 dramatically curtailed illegal crossings, local crime and drug smuggling. Such crossings evidently plunged after the fencing was built (though they later rebounded a bit) and it could be that drug smuggling fell off as well. Yet this claim fails to account for El Paso's violent crime rate trending down long before the fencing went up nor does it acknowledge other factors affecting security including apre-1995 shift in enforcement strategy and stepped-up Border Patrol staffing.

Final Rating: Half True  ",Says Rick Scott cut Medicaid so people can't get Obamacare.,"It starts like a joke — Gov. Rick Scott walks into a Gainesville Starbucks — but one patron wasnt laughing. In town on April 5, 2016, to tour the recently opened factory and headquarters for biopharmaceutical company Nanotherapeutics, Scott stopped in to the coffee chain for a cup. Cara Jennings, a former Lake Worth city commissioner, saw Scott and ripped into him from her seat. Among other grievances, she accused him of denying her health care coverage with his policies. In fact, you cut Medicaid so I couldnt get Obamacare, Jennings shouted on April 5, 2016. You are an a------! You dont care about working people. You dont care about working people. You should be ashamed to show your face around here. When Scott countered that the state had created a million jobs since the recession, she said no one cared (read our fact-check on those jobs numbers). She then criticized his March signing of a bill denying funding for womens health care clinics that performed abortions (read our check about that issue). We tried to reach Jennings by phone, text, email and even Facebook, but we didnt hear back from her, so we dont really know the specifics of her situation. That makes it difficult to gauge whether she was able to benefit from the health care law. But we can look at whether Scott cut Medicaid, the joint state and federal program to provide health insurance for the very poor, in a way that could have denied people health coverage under the Affordable Care Act. Its not so much that he cut anything, but more that he hasnt consistently supported expanding the program. That has indeed left hundreds of thousands of Floridians without coverage. The expansion debate  Jennings told ABC Action News in Tampa after the incident that she is a single mother who worked part-time. That provides clues that she may fall into what is known as the Medicaid coverage gap. To understand why, lets review how the Affordable Care Act is linked to Medicaid. The law originally wanted to cover uninsured people two different ways. One was to subsidize people who needed help buying insurance through state marketplaces or HealthCare.gov. The second was to expand Medicaid to cover a higher number of poorer people. Normally, to be eligible for Medicaid, your annual income has to be 44 percent of the federal poverty level (100 percent is currently $11,880 for an individual and $24,300 for a family of four). The plan was to extend that eligibility to all adults up to 138 percent of the poverty level. Technically the calculation under the law is 133 percent, but a 5 percent deduction is added on top of that. But Medicaid expansion ended up being optional after a 2012 Supreme Court ruling saying it could not be forced upon states. Currently 19 states, including Florida, have chosen not to grow the program. Recent estimates from the Kaiser Family Foundation showed that 948,000 uninsured adults in Florida would be covered by an expansion. This has led to plenty of debate among lawmakers, including a meltdown during the 2015 Florida legislative session over how to cover more lower-income residents. The Senate was open to a limited expansion, while the House opposed it altogether. But now the math really starts to get tricky. If a state doesnt expand Medicaid, people who make 100 to 400 percent of the poverty level can get marketplace subsidies to buy private insurance. Because of the way the law was written, that leaves people making between 44 and 100 percent of the poverty level out in the cold, without assistance. Those people dont qualify for Medicaid, and cant get subsidies to buy insurance. Thats the so-called coverage gap. According to Kaiser, there are 567,000 people under that umbrella in the Sunshine State. Chances are good that a single mother working part time could fit into that definition. Scott, a former hospital chain executive best known for resigning amid controversy over his company defrauding Medicare, has had a spotty history with Medicaid. He initially opposed expanding the program under Obamacare, then supported it during his re-election campaign, then went back to opposing it. While the Legislature is the body that would have to approve an expansion, Scotts opinion affects the debate. (Scotts office did not respond to our questions about Medicaid.) He has argued with Washington over the federal government ending payments for low-income hospital patients, leaving the Legislature to use state money to plug holes in the program the last two years. Scott has also asked lawmakers to eliminate automatic increases to Medicaid hospital rates. Hes also overseen the states controversial transition to managed care, in which private companies took over Medicaid policies as a cost-cutting measure. Florida CHAIN, a consumer health advocacy group, told us managed care organizations had actually seen a boost in funding. And theres the aforementioned abortion bill Scott signed on March 25. That bill prevents state and Medicaid money from going to clinics that perform elective abortions, including Planned Parenthood affiliates. But these are specific issues not necessarily related to getting access to broad health care coverage under Obamacare. While many Floridians remain uninsured without Medicaid expansion, we found no evidence of an outright cut, as Jennings said. Our ruling The activist at Starbucks said Rick Scott cut Medicaid so people can't get Obamacare. Her point-blank accusation that Scott cut the program doesnt fit. But through Scotts inaction and the Florida House's resistance to expansion,many Floridians are not benefitting from either subsidies to buy private insurance or an expanded Medicaid.

Final Rating: Half True  ","When I was governor, not only did test scores improve – we also narrowed the achievement gap.","Mitt Romney heard both cheers and boos during his speech to the 2012 NAACP convention, where he vowed to help hundreds of millions of middle-class Americans of all races.While acknowledging the unlikelihood of a Republican addressing the group in the midst of a race against an African-American president, Romney nonetheless declared that he is the best candidate to help black Americans.The former Massachusetts governor touted his own record on several topics, including education. He said he intervened in failing schools, promoted math and science and strengthened testing standards.When I was governor, not only did test scores improve – we also narrowed the achievement gap, Romney, who served from 2003 to 2007, said.Romneys education record in Massachusetts is uncharted territory at PolitiFact, so we decided to check it out.A little on Massachusetts schoolsWe talked to several people knowledgeable about the school system in the Bay State, and all mentioned a 1993 landmark reform law that included the groundwork for the state accountability system (later called Massachusetts Comprehensive Assessment System, or MCAS), authorized charter schools and invested more money in local school districts. Its universal goal was to raise educational standards for all Massachusetts kids.Romney also referenced the reform in his speech to the NAACP on July 11, 2012:In the years before I took office our states leaders had come together to pass bipartisan measures that were making a difference. In reading and in math, our students were already among the best in the nation – and during my term, they took over the top spot. Those results revealed what good teachers can do if the system will only let them. The problem was, this success wasnt shared. A significant achievement gap between students of different races remained. So we set out to close it.This was all happening in a place where student achievement regularly leads the pack. Massachusetts, which has a disproportionately high number of colleges and universities, some of the nations wealthiest ZIP codes and a well-educated workforce, churns out many high performing students.But the glare of those top achievers makes the shadow of struggling students that much darker. That is to say, Massachusetts still has a significant achievement gap. The term refers to the disparity in performance between certain subsets of students. White, middle- and upper-class kids consistently do better in school than African-American and latino and low-income kids in the U.S.And in Massachusetts, because the kids at the top do so well, its that much harder for everybody else to catch up.Our scores are high, so as they get higher its pretty hard to move up, said Kathleen Skinner, a policy director at the Massachusetts Teachers Association, a teachers union.Narrowing the gapAs backup for the claim in Romneys speech, his campaign sent us a 2007 MCAS test results summary, and specifically pointed to 10th grade scores:10th Grade Proficiency In Matho 2005, White: 29%; Black: 19%. Gap = 10 pointso 2007, White: 29%; Black: 26%. Gap = 3 points10th Grade Proficiency In Englisho 2005, White: 46%; Black: 30%. Gap = 16 pointso 2007, White: 52%; Black: 40%. Gap = 12 pointsThat shows the achievement gap narrowing by 7 percentage points in math and by 4 percentage points in English.But the gains in other grades are smaller.Among eighth-graders, the gap tightened by only 1 point in math and 2 points in English. For seventh-graders, the change was 3 points in math, 5 points in English. Sixth grade: 1 point in math, no change in English. In fourth grade scores, the gap narrowed by 1 point in math and widened by 1 point in English. (Some of those are comparisons between 2006 scores and 2007, the only years provided in the test results summary.)Skinner pointed out an important point about the MCAS: 10th-graders have to pass it in order to graduate.They start paying attention, she said. We also took a look at scores for the following year, comparing the achievement gap between 2007 and 2008. (These charts offer a slightly different comparison from the previous year, which looked at students who scored proficient on each test. The 2007-08 chart includes those scoring proficient and higher.) The best gains again were made by 10th graders who narrowed the gap by six points in English. But there was no change in the gap in math scores, and lower grades showed only one- or two-point gains, or no improvement at all, and the gap widened in a couple of instances, such as eighth-grade science scores. The 2008-2009 test score summary reflected a similar trend: small gains in some subjects and small setbacks in others.Beverly Miyares, also with the Massachusetts Teachers Association, added that the dropout rate among black students in Massachusetts increased from 2002 to 2004, rising from 4.9 to 6.3.That means more under-performing students who dropped out of school didnt drag down the overall average test scores.Romneys roleIn claims such as this, we dont just consider the accuracy but also whether the speaker deserves credit: How responsible was Romney for narrowing the achievement gap?The most important point to make with Gov. Romneys record is that the reform he initiated was part of a much larger and longer movement that existed in Massachusetts, said Chad d'Entremont, executive director of the Rennie Center, which provides independent, nonpartisan research to inform public education reform in Massachusetts.Glenn Koocher, executive director with the Massachusetts Association of School Committees, which represents school boards, was less generous: He had nothing to do with it. Its the teachers in the classrooms who are making the difference.Skinner, the expert with the teachers union, added that Romney was a somewhat absent education governor. He was very agenda driven.We would argue that he didnt put anything in place to narrow the gap, she said.We also wondered whether Romney had pushed any initiatives specifically aimed at helping minority students. Koocher and Skinner both mentioned charter schools, which are favored by many Republicans.The charter school program was always popular among minority parents (and) any parents that wanted to get their kids out of the public schools, Koocher said, adding that vouchers commonly used to pay tuition at charter schools are unconstitutional in Massachusetts. Instead, the per-pupil state spending is deducted from the public school districts budget.Ryan Williams, spokesman for the Romney campaign, said protecting the 1993 reform legislation was an important effort by Romney. He said there were attempts to repeal the graduation requirement, and Romney stood firm on that and did not back down.It was one of the bigger things we had success in blocking, Williams said. A lot of what Romney did when he was governor was to preserve that legislation. He said, Im not going to roll these standards back. Skinner mentioned another, perhaps less obvious, initiative from Romney that helped many minority students: universal health care. Romney signed a health care reform law in Massachusetts that led to a 98 percent coverage rate.In Massachusetts, all of our kids have health insurance, and I dont think anybody should underestimate the impact that has on learning. Our kids get vaccinated, they can go to the dentist, they can go to the eye doctor, she said. Their health is less of an issue than it is in other places.Our rulingRomney told the NAACP that when he was governor of Massachusetts, not only did test scores improve – we also narrowed the achievement gap.State education figures over two years support Romneys claim about learning gains, although its worth noting that some areas declined on his watch, such as the drop-out rate. And its always somewhat dubious to take a snapshot of statistics from only one or two years, when, as d'Entremont said significant gains in student achievement dont happen overnight, and the gains in Massachusetts are the result of a 20-year reform effort.Whats more, Romney, a single-term governor, should not get all the credit for improvement in the achievement gap, which is influenced by myriad factors.His statement is partially accurate but omits a lot of important information and overstates his impact.",0.5,0.5,1,0.5,0,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,Half True

Final Rating: Half True  ",You have areas of Pennsylvania that are barely affected and [the governor wants] to keep them closed.,"After touring an Allentown warehouse filled with protective medical equipment, President Donald Trump criticized Gov. Tom Wolf for keeping parts of Pennsylvania closed that the president thinks are no longer threatened by the coronavirus. You have areas of Pennsylvania that are barely affected and [the governor wants] to keep them closed, Trump told a crowd of workers from Owens & Minor, a company that manufactures and distributes masks, gloves and gowns to health care workers, on May 14. We wondered whether the statewide stay-at-home order Wolf issued on April 1 still applies to places hardly impacted by the deadly disease. It all depends what criteria are used to determine whether the coronavirus still poses a threat. The virus is still raging across Southeastern Pennsylvania, and not even Trump is arguing that Philadelphia and its suburbs are ready to reopen. Officials in Delaware and Bucks counties, however, have asked Wolf to exclude their nursing-home populations when he eventually rates their readiness. Largely when you look across the state, the hardest hit area has been the Southeast of Pennsylvania, said Dr. David Rubin, director of PolicyLab at Childrens Hospital of Philadelphia, which has been tracking the differences in the outbreak across individual regions of the country. The Philadelphia area as far west as Lancaster, Berks and Dauphin counties, and north to the Lehigh Valley have seen some of the worst outbreaks in Pennsylvania, he said. Largely the rest of the state has had a pretty deceptively, sort of minimal experience with COVID, Rubin said. That includes Allegheny County, the rural T and the South, Central and Southwestern parts of the state. When you have someone in that area of the state that are upset that they are unable to work, theyre not wrong, Rubin said. But for those in the Southeast worried about a resurgence, theyre not wrong, either. Wolf has already moved 37 Pennsylvania counties into what he calls the yellow phase of reopening. In these places, many businesses may resume in-person operations, and residents may leave their homes so long as they take precautions. Thirteen counties in Southwestern Pennsylvania moved into the yellow phase May 15. Twenty-four others in the Northern half of the state entered yellow May 8. Another 12 counties will move into yellow on May 22. Counties in the red phase of Wolfs reopening plan are still under lockdown, with stay-at-home orders in place and all but essential businesses closed. Counties that eventually make it to the green phase will ask businesses and individuals to follow Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and State Department of Health guidelines for limiting the spread of the virus but will otherwise have no restrictions. Yellow counties gyms, hair salons, and schools must remain closed, and gatherings of more than 25 people are prohibited. Even still, yellow is the distinction several other Central and Eastern Pennsylvania counties are clamoring for. A key factor that determines whether a county qualifies for yellow privileges is whether it has fewer than 50 new reported coronavirus cases per 100,000 residents over a period of 14 days. The number of people sickened with the virus in Lancaster, Lebanon, Dauphin, Franklin and Schuylkill counties disqualifies them from entering the yellow phase. But that fact didnt stop local leaders from announcing plans to reopen businesses anyway – with or without Wolfs blessing. In a series of letters and tweets, the officials, including state lawmakers and county commissioners, begged Wolf to allow local businesses to reopen and better position themselves to survive the crisis. Officials from Dauphin, Franklin and Schuylkill counties later backed down. Lebanon officials are set to vote on reopening today. Lancaster officials held a news conference on the issue Thursday night but did not say what they will do. Counties reversed course after Wolf called them cowardly and selfish and threatened to withhold their federal stimulus funds if they directed businesses and residents to defy his order. Until recently, another nine counties found themselves in limbo. They had reported fewer than 50 cases per 100,000 residents over a 14-day period, but until May 15, when Wolf announced plans to move them into the yellow phase soon, they remained stuck in the red zone, which requires businesses to stay closed and residents to continue sheltering at home. Those counties include: York, Adams, Perry, Juniata, Mifflin, Carbon, Wyoming, Susquehanna and Wayne. Officials from York and Adams counties had been especially vocal about their frustration that businesses had not been cleared to reopen. Some officials said they didnt understand what was holding them back, given their success keeping coronavirus case counts relatively low. Wolf had been asked about the discrepancy several times in recent days before he announced plans to move the counties into yellow by May 22, and his explanations lacked clarity. We had to read a 7,000 word Wolf administration document titled Process to Reopen Pennsylvania to figure it out. A countys coronavirus case count is not the only piece of information Wolfs team uses to determine when its ready to move into the yellow phase. Hes said this publicly, but on recent calls with the press, he hasnt listed the other factors that matter. Carnegie Mellon University researchers advising the state compiled the list and rated counties in each category. According to the document, the other factors are: A countys ability to meet a surge in demand for intensive care. A countys density. The share of county residents who are over age 60. The share of county residents who work in physically closed industry sectors, such as nursing homes. When those pieces are considered, it appears York County was held back from reopening because of its population density, and Adams County was ordered to stay closed because it has an insufficient number of intensive care unit beds. Mifflin, Juniata, Perry, Carbon, Susquehanna and Wayne counties were also flagged because of limited ICU capacity. We had to click through a link tucked at the bottom of a May 8 press release to find a May 7 PowerPoint presentation detailing how each Pennsylvania county rates on the Carnegie Mellon risk assessment scale. Its unclear if county officials calling to have their stay-at-home orders lifted know where to find their own ratings. Wyoming County in the Northeast corner of the state has a small number of coronavirus cases and doesnt rate as high risk in any of the other categories. Before Wolf announced that Wyoming County would move into the yellow phase by May 22, it was unclear why Wolf wouldnt allow businesses there to reopen. County officials had announced plans to reopen without Wolfs approval and later backed down. In the Process to Reopen Pennsylvania document, the state cautioned that the reopening process will be fluid and that the Carnegie Mellon rating system is not designed to make decisions but rather to inform decision makers. Trump said that Wolf wants to keep parts of Pennsylvania closed that have been barely affected by the coronavirus. Trump was likely speaking about counties in Central and Eastern Pennsylvania like Lebanon and Lancaster whose Republican lawmakers have been clamoring for more freedom even though their coronavirus case counts remain relatively high. Those places have not been barely affected. Theyre battling active outbreaks. Trump was right, though, that until May 15, Wolf wanted to keep closed nine counties with relatively few cases.",0.5,0.5,1,0.5,0,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,Half True

Final Rating: Half True  ",Says 92 percent of the people agree on DACA.,"President Donald Trump has questioned why undocumented immigrants who came to the United States as children should be deported, a sharp departure from the campaign when he advocated for the removal of all who were violating immigration laws. Trumps administration is phasing out Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA), an Obama-era program that shields young undocumented immigrants from deportation. At the same time, Trump wants Congress to pass a permanent solution for the so-called Dreamers, saying the idea has very high support among Americans. (DACA recipients are commonly called Dreamers.) Look, 92 percent of the people agree on DACA, but what we want is we want very, very powerful border security, Trump said Sept. 14 before traveling from Washington to meet with Floridians affected by Hurricane Irma. He said Republican congressional leaders were also on board. Later in Florida, he said they were not looking at amnesty or citizenship, but looking at allowing people to stay here. If and when funding for Trumps border wall will come or what will be part of a DACA deal is still unclear. For now, we were curious about Trumps claim that 92 percent of people agree on a solution for DACA recipients. We did not find a poll showing support that high, but several polls do show that the majority of Americans want a favorable outcome for Dreamers. The White House declined to comment for this fact-check. We found several polls that asked about DACA and showed majority support for not deporting Dreamers. But we did not find nearly universal support that Trump described. • A Morning Consult and Politico poll conducted between Sept. 7-11, after the Trump administration announced it was eliminating DACA, found that of 1,976 registered voters polled, 45 percent said it was the wrong thing to do; 35 percent said it was the right thing to do; 20 percent did not know or had no opinion. Asked about the issue in a different way — When it comes to legislation regarding Dreamers, which of the following would you most like Congress to pass? — 54 percent of respondents said they would want legislation that allowed Dreamers to stay and become citizens if they met certain requirements; 19 percent favored legislation that would allow them to stay legally but not become citizens, if they met certain requirements; 12 percent wanted legislation that removes or deports them; and 15 percent did not know or had no opinion. So, for this second question, 73 percent favored legislation that would protect Dreamers from deportation. A previous Morning Consult and Politico poll, conducted from April 20-24 asked about 2,000 registered voters what they thought was the best way to handle Dreamers. Fifty-six percent said they should be allowed to stay and become citizens if they met certain requirements, and 22 percent favored allowing them to stay and become legal residents, but not citizens, if they met certain requirements. Overall, 78 percent definitely did not want Dreamers to be deported. • An NBC News and SurveyMonkey poll, conducted online from August 24-29 among a national sample of 10,129 adults, found 64 percent support for DACA. • A Sept. 3-5 poll from The Economist and YouGov of 1,500 U.S. adults also found that 55 percent of responders somewhat or strongly supported DACA, though support for the program was lower among Trump voters and Republicans. Several polling and public opinion experts we reached out to say they were not aware of any recent poll showing a 92 percent support for DACA, but that a solid majority does seem to favor the program. Trump said92 percent of the people agree on DACA. We found several polls in which a majority of people said they supported DACA or favored legislation that would allow Dreamers to stay in the United States. But the level of support was not as high as 92 percent.",0.5,0.5,1,0.5,0,0.2,0.4,1,0.6,Half True

Final Rating: Half True  ",Wisconsin children are crossing condemned bridges in the middle of the winter to get to the school bus.,"Saying Wisconsins transportation needs are urgent, state Sen. Kathleen Vinehout, a potential candidate for governor in 2018, made an alarming claim. We have bridges in my own county that have been condemned, the Alma Democrat said Feb. 24, 2017 on Wisconsin Public Television. And we still have school children that are crossing those condemned bridges in the middle of the winter to get to the school bus. An unsettling image for rural Buffalo County, which is three hours northwest of Madison. We found there are two bridges in the county so badly damaged that they are closed to vehicle traffic, though only one of them is traversed by children to get to and from their school bus. And the word condemned, while accurate in a colloquial sense, exaggerates the danger to kids. Bridge worries The need for improvements on Wisconsins bridges has gained attention in the past couple of years, even if the terms used to describe their condition might mean less than they seem. Structurally deficient means suffering from deterioration to at least one major component, but not unsafe. Functionally obsolete means built using outdated standards, such as older design features. Wisconsins figure has risen to 15 percent, according to a 2017 report by the American Road & Transportation Builders Association, with 1,232 bridges deficient and 783 obsolete. How to pay for bridge work has been a persistent issue. A January 2017 audit by the nonpartisan state Legislative Audit Bureau noted that in a 2015 survey done by the bureau, only 50 percent of county highway commissioners said money for routine maintenance on bridges was adequate. Meanwhile, Republican Gov. Scott Walker and the GOP-majority Legislature, as they work on Walkers state budget proposal for 2017-19, are debating about new taxes or other ways of funding road and bridge work. Buffalo County To check Vinehouts claim, we called Buffalo County Highway Commissioner Bob Platteter. He said flooding caused by an August 2016 storm damaged the 125-foot Schoepps Valley Bridge, which spans Waumandee Creek, beyond repair. Its scrap, he said. The bridge was closed to vehicle traffic, so in that sense it could be considered condemned, Platteter told us -- but it was judged safe for pedestrian crossing, which continued until demolition began nearly seven months later, in March 2017. Nearby residents would drive their children to the bridge and the kids walked over it to catch the school bus, he said. And to avoid a detour of up to 20 miles, some residents with multiple vehicles parked one on the road on one side of the bridge and one on the other side. Platteter said a new timber bridge is expected to be installed by the end of April 2017. The Highway U bridge in Buffalo County partially collapsed one evening in February 2017, causing accidents two accidents that injured both drivers, though neither needed treatment.The collapse likely was also because of flood damage, Platterer said. That bridge is also now open only to pedestrians. But school buses use other county roads to pick up and drop off children in that area, he said. Our rating Vinehout says Wisconsin children are crossing condemned bridges in the middle of the winter to get to the school bus. Two bridges in Vinehouts home county of Buffalo have been condemned in that they are too badly damaged for any vehicle traffic. But officials have determined that they remain safe for pedestrians, and children do use one of the bridges to get to and from their school bus.

Final Rating: Half True  ","In Texas, we've had three ISIS-related incidents already.","After the recent terrorist attacks in France, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott was among governors declaring they would not accept Syrian refugees because of a potential for terrorism. Abbott appeared on The Real Story, a Fox News program, on Nov.17, 2015, to explain his stance on keeping refugees out of Texas because of security concerns. We've had three ISIS-related incidents already and now with the possible connection of one of the Syrian refugees being involved in the terrorist attack in Paris, Abbott said, Texas is saying 'no more.  We wondered whether Texas was really the site of so many ISIS plots. Abbott spokesman John Wittman pointed us to a letter from Abbott to Obama dated Nov. 16, 2015, which said: The threat posed to Texas by ISIS is very real. ISIS claimed credit last May when two terrorist gunmen launched an attack in Garland, Texas. Less than two weeks later, the FBI arrested an Iraqi-born man in North Texas and charged him with lying to federal agents about traveling to Syria to fight with ISIS. The letter went on to say that in 2014, when I served as Texas attorney general, we participated in a Joint Terrorism Task Force that arrested two Austin residents for providing material support to terrorists -- including ISIS. To determine if Abbott got his facts straight, we looked at each of the incidents. An Austin-area arrest and conviction Some of this was old ground for us. In September 2014, when Abbott was the state attorney general also running for governor, he claimed hed been involved in prosecuting a terrorist member of ISIS. We found that claim False; Abbott offered no evidence to back up his declaration aside from a press release crediting a range of agencies including the attorney general as well as the Killeen Police Department and Texas Alcoholic Beverage Commission. Abbotts statement also relied on a broad definition of terrorist and ISIS member. A federal complaint indicated Michael Todd Wolfe of Austin may have sought to be those things. But the complaint didnt confirm hed become a terrorist or ISIS member. In the case in question, Wolfe and Rahatul Khan of Round Rock, Texas, were charged with attempting to provide material support to terrorists. Wolfe had tried to board an international flight out of George Bush Intercontinental Airport that would take him to the first stop on a planned journey to Syria. In June 2015, Wolfe was sentenced to seven years in prison for attempting to provide material support to terrorists. According to the criminal complaint, Khan attempted to recruit an undercover FBI agent to a terrorist cell over the Internet. He was sentenced to 10 years imprisonment. The pipeline was affiliated with al-Shabaab — the al-Qaeda-linked Somali militant group behind the mass slaying of Christian students at a Kenyan university earlier this year—not ISIS. Abbotts second described incident In his 2015 letter to Obama, Abbott also referenced concerns about Bilal Abood, the Iraqi-born man in North Texas. Court documents show Abood migrated to the United States in 2009, and offer the following account of his subsequent movement and activities: On March 29, 2013, FBI agents prevented Abood from boarding a flight at Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport. He told them he was planning to visit family. Interviewed a second time five days later, Abood said his intent was to join the Free Syrian Army (FSA) in the struggle against Bashar al-Assad, the president of Syria. Later in April 2013, Abood travelled to Turkey via Mexico, on or about April 29. Agents again interviewed Abood upon his return to the United States on Sept. 16, 2013. He admitted he had travelled to Syria and stayed in an FSA camp, but denied financially supporting any terrorist group. A search of Aboods computer in July 2014 found that he had tweeted a pledge of allegiance to Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the leader of ISIS, on June 19, 2014. He later denied pledging allegiance to ISIS and was arrested for making a materially false, fictitious and fraudulent statement and representation, in a matter within the jurisdiction of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Abbotts letter mischaracterizes the nature of Aboods offense; he wrote that Abood was charged with lying to federal agents about traveling to Syria to fight with ISIS, not lying about a tweet. Shootings in Garland The third incident referenced by Abbott was the Garland, Texas, shooting scheme attempted by Elton Simpson and Nadir Soofi on May 5, 2015. According to a criminal complaint the FBI later filed against a Florida man who claimed to have encouraged the attack, the two planned to shoot attendees at a contest centered around cartoons of the prophet Muhammad (drawing the prophet Muhammad is forbidden in Islam). However, they were shot and killed outside the event by police. This incident is the only foiled attack included in a Department Homeland Security analysis of all ISIS-related arrests on United States soil from January 2014 to September 2015 (the other cases were unsuccessful and successful attempts to travel to fight with ISIS, provide material support to ISIS, and engage in early stage aspirational attack planning). In the aftermath of the shooting, ISIS claimed credit. However, by the time Abbott made his claim, investigators had yet to issue any statement characterizing the Garland attack as having been ordered by members of ISIS. Simpson was involved in terrorist causes before ISIS even split off from Al-Qaeda.

Final Rating: Half True  ","U.S. Sen. Johnny Isakson has never proposed, nor voted in favor of, a substantial cut in federal spending and has voted for many substantial increases in federal spending.","Note to readers: a letter to the editor responding to this item appeared Oct. 11, 2010. The letter appears at the end of the article. Chuck Donovan gave us a challenge.The Libertarian nominee for Georgia's U.S. Senate seat asked AJC PolitiFact Georgia to check out some claims on his campaign website about the incumbent, Sen. Johnny Isakson, R-Ga. Voters will decide among Isakson, Donovan and Democrat Michael Thurmond on Nov. 2.We looked at Donovan's blog, which included a post called Isakson's Inconsistencies. The post challenged the Republican on a host of issues, but one line questioning Isakson's conservative credentials on federal spending stood out.Mr. Isakson has never proposed, nor voted in favor of, a substantial cut in federal spending, Donovan began. However, he has voted in favor of: (a) many substantial increases in federal spending; and (b) tremendous annual deficits.Challenge accepted.Isakson spokeswoman Sheridan Watson showed us a page on the senator's website full of news releases and statements highlighting votes and bills he supported to curb spending. It also noted Isakson has twice won the Taxpayers' Friend Award from the National Taxpayers Union for his efforts to curb federal spending.Happy investigating, Watson wrote us.Donovan's post was researched and written by fellow Libertarian Allen Buckley, an Atlanta-based attorney and certified public accountant who won 2 percent of the vote in an unsuccessful campaign against Isakson in 2004.Let's look at the first part of Donovan's claim: Isakson has never proposed or voted for a substantial cut in federal spending.The senator's website offers four main arguments to dispute Donovan. Isakson has voted often to cap discretionary spending, programs that are not entitlements such as Medicare and Social Security. Discretionary spending, which includes the Defense Department budget, has amounted to about as much as 40 percent of the total federal budget in recent years. Second, the senator has been a big proponent of biennial budgeting, preparing and adopting budgets for two-year periods. The federal budget is currently adopted on an annual basis. Biennial budgeting proponents argue the idea would allow the federal government to adopt two budgets in one year and spend the second year taking more time to improve how government works. Others, including the Congressional Budget Office, have warned biennial budgeting could backfire if the revenue streams are uncertain, which makes it difficult to budget accurately.Third, Isakson supports the Pay It Back Act, which would require that money repaid by banks and other businesses who received taxpayer dollars from the Troubled Assets Relief Program (TARP) be used toward deficit reduction.The fourth idea is legislation introduced in 2006 and 2007 by U.S. Sen. Judd Gregg, R-N.H., called Stop Over-Spending. Isakson co-sponsored the bill. SOS aimed to reduce the federal deficit and essentially balance the budget by 2012 through slowing the rate of growth for entitlement programs, except for Social Security, if Congress doesn't meet deficit reduction targets. It also gave the president a line-item veto. The Senate never voted on the bill.The SOS bill received positive reviews from the conservative organizations National Review and the Heritage Foundation, saying it would have forced Congress into disciplined spending. University of Virginia political science professor James Savage was one of the few academics who studied the bill when it was introduced and he had problems with it. Savage and others contend that deficit reduction is not sound economic policy during a recession because more federal investment is needed to revive the economy, either through cutting taxes, lowering interest rates or spurring consumer spending through a stimulus. Now, let's look at whether Isakson has voted in favor of many substantial spending increases.Donovan's camp says Isakson went along with Republicans on a series of spending increases when the GOP controlled Congress. Much of Donovan's argument on this point deals with bills from 2001 to 2004, when Isakson was in the U.S. House. During that time, Isakson voted for several bills during a time when the gross federal debt grew from about $5.8 trillion at the end of fiscal year 2001 to nearly $7.4 trillion by the end of fiscal year 2004. The debt was projected to rise to $13.8 trillion for the fiscal year that ended Sept. 30. Isakson voted in 2002 to spend $350 billion over 10 years for a prescription drug benefit for Medicare. Additionally, he voted for bills that increased defense spending by about 10 percent a year and legislation that raised the discretionary spending cap from $661 billion in 2001 to $819 billion in 2004. The senator has been more of a fiscal hawk since Democrats became the majority party in Congress in 2007, Donovan said.The senator voted in 2006 with 51 of his 54 fellow Republicans to increase the national debt limit by $787 billion, raising the debt ceiling to $9 trillion. Some senators defended the decision, saying additional funds were needed for health and education programs. Isakson also voted in 2008 for the $700 billion TARP but has since criticized expansion of that legislation.So where does this leave us on Donovan's statement about Isakson? The October 1, 2010 truth-o-meter says an allegation made on the website of Chuck Donovan, Libertarian Party U.S. Senate candidate, is half true. The article notes that I researched and wrote the provision—which is correct. The provision reads: Mr. Isakson never proposed, nor voted in favor of, a substantial cut in federal spending; however, he has voted in favor of: (a) many substantial increases in federal spending; and (b) tremendous annual deficits. The article did not consider the four facets of the statement, but instead focused on spending. The allegedly untrue part is the part about Mr. Isaksons proposals relating to, and votes for, substantially cutting spending. Cited in favor of Mr. Isakson are proposed caps on discretionary spending, Mr. Isaksons support for biennial budgeting and Mr. Isaksons support of the Pay It Back Act, which reportedly requires money paid back by banks and other businesses who received taxpayer dollars from the TARP be used towards deficit reduction. These things are not bad things, but they do not reduce spending at all. Concerning caps on future discretionary spending, it appears the reporter or the truth-o-meter judges, or both, failed to distinguish a cut in spending from a limit on future spending increases. Also cited is the Stop Over Spending (SOS) bill, which I was told by the reporter with whom I met was the only thing the Isakson campaign cited in its defense. As I explained to the reporter, nothing in the SOS bill requires that any spending be substantially cut at all. I thoroughly provided reasoning therefore. I gave the reporter examples of things that would result in a substantial cut in spending, such as repeal of Medicare Part D. According to the Medicare Trustees, Medicare Part D had a present value liability figure in 2008 that exceeded 31 percent the net worth of all Americans combined as of the end of 2009. I encourage all readers to read the SOS bill (it can be found online). Also cited in favor of the senator is his vote against a spending increase relating to Iraq and Hurricane Katrina recovery efforts because it included $700 million in earmarks. Voting against a spending increase is not proposing, or voting in favor of, a cut (or a substantial cut) in spending. The only thing cited to cut spending was small proposed cut in Medicare and Medicaid that would reportedly have cut 2 percent from budget deficit forecasts over five years. The spending cuts were estimated to be $36 billion. The per-year average spending cut would be $7.2 billion (i.e. $36 billion divided by 5). Total federal spending for 2008 amounted to approximately $2,983 billion. I do not believe something that could cut spending by 0.2 percent (i.e. 7.2 divided by 2,983) could reasonably be considered to substantially cut spending. It is akin to a 2 cent saving on a good that would ordinarily cost $10. After publication, through email correspondence with the reporter, I was told the truth-o-meter judges felt the average person would consider the SOS and pay-go, etc. as significant efforts to cut spending. I replied by first noting that Senator Isakson consistently voted against pay-go when his party was in power. I also offered the following example that an ordinary reasonable person could understand: If an individual said his family spends $1,000 per week but plans to limit future spending increases, but the individual said no other actions would be taken regarding spending, no ordinary reasonable person would think that person had planned to cut his familys spending, let alone cut the spending substantially. Martindale-Hubbell is the organization that rates lawyers, and the rating is done by other lawyers. I have, and for many years have had, an AV rating from Martindale-Hubbell. An AV rating is the highest rating in terms of work quality and integrity (including honesty). Simply put, I tell the truth. In sum, Senator Isakson never proposed, nor voted in favor of, a substantial cut in spending. Thus, I told the truth. The GAO said in 2007: GAOs long-term simulations continue to show ever larger deficits resulting in a federal debt burden that ultimately spirals out of control. While I am very disheartened by the truth-o-meter article, what is really sad is that you have helped Mr. Isakson so he can continue fulfilling GAOs prophesy.

Final Rating: Half True  ","Americans will spend more on taxes in 2015 than on food, clothing and housing combined.","On April 14, 2015, Scott Walker asked followers of his personal Twitter account if theyve been taxed enough already. Did you know, Americans will spend more on taxes in 2015 than on food, clothing and housing combined? Walkers campaign team tweeted. (We know Walker didnt personally pen it because its signed TW, for Team Walker). The tweet highlighted a chart showing Americans collectively paid $4.8 trillion in taxes in 2014, more than the total of the three life essentials. Its a claim PolitiFact National checked in 2014 and 2011 after identical statements by the Tax Foundation and Republican National Committee chairman Reince Priebus, respectively. Both those were rated Half True. Lets see what the latest figures show. Digging into the numbers Walkers campaign told us he relied on the Tax Foundations annual tax freedom day report. Among other things, that report examines taxing and spending figures based on U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis data. Both the Tax Foundation and Walker make clear they are using collective taxing and spending figures -- by using a chart, in Walkers case, and words and charts in the Tax Foundations case. One cautionary note: Full data is not yet available for 2015, since we are not even at the midpoint of the year. The Tax Foundation based its claim about 2015 on 2014 figures that it adjusts for economic growth predicted by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, said Kyle Pomerleau, an economist with the group. We checked the BEAs data for 2014, the latest available, and found a significant edge for total taxes paid over the aggregate amount spend on food, housing and clothing. Total spending on groceries, restaurant meals, clothing, footwear, housing and utilities came to $4.2 trillion. Meanwhile, taxes -- local, state and federal -- rang up to $4.9 trillion. For perspective, total personal consumer expenditures, which includes additional things like vehicles, recreation and health care, were $11.9 trillion in 2014. In recent years, the federal figures show, taxes have consistently topped food, shelter and clothing. Another perspective But PolitiFact Nationals earlier work points out there is another way to look at the comparison: by examining what individual Americans pay. Thats a complex task, but one way to do it is to examine what people at different income levels spend and pay in taxes as a share of their total income. Through that lens, many poorer Americans likely pay a higher share of their income on food, shelter and clothing, in part because they pay little in taxes. Conversely, richer Americans may well pay a higher fraction of their income in taxes and a smaller share for those essentials. So by this other method, for many people, Walkers claim does not hold up. The 2014 item concluded that a majority of Americans probably pay more for the three essentials than for taxes. Our rating Walker claimed, based on what happened in 2014, that Americans in 2015 collectively will spend more on taxes than they do on food, housing and clothing combined. The statement is partially accurate -- on target based on past experience by the method Walker uses, but inaccurate by another method that examines the claim in a fuller context. Thats a Half True on our meter.",0.5,0.5,1,0.5,0,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,Half True

Final Rating: Half True  ",Republican state Sens. Paul Newton and Warren Daniel refused to even give testimony in North Carolinas latest redistricting case.,"Some North Carolina Democrats say gerrymandering efforts were worse in the state Senate than in the state House, in part because two Republican senators didnt testify during a recent redistricting trial. North Carolina legislators redraw the state voting maps every decade after new census data come out. The political party in power typically draws the districts to favor themselves, often prompting lawsuits from critics. That happened again last year. Voting rights groups sued leaders in the Republican-led state House and state Senate, arguing their maps are unconstitutional partisan gerrymanders. A panel of Superior Court judges ruled in favor of the Republicans. So the plaintiffs then appealed to the state Supreme Court. On Jan. 31, ahead of oral arguments before the high court, the North Carolina House Democrats Twitter account tweeted: House Republicans admitted to secret maps and destruction of evidence, but Sens. Paul Newton and Warren Daniel refused to even give testimony. So the question is—what the hell was going on in the [state Senate] that was so much worse than what was happening in the House? Republicans refuted the tweet. Senate Leader Phil Bergers communications team called the Democrats claim evidence-free conspiracy theorizing. Theres a lot to unpack in this tweet, which takes some facts from the redistricting case and frames them in a way that could lead some to think the lawmakers engaged in wrongdoing. First, a portion of the House Democrats claim about secret maps is accurate but some of it is difficult to prove. During the lower-court trial, Republican state Rep. Destin Hall said he and his staffers consulted secret concept maps while leading the chambers restricting process. He said the maps didnt incorporate any racial or partisan gerrymanders. But its unclear whether the maps were intentionally destroyed. The defendants, in court documents, said only that the maps were were not saved, are currently lost and no longer exist. While that may raise questions about records retention, it doesnt prove that the maps were intentionally destroyed. The state Supreme Court overturned the maps on Feb. 4, and ten days later cited the concept maps in its full opinion. One reason the N.C. House Democrats tweet stands out: the secret maps were on the House side—but the tweet makes claims about the Senate. As for Daniel and Newton testifying, its true that they declined to answer questions in a deposition. But its misleading to suggest their silence is indicative of wrongdoing, since they asked the court for—and were granted—protections offered by state laws. The tweet also could give some readers the impression that senate Republicans didnt answer questions at all. Thats not the case. Sen. Ralph Hise, the highest-ranking co-chairman of the state Senates redistricting committee, was deposed and later testified on the third day of the Superior Court trial. Lets review the facts. The N.C. House Democrats Twitter account is run by the Democratic Partys state House caucus. Amanda Eubanks, the caucus executive director, told PolitiFact NC the refused to testify claim is a reference to Daniel and Newton invoking legislative privilege, a state law that can protect legislators from having to provide information about some aspects of the lawmaking process. Before the redistricting trial, plaintiffs sought to depose Daniel, Newton, Berger and House Speaker Tim Moore, also a Republican. Those lawmakers cited legislative privilege and asked to be exempt from the depositions, a motion the court granted on Dec. 24. Once Daniel and Newton were exempted from depositions, they were viewed as ineligible to testify on the stand. So even if they wanted to testify in the trial, its unlikely that they would have been called upon. That said, the scope of legislative privilege is not well defined in state law. So, in a hypothetical case in which a legislator seeks to avoid questioning, a judge could compel a legislator to answer questions about details that arent protected by legislative immunity, lawyers told PolitiFact NC. There are some things in public records like communications between legislators and legislative staff, or when they go to the research group and say, If I propose this, is it legal? Youre not going to get it because its confidential, said Mike Tadych, a partner at law firm Stevens Martin Vaughn & Tadych PLLC, which represents the North Carolina Press Association. But in a trial, you typically cant just assert legislative privilege because youre a legislator and you dont want to talk, said Kym Hunter, a senior attorney for the Southern Environmental Law Center. Legislative privilege could apply potentially to certain parts of what they would be questioned about, but theres certainly many, many aspects which wouldn't be subject to legislative privilege. Voting rights group Common Cause, a plaintiff in the case, included Berger and Daniel on its witness list filing on Dec. 31—after the senators had already been granted legislative privilege. Common Cause didnt call upon either senator during trial, but in court documents the group said it reserves the right to challenge legislative privilege on appeal. The N.C. House Democrats tweet implies that silence by Daniel and Newton is indicative that the Senates behavior was somehow worse than that of Republicans in the House. The accusation is vague and hard to quantify without more information about what action is being measured. When it comes to alleged gerrymandering, none of the three maps drawn by Republican lawmakers stand out as being significantly more partisan than the others. Experts at Princeton University reviewed the state House, state Senate and the congressional maps, giving each an F grade, due to significant Republican advantage. We asked Eubanks what N.C. House Democrats meant by the statement, and she never directly answered the question. Hise, meanwhile, testified that the state Senate and House redistricting processes were very different. Hise noted that he, Daniel and Newton used the same staff assistance provided by Bergers office. He said he wasnt aware of any secret maps being used on the Senate side because all maps were required to be drawn in public view. Hise acknowledged that he never issued a specific directive banning staff from looking at concept maps outside of public view—something state Supreme Court justices noted in their recent opinion—but he said aides were aware of the rules. While the N.C. House Democrats tweet raises questions about the senate process, Berger spokeswoman Lauren Horsch noted that Hises testimony wasnt disputed in court. She added that Hise testified—and the others didnt—in part because the trial was under time constraints. The N.C. House Democrats Twitter account said Newton and Daniel refused to even give testimony in North Carolinas redistricting case. So the question is—what the hell was going on in the [state Senate] that was so much worse than what was happening in the House? Its true that they did not give testimony. But thats because the senators invoked a legal protection called legislative privilege that allowed them to opt out of answering questions in the case. That move alone doesnt necessarily mean they have something to hide. The tweet is partially accurate but leaves out important details, which is our definition of Half True.",0.5,0.5,1,0.5,0,0.5,0.5,1,0.5,Half True

Final Rating: Half True",Says IBM leader told Obama that using IBM technology to cut fraud could pay for health care reform.,"During a discussion of health care costs at a Nov. 5, 2011, two-person GOP presidential debate outside Houston, Republican presidential candidate Newt Gingrich made a dramatic claim about a White House visit.Gingrich, who was debating then-candidate Herman Cain, said: The CEO of IBM went to the White House and said to (President) Barack Obama, you can pay for virtually all of Obamacare by simply taking existing IBM technology and applying it to stop paying crooks.By Obamacare, a term that some view as polarizing shorthand, Gingrich meant the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, the Democrat-led 2010 overhaul of health care laws. Obama affixed a price tag of $900 billion to the plan when he rolled out his version in September 2009. Subsequent cost estimates varied. So, Gingrich is suggesting a lot of fraud. But was he right that IBM presented the president with such a scheme?By way of background, we note that Gingrich has long advocated using technology to help cut health-care costs. Until recently he led a for-profit consultancy called the Center for Health Transformations, which counted IBM among its clients.We asked Gingrichs campaign for the former House speakers basis in making the statement. Spokesman Joe DeSantis told us: All I can say is that he heard it from someone he trusts. Sorry.But DeSantis directed us to video of a Sept. 14, 2010, Wall Street Journal interview of Sam Palmisano, IBMs then-CEO and chairman.Separately, IBM spokesman Ed Barbini also referred us to the Journal interview. He declined further comment.The video opens with the Journals Alan Murray saying: When President Obama was elected, you started spending a fair amount of time at the White House.Palmisano: Yes, I did.Murray: What was that all about?Well, Palmisano replied, part of it was the administration was reaching out to the business community. I mean, I was one of many, obviously ... around economic (issues)... So we were having lots of input, lots of exchange. Thats what we all were working on at the time.Asked how he thought the White House visits had turned out, Palmisano replied: We havent made any progress. It doesnt mean there hasnt been a lot of interaction.Murray: Well, whats the point of interaction if it doesnt lead to progress?Palmisano: Youd have to ask the people who arent progressing.He added, Weve done tons of work, and for whatever sets of reasons, we havent been able to establish, be in sync with, the priorities.Palmisano offered an example: We -- and Im fairly confident about this one because it required no legislative change -- we could have improved quality and reduced the costs of the health-care system by $900 billion... It was self-funding. You could have insured anybody you wanted to, illegal aliens, dogs, cats, ponies, whatever, right? And the stuff was simple. Did not require any big legislative change.About $400 billion of the reduced costs could be realized through negotiating discounts with drug companies, just as IBM negotiates its own discounts, he said. Buy a nationwide discount, he said. Just like pharmaceutical companies sell to us on a nationwide discount. Its no different. I said, Take the IBM discount! Take the IBM discount. Another example of savings: Two hundred billion in fraud. That was a 3 percent improvement, by the way. This wasnt transformational. ... Theres so much fraud in the system -- 3 percent and then Year 7 was 8 percent, Year 5 was 5 percent. Its 200 billion.Murray: And why didnt they do that? Is there a fraud --Palmisano: I said we would do it for free to prove that it works. They turned us down. Youll have to ask them Free. Free wasnt good enough.Murray asks again: Why?Palmisano replies, I think what it is, not to be judgmental about these things, I really do think what it is is that we weren't aligning with the priorities. ... the priority at the time, if I stay on my example of health care, was not to reduce costs and improve quality. It was to provide insurance and coverage for more people. That was our priority in the line. All we said, if you did this you could fund the priority without increasing the deficit, taking taxes up. And we couldn't sell the case.Lets take a breath here. In the Journal interview, Palmisano insisted he gave the White House an offer to cover the $900 billion estimated cost of the health care plan -- with $200 billion coming from reduced fraud.We were unable to find independent confirmation of such an offer -- and our search of news archives indicates the CEOs comments to the Journal touched off only one follow-up news account. Nearly a month after the interview, on the Oct. 8, 2010, episode of a Fox News program, guest host Stuart Varney said that an IBM spokesman stood by Palmisanos claims.That program aired shortly after a more widely publicized event: On Oct. 6, 2010, Palmisano led a group of high-tech CEOs to the White House to present Obama with a proposal they said could save the government $1 trillion by 2020.Among the plans seven initiatives: saving $500 billion by streamlining supply chains and pushing suppliers to reduce costs; and saving $200 billion by using technology to better detect improper payments -- payments that prove to be unnecessary or fraudulent. The proposal cites an Office of Management and Budget estimate that Medicare accounted for $54 billion of the governments $98 billion in improper payments in 2009.By email, White House spokesman Brandon Lepow did not provide information confirming or denying Palmisanos claims to the Journal about presenting savings ideas. Lepow initially said companies including IBM had offered the administration help fighting fraud. He later told us he had learned his first statement was inaccurate. His follow-up statement said the administration and IBM had worked on possible projects but agreed not to move forward, although IBM is a partner in our work to fight fraud.Our rulingGingrich did not reveal the source of his claim or provide backup beyond the Journal interview. Meantime, the White House did not confirm or deny Palmisanos claims. Contrary to Gingrichs debate claim, though, the then-CEO said $200 billion in funding would come from cutting fraud -- not nearly enough to pay for the health-care overhaul.",0.5,0.5,1,0.5,0,0,0.5,0.5,0.5,Half True

Final Rating: Half True  ","Says Tony Evers wants to cut Wisconsin's prison population in half, a dangerous plan that today would mean releasing thousands of violent criminals back into our communities.","A week before the primary vote, when Republican Gov. Scott Walker didnt know which opponent he would face in the Nov. 6, 2018 general election, he tweeted this claim: A number of Democrats running for governor want to cut the prison population by 50% and that would require the release of thousands of violent felons.  Our rating was Half True. There was no evidence to back up the require part of Walkers claim, particularly if a 50 percent reduction were done over a period of years, rather than swiftly. A new, similar Walker attack — zeroing in on Tony Evers — has a similar problem. All our fact checks in the governors race. On Sept. 12, 2018, a month after Evers, the state schools superintendent, emerged from the primary as the Democratic nominee, Walker elevated his attack to a television ad. The governors spot begins with a narrator portraying Evers as putting the public at risk, saying he failed to remove abusive teachers from our schools. Then the narrator asserts that Evers wants to cut Wisconsin's prison population in half, a dangerous plan that today would mean releasing thousands of violent criminals back into our communities. Walkers use of the word today aims to avoid the problem that the word require caused in his previous fact check. That is, a 50 percent reduction today — rather than say, over a period of years — would require the release of thousands of inmates convicted of violent crimes. There are currently about 23,000 inmates, two-thirds of whom have committed a violent offense, according to the state Department of Corrections. That two-thirds portion includes inmates being held for a violent-crime conviction; and it includesthose who served their time behind bars for that original offense, but were returned to prison for violating conditions of probation orextended supervision that was also part of the sentence for the original offense. Violent offenses include crimes such as murder, rape and robbery, as well as crimes such as assault, extortion and hit-and-run with bodily injury. But Evers has not put a time frame on how he would achieve a 50 percent reduction. And its important to keep in mind that releasing half the inmates who are in prison isnt the only way to cut the prison population in half. Like us on Facebook. Follow us on Twitter: @PolitiFactWisc. On the day Walkers TV ad was released, Evers reacted by telling reporters: Thats a lie. I never said that. We will not release violent criminals. Were not going to get in the gutter with Scott Walker. (Walker has also made a claim similar to the one in his TV ad in a private telephone poll of voters done by his campaign.) To back the first part of Walkers claim — that Evers supports a 50 percent cut -- Walkers campaign cites an exchange during a July 12, 2018 debate between Democrats who were running for governor. A reference was made to the group Milwaukee Inner-City Congregations Allied for Hope. Moderator: The multi-racial interfaith organization MICAH launched a campaign in 2011 to cut the state prison population by half, from 22,000 to 11,000. It now sits at 23,000. Do you support that original goal, and how would you balance reducing the prison population — Evers: Absolutely, and that's a goal thats worth accomplishing  We have to stop people incarcerating people for non-violent crimes. The Walker campaign argues that Evers response means he is committing to a 50 percent reduction over four years because MICAHs website refers to a campaign in 2011 to get the 50 percent cut by 2015. But neither the question to Evers, nor his response, mentions four years. And we found no evidence that Evers has committed to any time frame. Evers has said Wisconsin should cut parole revocations and expand drug courts as ways of reducing the number of people being sent to prison. He has also said he would consider releasing some inmates early; treating 17-year-olds as juveniles instead of adults for criminal charges; and overhauling truth-in-sentencing so prisoners could be released for good behavior. Kenneth Streit, a clinical professor of law emeritus at the University of Wisconsin Law School, told us its possible to achieve a 50 percent cut without releasing inmates convicted of violent crimes — or at least not thousands of them. Streit has studied corrections policy since 1990 and has assisted the Legislature and the Department of Corrections in developing and evaluating adult community corrections programs. He said the population could be reduced by about 5 percent annually over the next decade through steps such as changing sentencing guidelines and tripling funding for treatment-based probation that would reduce the number of people going back to prison for probation revocations.  Whether a 10-year time frame, or longer, would be acceptable to advocates for the 50 percent reduction is unclear; many want a quicker turnaround. But, despite Walkers claim, its also not clear that Evers would seek a 50 percent cut over a period that would force the release of thousands of inmates convicted of violent crimes. One more point before we close: Ryan King, research director at the nonprofit Justice Policy Institute, who formerly did studies for the Urban Institute and the Pew Research Center, said research shows that people who are in prison for violence are less likely to be rearrested after release than people sentenced for other offenses. Walker says Evers wants to cut Wisconsin's prison population in half, a dangerous plan that today would mean releasing thousands of violent criminals back into our communities. Evers has stated that a 50 percent reduction is a goal. But he has not put a time frame on achieving that — a crucial factor in determining whether inmates of convicted of violent crimes would have to be released. Experts say a 50 percent reduction over a relatively short period, say a few years, would require the release of inmates convicted of violent crimes. But some say its possible to cut the population in half, perhaps over 10 years, without the release of any violent offenders, or at least not thousands of them.For a statement that is partially accurate, our rating is Half True.",0.5,0.7,0.9,0.6,0.8,0.7,0.4,0.6,0.5,Half True

Final Rating: Half True",Says Massachusetts has three state-mandated student tests and Finland just one.,"Saying Texas students face too many state-mandated exams, an East Texas member of the State Board of Education suggested two faraway places enjoy stellar results with minimal government-imposed testing.In an opinion column published in the Dec. 10, 2012, Austin American-Statesman, Thomas Ratliff, R-Mount Pleasant, said: Massachusetts, the envy of all public school systems in the United States, has three state-mandated tests. Finland, which is the envy of all public school systems in the world, has one. Thats right, one.We're not going to judge the merits of educational systems. But we have experience counting tests.Yet, as we tucked into this Massachusetts-Finland shout, we noticed Ratliffs article does not say if hes critical of every exam given under the State of Texas Assessments of Academic Readiness system. That testing starts in the third grade.By phone, Ratliff told us that he was thinking only of the state's 11 to 15 newly-installed end-of-course exams that high-school students must hurdle to qualify for graduation.So, what of Massachusetts and Finland?Ratliff said he drew his Massachusetts test count from Austin lawyer Dineen Majcher, who helped launch Texans Advocating for Meaningful Student Assessment amid concerns the 2009 Legislature's overhaul of student testing and accountability went overboard.Majcher pointed us to a Massachusetts government web page, for the Bay States Department of Elementary and Secondary Education, indicating that high-school students should attain proficient scores on tests in English language arts and math and a test in any of several science-oriented subjects: biology, chemistry, introductory physics or technology/engineering. Students who do not meet the states proficient score on either test can still graduate, according to the agency, by fulfilling an educational proficiency plan entailing more classwork and testing.By email, department spokesman J.C. Considine told us that outside of the states high-school tests, students in grades three through eight must take standardized state exams. According to an agency web page, results are used to hold schools accountable for progress toward the federal goal that all U.S. students be proficient in reading and math by 2014.Now lets flip to Finland.Ratliff pointed us to an article in the September 2011 issue of Smithsonian, the magazine produced by the Smithsonian Institution, saying that students there have outperformed counterparts in other countries thanks to in a focus on well-prepared teachers who decide how best to school their individual pupils. The story also says there are no mandated standardized tests in Finland, apart from one exam at the end of students senior year in high school.The test is the Finnish Matriculation Exam, according to a Finnish government web page, which says the exams purpose is to discover whether pupils have assimilated the knowledge and skills required by the curriculum for the upper secondary school and whether they have reached an adequate level of maturity in line with that school`s goals. Passing the Matriculation Examination entitles the candidate to continue his or her studies at university.According to the web page, the exam is given each spring and fall.However, the exam is not a one-and-done. Its composed of at least four tests, one that each student must take in his or her mother tongue—Finnish, Swedish or Saami—and three others at their choice either on the second national language or a foreign language; math; or a test in the sciences and humanities, according to the web page, including tests in Evangelical Lutheran religion, Orthodox religion, ethics, philosophy, psychology, history, social studies, physics, chemistry, biology, geography and health education.As part of his or her examination, the candidate may additionally include one or more optional tests, the web page says.Whoa. Could each student really take more than 10 tests?Pasi Sahlberg, a Finnish expert in education and director general of the Helsinki-based Centre for International Mobility and Cooperation, confirmed by email that the overall standardized exam consists of a minimum of four tests, but students if they wish can take more exams. Typically, he said, students take five or six tests. These may be spread over a 12-month period, he said, though most students take most of their tests in the spring of their last school year. Notably, too, Sahlberg emailed, Finnish students who focus on vocational training after completing the countrys nine mandatory years of basic education do not have to take a state-mandated exam of any kind. In 2010, 45 percent of the students who continued their schooling after the nine years chose the vocational track, Satu Mäki-Lassila of Finlands Ministry of Education and Culture told us by email.Our rulingRatliff wrote that Massachusetts has three mandated student tests and Finland one.Both claims reflect the exams that students in Massachusetts and Finland have to take to qualify for high school graduation.But students on the academic track in Finland must take at least four separate tests. Also, given that Ratliffs article does not say hes speaking only to tests administered in high school, its worth noting that Massachusetts, like Texas, requires students starting in third grade to take state tests.This claim grades out as Half True. CLARIFICATION, 10:00 a.m., Dec. 19, 2012: We amended this article to point out that Finnish students who focus on vocational courses at the secondary level do not have to take a government-mandated exam to graduate.

Final Rating: Half True  ",The income tax that started at 2 percent under Governor Byrne is now 9 percent.,"Whet the appetite of liberal politicians with a new tax and Gov. Chris Christie warns theyll become ravenous. Thats why Christie told a crowd in New Hampshire they should vote on Nov. 6 for Ovide Lamontagne, the Republican candidate for governor of the Granite State. Otherwise New Hampshire, which doesnt tax wages, may go the way of New Jersey.Christie said 35 years ago New Jersey also didnt have an income tax, but then Governor Brendan Byrne, a Democrat, said if you just give me a small income tax, just a little one, I will lower your property taxes, for the people who have the highest property taxes in America back in 1977. So 35 years later, what have we got? We still have the highest property taxes in America and the income tax that started at 2 percent under Governor Byrne is now 9 percent -- 9 percent.Here's the key everybody: you let a liberal politician in the door and give them permission to give you a new tax, they only know one direction for that tax to go and that's up, Christie said at the Sept. 25 event.Did New Jerseys income tax more than quadruple since it was first enacted, as Christie said?The governors statement is partially accurate because a group of individuals -- those earning more than $500,000 in taxable income -- are now subject to a statutory income tax rate of 8.97 percent.But those individuals represent only a small percentage of filers in New Jersey and the tax rates are lower for other income levels. The governors office did not respond to requests for comment, but the history of the states income tax is clear.In 1976 -- during Byrnes first term -- the state passed a temporary income tax with two rates. A 2 percent rate was levied on income less than $20,000 or about $80,000 in todays dollars, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. Income in excess of $20,000 was taxed at the top rate of 2.5 percent. A year after the temporary tax was enacted, the state made it permanent. Over time New Jersey modeled its income tax into a more progressive system, which now has rates ranging from 1.4 percent to 8.97 percent depending on income level and filing status.The states top rate is 8.97 percent, which only applies to income in excess of $500,000. Less than 2 percent of taxable New Jersey resident returns in 2009 had that level of income, according to state Treasury Department data. An individual with taxable income between $75,000 and $500,000 pays a 6.37 percent rate on that income. For income between $40,000 and $75,000, the rate is about 5.5 percent.The lowest rates are 1.4 percent and 1.75 percent, which are lower than the states rates in 1976. Those rates apply to incomes below $20,000 or between $20,000 and $35,000, respectively.So for Christie to suggest the income tax, in general, jumped from 2 percent to 9 percent is misleading. Thats true for one income level, but the statement oversimplifies New Jerseys current income tax system.Our rulingChristie said, The income tax that started at 2 percent under Governor Byrne is now 9 percent.When the state first implemented an income tax in 1976, two rates existed -- 2 percent for income less than $20,000 and 2.5 percent for income more than $20,000 -- but the state has since introduced a more progressive tax system. New Jerseys top rate is nearly 9 percent now, but applies only to taxable income above $500,000.Every other income bracket is subject to a rate lower than 9 percent, with some income levels charged a rate of less than 2 percent.To comment on this ruling, go to NJ.com.

Final Rating: Half True  ","Less than two years ago, we made a commitment to repay the U.S. . . .taxpayers in full, and today we made good on that promise.","In an announcement reminiscent of one made by GM around this time last year, Chrysler Group LLC boasted this week that it had paid back money lent to it by the American government, with interest, six years ahead of schedule.President Barack Obama, who is expected to highlight the milestone in a visit to a Toledo, Ohio, Chrysler plant on June 3, called the repayment a significant milestone for the turnaround of Chrysler and the countless communities and families who rely on the American auto industry. He and other Democrats adopted an I-told-you-so stance, with some Democrats taking the opportunity to remind the public that many Republicans opposed the auto bailouts.In a press release from Chrysler Group LLC announcing the loan repayment, the company's Chief Executive Officer Sergio Marchionne stated, Less than two years ago, we made a commitment to repay the U.S. and Canadian taxpayers in full, and today we made good on that promise.For this item, we're going to focus on whether the company repaid U.S. taxpayers. Chrysler Group LLC repaid $5.1 billion in Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) loans and formally terminated its ability to draw from a remaining $2.1 billion line of credit extended through TARP. Together with interest and fees, Chrysler Group has now paid $6.5 billion to the U.S. Treasury. It borrowed $5.1 billion from the U.S. government when it began operations under new ownership in June 2009. In addition, the U.S. Treasury still holds a 6.6 percent common equity stake in Chrysler Group.So is Chrysler now really square with the American taxpayer?The press release doesn't mention it, but there's more to the government's investment in Chrysler than the loans to Chrysler Group LLC.In its own press release about Chrysler's loan repayment, the U.S. Department of Treasury lays out a more complete picture of taxpayer support of Chrysler:Treasury committed a total of $12.5 billion to Chrysler under TARPs Automotive Industry Financing Program (AIFP), the release states. With todays transaction, Chrysler has returned more than $10.6 billion of that amount to taxpayers through principal repayments, interest, and cancelled commitments. Treasury continues to hold a 6.6 percent common equity stake in Chrysler. As previously stated, however, Treasury is unlikely to fully recover its remaining outstanding investment of $1.9 billion in Chrysler.In an interview with MSNBC's Andrea Mitchell on May 24, 2011, Ron Bloom, assistant to President Obama in charge of manufacturing policy, broke it down more plainly:Today, Chrysler is reducing their obligation to the U.S. taxpayer by $8 billion. They have previously provided us with $2.6 billion of funds. So, that $10.6 (billion) stacks up against $8.5 billion that the president invested in Chrysler and $4 billion from the prior administration. So, that's over 100 percent of all monies that this administration invested and about 85 percent of the total invested funds by the United States government.So how can the Chrysler Group LLC claim to have squared its obligation to the American taxpayers when only 85 percent of the taxpayers' investment in Chrysler has been recouped?Notice how we keep writing Chrysler Group LLC. There's a reason for that. That's the new Chrysler company that emerged from bankruptcy in 2009.We'll let Gualberto Ranieri, head of communications for the Chrysler Group LLC, explain.Ranieri likened the generic use of the word Chrysler to a fruit salad, which is made up of lots of different fruits: apples, strawberries, blueberries...you get the idea. When you talk about Chrysler, there's not just one company. There's the old Chrysler, the company that was liquidated in bankruptcy. There's the new Chrysler, aka Chrysler Group LLC, the newly formed company that purchased most of the assets of Old Chrysler in a bankruptcy sale. There's also the financing firms Chrysler Financial and GMAC.We are not responsible for the old Chrysler, Ranieri said. We are not responsible for Chrysler Financial. I am not responsible for my brother's loans, even though we have the same last name.Chrysler Group CEO Marchionne can only speak for the new company, Ranieri said, and the government money extended to Chrysler Group has been fully repaid, with interest.That's technically true, Edward Niedermeyer, editor-in-chief of The Truth About Cars website wrote this week. It does, however, fail to account (again) for the $1.9 billion Debtor-in-Possession 'loan' which financed Chrysler during bankruptcy and was conveniently left to die with the remains of 'Old Chrysler.' Nor does it account for the $1.5 billion loaned to Chryslers suppliers to keep them afloat amidst the bailout chaos.Chrysler and its political bedfellows should be forgiven for a little cheering, Niedermeyer wrote. The loan repayment is a positive sign of hope for a once seemingly doomed company.Its just that taxpayers still deserve a full and transparent accounting of 'every penny' (to borrow a phrase) that actually went into Chrysler, not just 'loans made in the last two years' or 'loans made by the Obama Administration' or other weasel-wordings employed to make the bailout seem more successful than it is, Niedermeyer wrote. Though bailout supporters will doubtless argue that 'it doesnt matter' because Chrysler is alive today and 'thats what matters,' this doesnt justify a lack of transparency. In fact, if the bailout was successful because GM and Chrysler survived, thats all the more reason to not fear the truth about what the bailout actually cost.James Gattuso, a senior research fellow in regulatory policy at the conservative Heritage Foundation, said there was nearly $2 billion in taxpayer money that went down with the ship with the old shell of Chrysler. Technically, he said, Chrysler Group LLC is a different company. But from a taxpayers' perspective, there's little distinction.If the taxpayers were a bank, they wouldn't stay in business very long, he said. The taxpayers took a loss, or they are still in the red at least.Now, the U.S. Treasury still owns a 6.6 percent common equity stake in Chrysler Group. That has an undetermined value, as the company has not yet gone public. But as the Treasury itself acknowledged, Treasury is unlikely to fully recover its remaining outstanding investment of $1.9 billion in Chrysler.We asked Lawrence J. White, a professor of economics at the Stern School of Business at New York University what he made of Marchionne's statement.This certainly appears to be another instance of careful language, where all of Chrysler's statement is focused on loans to Chrysler but not the other Treasury investments, White said. Yes, this appears to be an incomplete statement.As we noted earlier, the statements made by Marchionne were similar to those made by General Motors CEO Ed Whitacre last year. But the situations are different. For one, the government took a much larger equity stake in GM. For more details, see our fact-check related to Whitacre's claims last year.Again, there may be cause for celebratory comments from Chrysler. But Marchionne's statement, while technically accurate, doesn't tell the full story. Yes, Chrysler Group LLC has fully repaid the loans made to it two years ago. But that's not the full measure of the American taxpayers' investments to try to save Chrysler, including $2 billion to old Chrysler that was wiped out in bankruptcy. We doubt taxpayers care much about the distinctions in corporate titles. The government has now gotten most of its money back, but not all of it. Not yet anyway. UPDATE: The original version of this article mentioned Canadian taxpayers in the quotation. But since we are focusing on U.S, contributions, the reference to Canada was removed from the statement.",0.5,0.5,1,0.5,0,0.5,0.5,1,0.5,Half True

Final Rating: Half True",Two-thirds of our kids cant read at grade level.,"Republican presidential candidate Marco Rubio pulled out a stunning statistic about the current state of K-12 education while making the case for school choice. Two-thirds of our kids cant read at grade level, Rubio wrote in a recent Medium post. We wondered whether the situation in American schools was really that bad, so we took a closer look. Rubios source was the National Assessment of Educational Progress, or NAEP, a closely watched, federally sponsored standardized-testing effort. The most recent NAEP data for fourth- and eighth-grade students covers 2015. It offers four categories of achievement. From lowest to highest, they are below basic, basic, proficient, and advanced. The two most relevant categories for this fact-check are basic and proficient, and neither levels definition mentions reading on grade level. Basic is defined as denoting partial mastery of prerequisite knowledge and skills that are fundamental for proficient work at each grade assessed. Proficient is defined as representing solid academic performance for each grade assessed and competency over challenging subject matter, including subject-matter knowledge, application of such knowledge to real-world situations, and analytical skills appropriate to the subject matter. Rubio is using the proficient level as his benchmark, and the picture that produces isnt pretty. In 2015, just 36 percent of American fourth graders were categorized as either proficient or advanced in reading. Heres the chart:  And that same year, just 34 percent of eighth graders rated as either proficient or advanced in reading. Heres the chart:  Using that metric, Rubio supports his point. But education experts advised caution. Most important is that its a bit of a stretch for Rubio to equate a NAEP rating of proficient with being at grade level. There is no commonly accepted definition for what grade level performance is or should be, said Christopher B. Swanson, vice president of Editorial Projects in Education, which publishes Education Week. NAEP, he said, is developed independently of the knowledge required by any specific state, district or school. David Bills, a professor of education at the University of Iowa, agreed. As far as I know, no one has ever tested those labels against what kids actually need to know to do well in school, Bills said. Indeed, after the No Child Left Behind education law was enacted under President George W. Bush, each state had to choose a level of proficiency, and on average, this came closer to the NAEP basic level, said Eric Hanushek, a senior fellow in education policy at the conservative Hoover Institution. If this is the case, then one could instead use the basic level under NAEP and find that the success rates are 69 percent and 76 percent for fourth and eighth graders, respectively. Still, despite such words of caution, experts said Rubios decision to use the proficient level as his benchmark was defensible. Experts also ratified Rubios use of the NAEP tests as his data source. Sure, there are lots of problems and its not a perfect measure, but that doesnt mean its meaningless in all contexts, said Patricia M. Cooper, an associate professor and program coordinator for early childhood education at Queens College-City University of New York. There arent many credible alternatives to the NAEP numbers, she said. Cooper added that even the best-case scenario isnt that great. Even if Rubios off by half, that means one-third of our kids arent reading on grade level, she said. Would that make us feel better? Our ruling Rubio said that two-thirds of our kids cant read at grade level. The numbers from the NAEP reading test for fourth and eighth graders provide some support for his statement. However, experts said that there is no accepted definition of what being at grade level means under the NAEP tests. While Rubio's use of NAEP's higher proficient standard is a reasonable choice, experts said, it's not the only one -- many states have set standards aligned with NAEP's basic level instead.",0.5,0.5,1,0.5,0,0.5,0.5,1,0.5,Half True

Final Rating: Half True  ","Already, the Affordable Care Act is helping to slow the growth of (Medicares) health care costs.","In his State of the Union address, President Barack Obama warned those who love Medicare that changes to the program are needed, because rising health care costs for seniors are the biggest driver of our long-term debt.If changes arent made, Obama warned, our retirement programs will crowd out the investments we need for our children, and jeopardize the promise of a secure retirement for future generations.Obama said he was open to changes such as asking wealthier seniors to pay more, and paying hospitals and doctors to be more efficient. But he also took credit for his signature health care law.Already, the Affordable Care Act is helping to slow the growth of health care costs, he said.From our previous fact-checking, we know that many of the major provisions of the 2010 health care law have yet to take effect. So how can the law already be slowing the growth of health care costs? We decided to check it out.Slowing spendingAs Obama made his speech, the White House posted slides on its website to back up Obamas key points.For his health care comment, a chart showed Medicare spending projections from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, both before the passage of the Affordable Care Act and afterward. The chart shows the future growth noticeably slowing after the laws passage. (View the chart here.) The numbers were part of the CBO's regular update on the countrys economic outlook and the federal budget. We reviewed the latest numbers, which were released on Feb. 5, 2013, as well as news coverage of the findings.In its report, the CBO says that health care spending has grown much more slowly in recent years, both for federal programs and overall, than it did in previous years. In response to that slowing growth, the CBO reduced its projections for future Medicare spending. Since March 2010, the CBO has lowered its projections for Medicare spending in 2020 by roughly 15 percent, the report said.However, the CBO did not specifically credit the Affordable Care Act as the reason for lowering the projections. Some aspects of the law, the report said, will slightly increase federal outlays in Medicare and Medicaid.But the CBO did say it was revising estimates based on actual reduced growth in health care spending since at least 2010.Health care law phasing inAs we noted above, the health care law isnt fully in effect yet. A new requirement for Americans to get health insurance or pay a penalty won't take effect until 2014, for example.For the Medicare program, the law includes both spending and cost savings.Beneficiaries can now receive expanded prescription drug coverage and preventive care without co-pays under the law; but those benefits increase costs.On the other hand, the law has also put in place limits on payments to private insurance companies that operate the Medicare Advantage program, which saves money. Changes in payments to hospitals have also already started. That means financial incentives for hospitals that are more efficient and penalties for those that are not.When we asked White House staff for more evidence to support Obamas comments, they pointed us to a January memo from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, which specifically pointed to limits on Medicare Advantage and changes to hospital payments.Finally, a controversial Medicare payments commission -- the Independent Payment Advisory Board -- would make recommendations to make payments more efficient, reducing spending. But that board hasnt yet convened, and it may never convene if Medicare meets pre-determined budget targets.Trends in health care spendingGetting back to health care costs, its clear that the growth in spending is going down, both for overall health spending and Medicare. But whats driving it? We found that experts consider it something of an interesting puzzle.Some blame the recession and the economy. When people feel poor, they dont spend as much, even on health care. Under this scenario, health care spending will rebound when the economy is better.Others say the overall health care system is changing, moving away from payments for each procedure and test, and moving toward payments for better overall outcomes. The health care law includes provisions to encourage that switch. If this is the case, reduced spending growth should become permanent.We found a diversity of opinion on whats going on here, and whether Obamas comment was accurate.Medicare spending slowed down in 2010-12, so this is not just a projection, said Jonathan Oberlander, a professor of health policy at the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill. Much of the law is not yet implemented, yet some Affordable Care Act provisions to control Medicare spending -- like changes in what Medicare Advantage plans are paid -- are already in effect, and were expected to produce savings during 2011-12.Other experts are dubious that the law is having much effect at all, such as Yuval Levin, a fellow at the Ethics and Public Policy Center and a domestic policy staffer on health care issues for President George W. Bush.The reduction in overall health costs has had above all to do with the weak economy, and while CBO does suggest that its projections of the effects of the Affordable Care Act have changed in a few ways since it passed in 2010 (causing both upward and downward revisions of the effects on costs), those are all projections for after 2014, when the key substantive provisions of the law will take effect, he said. None of them could be used to suggest that already, the Affordable Care Act is helping to slow the growth of health care costs.The Obama administration argues that its more than a weak economy driving reductions in spending. The economic recession may have contributed to the 2010-12 decrease in growth in per beneficiary spending as consumers use less care due to its cost, says the HHS memo. However, as almost all Medicare beneficiaries have supplemental coverage and thus face relatively low out-of-pocket costs, it seems unlikely that consumer behavior alone is responsible for the slow growth in Medicare spending.Deborah Chollet, a senior fellow at Mathematica Policy Research, said the health care system is responding to the new law already. Insurance companies and other payers know about the new payment methods the law supports, and they are planning accordingly, she said.Its really not at all a situation of the lights turning on Jan. 1, 2014. The lights have been on for the past six months, she said.Still, determining causes behind the spending slowdown is no easy task, warned Bradley Herring, professor at the Bloomberg School of Public Health at Johns Hopkins University.I think most people think the slowdown weve seen in health care spending over the last three years has been due to the recession. But no ones 100 percent sure why that happened, he said.Things will get even more complicated for health policy researchers as the law deploys changes to payments and other pilot programs. Researchers will have to hypothesize how much costs decline compared with if the law had not passed.Those are going to be difficult things to measure, Herring said.Well close with comments from Douglas Elmendorf, head of the Congressional Budget Office. He spoke to reporters when the office released new numbers on Feb. 5:So, health spending has grown slowly over the past few years, both in federal programs and in the rest of the health care systems. We think that part of that owes to the recession and the loss of income in wealth, but we think that a significant part of that probably does not stem from the recession, probably arises from structural changes in the health care system.The critical question is, whether those structural changes are very transitory changes or whether they will persist. We're doing analysis to that question. We're talking with outside experts who are also investigating the same question. I think the short summary of that is that we don't know.Our rulingObama said, Already, the Affordable Care Act is helping to slow the growth of health care costs.Hes right that health care costs are slowing, but theres not conclusive evidence that the law is helping. The nonpartisan reports from the Congressional Budget Office dont specifically say that, and some aspects of the health law translate to increased spending.Among health care experts, we found debate over how much the Affordable Care Act is contributing to an overall slowdown in health spending. Some argue that the recession is making people spend less on health care. Others say the health care system is changing to become more efficient. Many say that more study is needed.Obamas taking credit for more than he can prove.",0.5,0.5,1.0,0.6,0.2,0.5,0.4,0.7,0.5,Half True

Final Rating: Half True",John McCain fought to rein in Fannie and Freddie...but Democrats blocked the reforms.,"Seeking to portray Sen. John McCain as prescient on the financial crisis, McCain's campaign unveiled anew advertisementsaying he had spotted problems with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac two years ago. John McCain fought to rein in Fannie and Freddie ... but Democrats blocked the reforms, McCain's new ad says. As evidence, the ad points to McCain's support of a bill in 2006 to strengthen oversight of Fannie and Freddie, and Democrats' opposition to that bill.Those points merit caveats, but first, some context. Fannie and Freddie, private corporations created and sponsored by Congress to lower the cost of mortgage capital, quintupled in size between 1995 and 2004, as they pioneered the practice of selling bundled mortgages in the form of securities. Federal officials in both the Bill Clinton and George W. Bush administrations sought greater authority to regulate them, but were largely stymied by Congress. In early September 2008, with home values plummeting,the government seized control of Fannie and Freddie to prevent them from failing, a move that could cost U.S. taxpayers tens of billions of dollars. McCain has taken heat for recent revelations that Freddie Mac paid a lobbying firm co-owned by his campaign manager, Rick Davis, $15,000 a month from 2005 through August 2008. But the campaign has called attention — in advertisements like this one — to McCain's support for tighter oversight of the companies. McCain did indeed co-sponsor the Federal Housing Enterprise Regulatory Reform Act of 2005, a bill that would have enhanced oversight of Freddie and Fannie. Sen. Chuck Hagel, R-Neb.,introduced the bill in January 2005 and immediately garnered co-sponsorship from two other Republican senators. McCain signed on in May 2006 after a damning federal report on accounting practices at Fannie Mae was released. If Congress does not act, American taxpayers will continue to be exposed to the enormous risk that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac pose to the housing market, the overall financial system, and the economy as a whole, he said ina statement. The National Association of Home Builders opposed the bill, as did the National Association of Realtors. Senate Democrats said they supported some form of stricter oversight, but would not support a provision of Hagel's bill that would limit the size of the company's portfolios. Negotiations stalled and the bill never made it to the floor. Does McCain's support for that bill amount to fighting to rein in Freddie and Fannie? Sort of. Others had been fighting for Fannie-and-Freddie reform for more than a decade, and McCain signed ontothe bill a year-and-a-half after it was introduced. And hereportedlydidn't do too much for the bill beyond co-sponsoring it and issuing a statement. The McCain campaign has also noted that in 2003 he was one of five Republican senators to co-sponsor a prior bill to tighten oversight of Fannie and Freddie. Still, if he fought for reform, it wasn't exactly guns-a-blazin'. Did Democrats block the reforms? More or less. They preferred a pared-down bill, and so did not support Hagel's. McCain overstates his role in pushing for Fannie and Freddie reform, and slightly oversimplifies the dynamic at work in the Senate.

Final Rating: Half True  ",Obamacare will mean 2.1 million fewer jobs by 2021.,"Opponents of the federal health care law recently got what they believe supports their argument that Congress should pull the plug on the legislation. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office projected that the law will push many Americans from the workforce. The Georgia chapter of Americans for Prosperity, a longtime critic of the law, held a rally at the state Capitol calling for the repeal of the controversial law, citing the CBOs projections. The Affordable Care Act has been disastrous for Georgians, causing premiums around the state to shoot up dramatically and causing many Georgians to lose their previous insurance. All this, despite the presidents promise that if you like your plan, you can keep it, AFP Communications Director Joel Aaron Foster said. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office says Obamacare will mean 2.1 million fewer jobs by 2021. PolitiFact Georgia wondered whether the Georgia chapter was correct in its interpretation about the potential number of jobs lost as a result of the law. Our partners at PolitiFact in Washington had looked at a similar claim and found one major flaw. The National Republican Congressional Committee claimed in a television ad that Nonpartisan government analysts say Obamacare will cost our economy up to 2.5 million jobs. PolitiFact noted that the CBO report did not use the word jobs. CBOs updated estimate of the decrease in hours worked translates to a reduction in full-time-equivalent employment of about 2.0 million in 2017, rising to about 2.5 million in 2024, compared with what would have occurred in the absence of the ACA, the CBO report said. The CBO report suggested some people will choose to work fewer hours, others may quit their jobs in order to get health care subsidies they would not receive if they continued to work their regular schedule. Because some people will reduce the amount of hours they work rather than stopping work altogether, the number who will choose to leave employment because of the ACA in 2024 is likely to be substantially less than 2.5 million, the CBO report said. PolitiFact noted: An important distinction in the report is that labor force will reduce by the equivalent of 2.5 million full-time workers over the next decade. That doesnt mean 2.5 million people will leave their jobs. Some people will only cut back a few hours or leave a second part-time job while others may stop working entirely. PolitiFact rated the National Republican Congressional Committees claim Mostly False. We contacted Americans for Prosperity Georgia to see whether there was any additional context it has that may show it should earn a better rating on the Truth-O-Meter. The groups spokesman, Foster, said the chapter stands by its statement. He pointed to other news coverage that used the same terminology to describe the conclusion the CBO reached in its report. The CBO report said the health care law will cause Americans to cut their work hours, equating to 2 million fewer jobs in 2017. That number is predicted to eventually rise to the equivalent of 2.5 million jobs in 2024, Politico reported. We found other prominent news outlets used similar language in their initial coverage. Several million American workers will reduce their hours on the job or leave the workforce entirely because of incentives built into President Barack Obama's health care overhaul, the Congressional Budget Office said Tuesday, The Associated Press reported in an article that was published in The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. That would mean losses equal to 2.3 million full-time jobs by 2021, in large part because people would opt to keep their income low to stay eligible for federal health care subsidies or Medicaid, the agency said. It had estimated previously that the law would lead to 800,000 fewer jobs by that year. Some major news outlets described it differently, sticking closer to the CBOs description of its projection. The Washington Posts Fact Checker, though, explained there is a difference. [W]e should note that the figures (2 million, etc.) are shorthand for full-time equivalent workers — a combination of two conclusions: fewer people looking for work and some people choosing to work fewer hours. The CBO added those two things and produced a hard number, but it actually does not mean 2 million fewer workers, it reported. Our conclusion We debated long and hard about this one. Americans for Prosperity Georgia did capture the general theme of what the CBO tried to say about the impact of the health care law on employment. It will result in fewer people working fewer hours. But its terminology was not entirely accurate. The CBO report did not say the health care law would result in a reduction of 2.5 million jobs. It specifically said more than 2.5 million people are likely to reduce the amount of labor they choose to supply to some degree and added that many of them will not leave the labor force entirely. We believe that is an important distinction. This claim does contain some element of truth, but some of the details are incorrect.",0.5,0.5,1.0,0.5,0.0,0.5,0.5,1.0,0.5,Half True

Final Rating: Half True",A proposed bill in the Florida Legislature would authorize the public hoarding of cats by feral cat activists.,"Florida legislators are taking up the usual public policy topics this session: health care, taxes and campaign finance reform. Then theres the bill about feral cats. Dont call them feral cats, though. Bills in the Legislature are re-branding them with a more user-friendly name: community cats. Not so fast, say the bird lovers. The American Bird Conservancy is crying fowl, er foul. The bills would authorize the public hoarding of cats by feral cat activists, in the face of potential public health and property value impacts, as well as predicted high mortality for native animals, the groups said in a press release. The conservancy says passage of two bills (HB 1121/SB 1320) would make it easier for people to dump unwanted cats in areas where they roam aplenty. This is shocking, said Grant Sizemore, the conservancys Cats Indoors program manager. Hoarding of animals in homes is prohibited in most places, but we now have Florida encouraging it in public places such as city parks. There is no question that the health of local citizenry -- including children -- is being put at risk, property values in the hoarding areas will be impacted and local wildlife will continue to be devastated. PolitiFact Florida wanted to research whether this bill would allow cat hoarding. The cat bills The Community Cats legislation, sponsored by Rep. Holly Raschein, R-Key Largo, and Sen. Darren Soto, D-Orlando, attempts to rein in cat overpopulation. Several communities have established programs to spay and care for feral cats and release them, however there were concerns among some involved in such programs that the release of cats would constitute abandonment and violate state animal cruelty laws. The bill amends the states animal cruelty law to state that someone who spays or neuters a feral cat and then releases it is not abandoning the cat or breaking the law. The bill also states that counties and cities can still adopt their own ordinances to curtail the feral cat population. The bill defines a community cat as an outdoor, free-roaming cat that lacks visible owner identification and defines a community cat owner as someone who gives that cat food or water. Cat and wildlife activists have been battling each other about how to handle feral cats for years. A 2003 Tampa Bay Times article described a cat vs. rat battle at the Ocean Reef Club, an exclusive community of multimillion-dollar homes near a state park and wildlife refuge. Homeowners set up a program to take care of hundreds of stray cats, but meanwhile the populations of the Key Largo wood rat and cotton mouse, both endangered, dwindled. Wildlife experts pointed fingers at the cats. It's a very serious problem for Key Largo wood rats, University of Florida wildlife scientist Frank Mazzotti said at the time. Releasing a feral cat in a natural area is like releasing a serial murderer in a maternity ward. Central to the bill debate is whether programs that encourage the trap, neuter and release of feral cats reduce the feral cat population and the dangers to wildlife and humans. A study by scientists including from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service estimated that cats kill up to 3.7 billion birds a year, and found no connection between the programs (called TNR) and fewer bird deaths. Claims that TNR colonies are effective in reducing cat populations, and, therefore, wildlife mortality, are not supported by peer-reviewed scientific studies, it said. A 2003 Florida International University study concluded that TNR cat programs at two parks encouraged illegal dumping of cats and led to a population increase at one park, while the other remained stable. The Florida Department of Health, which remains neutral on the cat bill, stated in a 2012 rabies prevention report that managing feral cats is not tenable on public health grounds because of the persistent threat posed to communities from injury and disease. Bill supporters point to a study published in the journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association that concluded a TNR program at the University of Central Florida reduced the population. They also point to this research about the benefits of vaccinating cats. Would this lead to hoarding? So there is evidence that feral cats carry diseases and kill wildlife. But would this bill allow animal hoarding? A spokeswoman for the Humane Society, a group supporting the bill, said bill opponents are misusing the word hoarding. Animal hoarding is a serious mental illness, Humane society spokeswoman Katie Lisnik told PolitiFact. It is a severe case of neglect and abuse of animals. Thats different from programs that care for cats, she said. Hoarding -- generally speaking, not exclusively to animals -- will be listed by the American Psychiatric Associations Diagnostic and statistical Manual for the first time this year, said Smith College psychology professor Randy Frost who studies hoarding. We asked Frost if Floridas bill could lead to increased hoarding. I dont know that there is any way to tell, he said. I think it would be hard to hoard in a field or public place. ... I dont know of many cases of hoarding where hoarding occurred in public. Id have to think about that. Brevard County recently placed a moratorium on registration for cat colonies -- county officials know of several hundred colonies. Bob Brown, captain of enforcement for Brevard County animal services, said he doesnt think he would call these cat colonies hoarding. In a cat colony, they have no control if the cat comes or goes. Usually cat hoarders want to keep things confined within their control. An outdoor colony is different than the homes where there are cat urine stains all over the walls or cat feces dripping out of cabinets. Weve seen some real doozies, he said. Robert Johns, a spokesman with the bird conservancy, said the law removes penalties for people who abandon animals to public places.  Instead of having a hoard of cats in a house, which is illegal in many places, we would simply have dozens or hundreds of them outdoors in many places, essentially taking over public land to be used by feral cats, he said. Our ruling The American Bird Conservancy said a bill would authorize the public hoarding of cats by feral cat activists. The bill would authorize people to neuter and release feral cats. But its difficult to predict how these future cat colonies will be managed and controlled by local ordinances. Is it possible that someone could hoard feral cats outdoors? Sure. But animal hoarders typically want to be able to control their cats, so thats why they hoard inside their own homes. The research we reviewed about feral cats focused on numbers, health problems and threats to wildlife they pose -- not whether it constitutes hoarding. That could be because hoarding isnt the central debate about these feral cats, but it is a heated word that draws attention.",0.5,0.5,1,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,1,0.5,Half True

Final Rating: Mostly False  ","The Obama administration ... would impose on every Catholic institution, every Jewish institution, every Protestant institution the Obamacare standard of what you have to buy as insurance.","Newt Gingrich, on the campaign trail before the Florida GOP primary, called out the Barack Obama administration for engaging in a war against religion.Federal officials' interpretation of the 2010 health care law violates religious freedom, he said.Their decision last week that they would impose on every Catholic institution, every Jewish institution, every Protestant institution the Obamacare standard of what you have to buy as insurance is a direct violation of freedom of religion, an example of the dictatorial attitude of this administration,he told voters in Jacksonville, Fla., on Jan. 30, 2012.What decision was he talking about? One about birth control. His campaign pointed us to criticism from theU.S. Conference of Catholic Bishopsof a Jan. 20 decision that ordered almost every employer and insurer in the country to provide sterilization and contraceptives, including some abortion-inducing drugs, in their health plans, according to the group.The bishops said almost every employer and insurer.We wondered, was Gingrich right that the Obama administration would impose on every Catholic institution, every Jewish institution, every Protestant institution the Obamacare standard of what you have to buy as insurance?'The Obamacare standard'The rule Gingrich was talking about, announced by Health and Human Services Department Secretary Kathleen Sebelius, addressed which preventive services must be covered by insurers without a co-pay, co-insurance or a deductible paid by the recipient of medical care.We should mention: There's not a clear Obamacare standard of what you have to buy as insurance. The law provides for co-pay-free preventive care, which is what Sebelius clarified Jan. 20. And for individual and small-group plans, the law requires that policies cover essential health benefits. They must include services in 10 categories, but the details have been left to the states.The idea of co-pay-free preventive care stems from studies that show that even moderate co-payskept women from getting care, such as mammograms or pap smears, according to HHS. The nongovernmentalInstitute of Medicinerecommended that preventive services include all FDA-approved forms of contraception. So that's what HHS decided to include in its final rule about preventive services.Most health insurance plans will have to cover them without a co-pay, co-insurance or a deductible. For most new and renewed health plans, that requirement kicks in Aug. 1, 2012. Religious exemptionsNotice we said that most health insurance plans will have to offer co-pay-free preventive care. The U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops said almost every employer and insurer.Gingrich said, every Catholic institution, every Jewish institution, every Protestant institution.But the rule provides an exemption for certain non-profit religious employersthat meet a four-part test-- essentially churches and synagogues, but also some primary and secondary religious schools.It's that definition of religious employer that has prompted theU.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, with the support of groups such as theUnion of Orthodox Jewish Congregations of America, to fight the rule. That's because it wouldn't cover religious organizations that don't primarily employ or serve people of the same religion — ruling out many universities, hospitals and charitable groups.That would require, say, a Catholic hospital to offer insurance coverage to its employees that included FDA-approved contraceptive drugs — which includes some drugs that Catholics consider abortion-inducing. Plan B and Ella prevent fertilization of an egg, prompting the FDA to categorize them as contraceptives rather than abortion-inducing drugs, but Catholics argue that Ellacan be used like the abortifacient RU-486, which isn't considered a contraceptive by the FDA.The government is giving such nonprofit religious groupsan extra yearto implement the preventive care requirements. But it won't exempt them.The decision already faceslegal challengesfrom Belmont Abbey College and Colorado Christian University.Still, if you consider a Catholic church to be a Catholic institution, or a synagogue to be a Jewish institution, Gingrich isn't correct that the recent federal rule on contraceptives applies. Those nonprofit religious employers could choose whether or not they covered contraceptive services.Our ruling Gingrich said that the Obama administration ... would impose on every Catholic institution, every Jewish institution, every Protestant institution the Obamacare standard of what you have to buy as insurance.He makes a broad statement in reference to a rule dealing specifically with co-pays for preventive care -- making it sound as though there's a blanket Obamacare standard for all insurance policies. The reality allows for states to set benchmarks for private individual and small-group plans.Meanwhile, he ignores an exemption in the federal rule for nonprofit religious employers such as churches and synagogues. That exemption has been condemned by Catholic bishops as too narrow and has been challenged in court. But it makes Gingrich's statement that the rule would impose on every ... institution inaccurate and misleading. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/dd0ecf5b-876e-4cfe-ac88-5c90949e8e9f",0.3,0.7,1.0,0.4,0.2,0.6,0.5,1.0,0.5,Mostly False

Final Rating: Mostly False","Van Jones is an avowed, self-avowed radical revolutionary communist.","Radio and TV political commentator Glenn Beck has spent weeks detailing what he says is a web of Obama administration officials with socialist or communist ties. And Exhibit A in the Beck argument has been Van Jones, Obama's so-called green jobs czar (his actual title was special adviser for green jobs at the Council on Environmental Quality). Conservative commentators and bloggers criticized Jones because of his past remarks and his involvement with controversial groups. His resignation was announced shortly after midnight on Sept. 6, 2009. Beck has repeatedly claimed Jones is a communist. For purposes of a fact-check statement, we selected a Sept. 1, 2009, remark Beck made on his radio program that Jones is an avowed, self-avowed radical revolutionary communist. There's little question that Jones  was  an avowed communist. In a Nov. 2, 2005, profile of Jones in the  East Bay Express  , an alternative weekly in Berkeley, Calif., Jones said his life hit a turning point in the spring of 1992 when he was swept up in mass arrests while protesting the acquittal of police officers accused of beating Rodney King. Although the charges against Jones were dropped, Jones said that while in jail, I met all these young radical people of color — I mean really radical, communists and anarchists. And it was, like, 'This is what I need to be a part of.' I spent the next 10 years of my life working with a lot of those people I met in jail, trying to be a revolutionary. In the months that followed, the  Express  article said, he let go of any lingering thoughts that he might fit in with the status quo. 'I was a rowdy nationalist on April 28th, and then the verdicts came down on April 29th,' he said. 'By August, I was a communist.' In 1994, the story states, Jones formed a socialist collective called Standing Together to Organize a Revolutionary Movement, or STORM. According to a history of STORM written in the spring of 2004, the group held structured political education training at every meeting to help members develop an understanding of the basics of Marxist politics. They trained members on capitalism and wage exploitation, the state and revolution, imperialism and the revolutionary party. So Jones was a self-avowed communist. But is he still? The answer lies in the very same article. Even before the group disbanded in 2002, the  Express  article says, Jones began transforming his politics and work... According to the article, He took an objective look at the movement's effectiveness and decided that the changes he was seeking were actually getting farther away. Not only did the left need to be more unified, he decided, it might also benefit from a fundamental shift in tactics. 'I realized that there are a lot of people who are capitalists — shudder, shudder — who are really committed to fairly significant change in the economy, and were having bigger impacts than me and a lot of my friends with our protest signs,' he said. In recent years, Jones established himself as a leading, charismatic cheerleader for transitioning the American economy to green jobs. We weren't able to find any recent interviews where Jones directly addresses the question of where he stands on communism. When he resigned this week, Jones said he was the victim of a vicious smear campaign by conservatives and decided to resign so as not to be a distraction. I cannot in good conscience ask my colleagues to expend precious time and energy defending or explaining my past, he said in a released statement. But check out these two statements and see if this sounds like a communist. This, from his book,  The Green Collar Economy  , released in October 2008: There will surely be an important role for nonprofit voluntary, cooperative, and community-based solutions, Jones writes on page 86. But the reality is that we are entering an era during which our very survival will demand invention and innovation on a scale never before seen in the history of human civilization. Only the business community has the requisite skills, experience, and capital to meet that need. On that score, neither the government nor the nonprofit and voluntary sectors can compete, not even remotely. So in the end, our success and survival as a species are largely and directly tied to the new eco-entrepreneurs — and the success and survival of their enterprises. Since almost all of the needed eco-technologies are likely to come from the private sector, civic leaders and voters should do all that can be done to help green business leaders succeed. That means, in large part, electing leaders who will pass bills to aid them. We cannot realistically proceed without a strong alliance between the best of the business world — and everyone else. Or how about this, from an address before the Center for American Progress on Nov. 19, 2008 (well before Jones was brought into the Obama administration): Everything that is good for the environment, everything that's needed to beat global warming, is a job, Jones said. Solar panels don't manufacture themselves. Wind turbines don't manufacture themselves. Homes don't weatherize themselves. Every single thing that we need to beat global warming will also beat the recession. And the challenge is, how do we get the government to be a smart, and limited, catalyst in getting the private sector to take on this challenge? That doesn't sound Marxist to us. Beck would have been on solid ground if he said Jones  used to be  a communist. Jones has been up front about that. But Beck has repeatedly said Jones  is  a communist. Present tense. Although we could not find a comment in which Jones explicitly said why he is no longer one, we found ample evidence that he now believes capitalism is the best force for the social change he is seeking. So there's truth to Beck's claim in that Jones  was  a communist, but it's apparent he isn't any longer, as Beck suggests. So we find the claim Barely True.  Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False. ",0.5,0.7,0.9,0.6,0.4,0.6,0.5,0.8,0.5,Mostly False

Final Rating: Mostly False",The new tax law iskicking the American economy into high gear with $5.5 trillion in tax cuts.,"In its 1600 Daily email to supporters and members of the public, the White House touted the tax bill that President Donald Trump signed in late December as a highlight of 2017. The email said that the new law would be kicking the American economy into high gear with $5.5 trillion in tax cuts, 1.7 million new jobs, and more than 60 record highs for the Dow Jones index. Heres a screenshot: That $5.5 trillion figure caught the eye of a reader, who wrote PolitiFact to note that the figure most frequently applied to the bill in news accounts is $1.5 trillion. So whats going on? When we checked into it, we found that $5.5 trillion is a misleading number because it only focuses on one side of the ledger. The law does include roughly $5.5 trillion in tax cuts over the next 10 years, which is the standard time frame for studying bills of this sort. (This just measures the cuts themselves without taking into account any possible economic growth spurred by the cuts.) However, the law also includes roughly $4 trillion in tax increases. When you add the two numbers together, the net change is roughly $1.5 trillion. So the White House is enjoying its dessert (the tax cuts) while ignoring the vegetables (the tax hikes). That provides a skewed version of the bills, tax policy experts say. Patrick Newton, a spokesman for the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, said that the $5.5 trillion figure is misleading if its the only one cited. If one figure was going to be cited, it should be the net cost of the bill — $1.5 trillion. He noted, however, that the White House did use a more accurate formulation in a more detailed web page dated Dec. 21, 2017, that explains the bills provisions. On that web page, the White House wrote that the bill provides $5.5 trillion in tax cuts but that it will also raise $4 trillion in revenue to help offset tax cuts. Our ruling Trump said the recently enacted tax law includes $5.5 trillion in tax cuts. Putting it that way ignores that the bill also includes $4 trillion in tax increases, for a net of $1.5 trillion in tax cuts.",0.5,0.7,1.0,0.4,0.3,0.6,0.5,1.0,0.6,Mostly False

Final Rating: Mostly False  ","We have towns in West Texas that are out of water, that are having to truck in water.","At a March 2015 symposium on water in Texas, the states agriculture commissioner was asked about his agencys actions in that realm. Sid Miller, a former legislator who took office in January 2015, replied that just that week hed signed off on water wells being drilled in two West Texas communities with less than 180-day water supplies. Miller, a Republican, continued: We have towns in West Texas that are out of water, that are having to truck in water. We were familiar with occasional past shortages. But is that happening again? When we requested Millers backup information, Agriculture Department spokesman Bryan Black sent us web links to news reports. One was a January 2012 NPR news report on Spicewood Beach, a Burnet County town northwest of Austin, having to truck in water. Then again, conditions there were expected to rebound, according to a June 2013 Austin American-Statesman news story, thanks to new water wells drilled near Lake Travis and a new water treatment plant. Black also pointed out a June 2013 Texas Tribune news story on the West Texas town of Barnhart, which was then out of water. To gauge Barnharts conditions of late, we reached John Nanny, an Irion County commissioner who serves on the board of the Barnhart Water Supply Corp. By phone, Nanny said drinking water last had to be trucked in during July and August 2014 — at quite a cost, he said. We cant afford to do that, he said, adding that a second well was dug, helping to shore up supplies to about 50 customers. Black didnt specify communities that had no water when Miller, um, piped up. Texas Commission on Environmental Quality Next, we reached out to the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality. By email, spokesman Terry Clawson said that as of March 12, 2015, the agency wasnt aware of any public water systems hauling in water. That said, Clawson wrote, the Berry Oaks Water Company in Comal County, between Austin and San Antonio, intermittently hauls water because of summer shortfalls. Clawson emailed us a chart indicating the water system is building a well and water plant, to be up and running, Clawson said, by mid-May 2015. Clawson said the chart represents the agencys weekly updated High Priority Water System List, which reflects water-supply conditions self-reported to the commission — meaning it shouldnt be read as all-inclusive. There may be systems that have either not reported their status or are not aware of their conditions, Clawson said. In a follow-up note, Clawson specified 11 public water systems previously reported as having to haul (or truck) in drinking water due to persistent drought. He attached a chart describing each instance. In another email, Black mentioned most of the same systems. The commission chart listed five water systems located somewhere on the vast west side of Texas, specifically ones in Burnet County, northwest of Austin; Barnhart in Irion County, west of San Angelo; Medina County, west of San Antonio; Hood County, southwest of Fort Worth; and Tom Green County, whose county seat is San Angelo. Then again, in each event, according to the chart, the Texas Department of Agriculture or the water system itself funded improvements restoring supply. Our ruling Miller said: We have towns in West Texas that are out of water. In recent years, towns around Texas occasionally ran dry until new wells or water plants met needs. But Miller named no towns out of water of late nor did we identify any. MOSTLY FALSE – The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.

Kay Hagan voted to kill the equivalent of 2.5 million jobs.","In the second North Carolina Senate debate between Democratic incumbent Kay Hagan and Republican Thom Tillis, the challenger reached deep into the GOP playbook for an attack line about President Barack Obamas health care law and its potential impact on jobs. Sen. Hagans solution is spending more money, Tillis said. Its very simple. Government needs to get out of the way. We need to get our spending under control, and we need to reduce regulations. Sen. Hagan, when she cast the deciding vote for Obamacare, voted to kill the equivalent of 2.5 million jobs. Critics of the health care law have long argued that the new regulations it created, particularly those on businesses, would hamper employment -- or, in the more explosive language of the campaign trail, that it would be a job killer. The critics got what seemed to be a boost when the Congressional Budget Office -- Congress nonpartisan numbers-cruncher -- produced a report on this topic in February 2014. The CBO projected that by 2017, there would be the equivalent of about 2 million fewer workers than there would be in the absence of the law. CBO said that number would grow to about 2.5 million by 2024. However, most of the laws critics glossed over some critical facts when citing these numbers. Why kill is the wrong word The biggest problem with Tillis characterization of the CBOs findings is that he used the word kill. This is inaccurate because it suggests that employers will be making 2.5 million layoffs, or because businesses arent going to be creating that many jobs. That's not what the report said; rather, the reduction will come primarily from voluntary choices by workers, not by employers. The CBO figured that, when presented with new options for purchasing health insurance outside their job, millions of people would decide they dont need to work as much. The report estimated that Obamacare would reduce the total number of hours worked, on net, by about 1.5 percent to 2.0 percent during the period from 2017 to 2024, almost entirely because workers will choose to supply less labor -- given the new taxes and other incentives they will face and the financial benefits some will receive. This would equal a decline in the number of full-time-equivalent workers of about 2 million in 2017, rising to about 2.5 million in 2024, it continued. These changes, CBO said, would not result in an increase in unemployment (that is, more workers seeking but not finding jobs) or underemployment (such as part-time workers who would prefer to work more hours per week). To be clear, the report predicts that total employment will still rise. It just wont rise as much as it would if the health care law did not exist. We should note that the report did have some less sanguine observations about the health care laws impact on employment. As more people choose to work less, the CBO concluded, the labor force participation rate should decline, putting a larger burden for supporting the social safety net on those who remain working. Any change in labor force participation comes on top of an already major shift toward retirement driven by the aging of the baby boom. In addition, some commentators have expressed concern about having people work less because taxpayer-subsidized insurance is available. Ultimately, it boils down to a tradeoff, Tara Sinclair, a George Washington University economist, told PolitiFact earlier this year. Admittedly there are some touchy issues with the government potentially paying or subsidizing the health care costs for people who could work but choose not to, Sinclair said. But overall I think separating health care from employment, at least making it like any other service where employment may provide the money to pay for it but where we work doesn't determine our choices, is a good thing. To his credit, Tillis -- unlike many of his Republican colleagues -- was able to avoid one linguistic pitfall. Tillis framed the CBOs findings as projecting a reduction in the equivalent of 2.5 million jobs, rather than simply saying a reduction of 2.5 million jobs. Thats an important distinction because the CBO didnt cite the number of jobs that will be reduced; rather, it referred to full-time-equivalents of jobs. That may seem deep in the weeds, but its worth noting. These job equivalents will be made up of lots of bits and pieces of hours per week that people will choose to drop. For instance, some of these people might be working two or three jobs, in excess of 40 hours a week, and will choose to cut back to a more reasonable one or two jobs. A final note: Were also not wild about Tillis characterization of Hagan casting the deciding vote for Obamacare. In most cases when weve looked at that claim, we have rated them Mostly False, since any one of the 60 Senate supporters could have been described as having cast the deciding vote. But for the sake of simplicity, we will only consider the employment question in putting this claim to the Truth-O-Meter. Our ruling In the debate, Tillis said that, by voting for Obamacare, Sen. Kay Hagan voted to kill the equivalent of 2.5 million jobs. The main problem with this claim is that Tillis used the word kill. This mischaracterizes what is going on, since the reduction will come from voluntary actions by workers, rather than layoffs by employers. Indeed, the CBO said the law would not push up unemployment.",0.5,0.8,1.0,0.6,0.4,0.7,0.5,1.0,0.3,Mostly False

Final Rating: Mostly False  ",Says U.S. Senate candidate Eric Hovde has no problem with raising taxes.,"Trying to boost Republican Mark Neumanns bid for U.S. Senate, a national conservative group is blasting away at Neumann rivals Tommy Thompson and Eric Hovde.The message: Both are big taxers.The national Club for Growth, which has endorsed Neumann, uses a widely aired TV ad to highlight nine instances of tax increases during Tommy Thompsons 14 years as Wisconsin governor -- years marked, as we found in rating a Thompson claim Mostly True, by a decline in the overall tax burden.The group had a much smaller record to comb through on Hovde, a banker and investment-fund manager and first-time candidate.In a national TV interview, Hovde said he had no problem with raising taxes, the ad says. And Hovde supported tax-raising Gov. Jim Doyle. On taxes, Hovdes like Thompson, only worse.The ad shows a smiling Hovde at the start of a 2009 TV appearance as a financial pundit on CNBCs Squawk Box beneath the words: No Problem Raising Taxes.Hovde fired back with his own TV spot that calls the Neumann (actually Club for Growths) tax accusation false. (The campaign acknowledges Hovde gave $500 to Democrat Doyles re-election campaign in 2005. It has not explained why, but notes that Hovde has given almost exclusively to Republicans, and in much larger amounts.)So, did Hovdes remarks suggest he has no problem with raising taxes?We watched the nearly 11-minute discussion between Hovde and the cable shows hosts and found a brief exchange on taxes that closely -- but not exactly -- mirrors the language in the groups ad.The backgroundHovdes March 3, 2009 appearance on CNBC focused on the ongoing financial crisis and his criticisms of actions under both Republican President George W. Bush and newly elected President Barack Obama. Hovde said the country was in a depression, Obamas stimulus bill was unfocused and out of control federal spending was taking the country into quasi-Socialist territory.At the 7:25 mark of the segment, as the Journal Sentinels Dan Bice reported in April 2012, Hovde abruptly turned the talk to taxes, tax breaks and the Obama administration.Unprompted, he began: Look, I have no problem with me getting charged higher taxes. Ive been blessed in my life and Ive been very fortunate. But some of the things that theyve done are just insane.Then he referred to an Obama 2009 proposal to reduce the mortgage-interest tax deduction for households earning more than $250,000.Taking away deductions on home mortgage payments -- I dont need it, but a lot of other people do. Hovde said. Were in a housing recession -- are you kidding me?So, the Club for Growth claims Hovde said he had no problem with raising taxes. He actually said: I have no problem with me getting charged higher taxes.Thats a significant difference, especially since he immediately noted that eliminating housing deductions, for instance, would be unwise in a recession.The timing is also important.In 2009, Hovde was a private citizen, not a candidate running on a platform of what he would do if elected.An candidate can have a personal opinion on an issue but may decide to vote another way for a variety of reasons. For instance, a lawmaker personally would not seek an abortion but votes pro-choice to leave the decision up to the mother.Its also unclear from the 2009 CNBC interview exactly what Hovde was talking about. Did he mean paying more through a higher top tax rate? Through a repeal of the Bush tax cuts?When asked about the claim, the Club for Growth noted it would take a tax increase of some kind for Hovdes personal tax bill to rise.As a candidate in 2012, Hovde told Bice he was not referring to Obamas so-called Buffett Rule legislation to make sure high earners pay at least 30 percent in federal income tax (a bill sponsored by U.S. Rep. Tammy Baldwin, the Democratic candidate in the race).Hovde has said he was thinking of the tax break on carried interest -- the portion of a funds investment gains taken by fund managers (like Hovde) as compensation. It also applies to venture capitalists and private equity specialists.In an interview, Hovde agreed that it would be a tax increase for that narrow group. Some government estimates put the total at more than $1 billion a year.But lets look at his tax positions as a candidate in 2012.Hovde has pledged to reduce individual income tax rates across the board, drop the corporate income tax rate from 35 percent to 25 percent and eliminate the estate tax.So Hovde has made it clear he is against raising tax rates. In fact, he wants dramatic cuts in peoples tax bills.That leaves his support for eliminating tax deductions -- a move that would bring the government more revenue.Hovde says he would vote to eliminate nearly all of the deductions in the current tax code, which he sees as riddled with favors to big corporations at the expense of small businesses. He also thinks the individual tax code is too complicated.And he told us he still favors eliminating the carried interest tax provision, which he sees as eliminating a loophole.Hovde, who has made debt and deficit reduction a major theme, has told voters he would accept a budget-balancing deal that gets $10 in spending cuts for every $1 in new revenue through the elimination of loopholes or deductions.He told us his strong preference would be that such a deal include cuts in the tax rates.He said he would consider supporting a 10-to-1 deal that holds rates steady instead of lowering them, depending on which loopholes or deductions are removed.But does that constitute a tax increase?Even conservative Republicans disagree on this. Americans for Tax Reforms widely publicized taxpayer protection pledge frowns on deduction eliminations unless the new revenue is completely offset by lower rates. Thompson and Neumann have signed that pledge, but Hovde has not. A leading conservative in the Senate, Republican Tom Coburn of Oklahoma, has criticized the groups pledge as too narrow to allow for smart reform of the tax code.PolitiFact National consulted a range of experts in January 2012 in evaluating a Mitt Romney claim that Obama has raised taxes 19 times.Views differed on some issues, but the consensus was that eliminating or limiting such deductions as those for prescription or other medical expenses clearly deserved the label of tax increases.Donald Marron, director of the Tax Policy Center, told us its case by case -- some of these tax preferences are best seen as taxes, but others as spending programs in disguise.Given Hovdes pledge to wipe out nearly all deductions, it seems clear that some of those moves could be labeled as tax increases. Even Hovde acknowledged eliminating the carried interest provision would be a tax increase for a narrow group.Our conclusionThe national Club for Growth used Hovdes own words from a cable TV interview in 2009 to frame him as in favor of raising taxes.Hovde said what he said -- he would pay more, which put him on record as open to some kind of tax increase. Theres no other way to read it.But the ad takes the 2009 comment and alters it in a subtle but significant way, changing the context. By also changing the timing, leaving viewers thinking Hovde is campaigning in 2012 on a plan to raise taxes, the issue is further distorted.In the current campaign, Hovde has made it clear he wants dramatically lower taxes and would not raise rates, while staying open to a net revenue increase from loophole elimination as part of a massive spending-and-tax-cut deal. That doesnt square with the breezy portrayal of Hovde as having no problem raising taxes.The Truth-O-Meter says Mostly False claims have an element of truth but ignore critical facts that would give a different impression.We think that fits the Club for Growth ad claim.

Final Rating: Mostly False  ",The director of the FBI said that we cannot properly vet people coming from the Middle East.,"Bradenton developer Carlos Beruff wants voters to know that he plans to be tough on national security and immigration, because right now the FBI has no way to guarantee Americas safety as refugees flood the United States. Thousands of Syrian refugees are pouring into our country, thanks to President Obama, Beruff said in an Aug. 8 Facebook post. This is an open invitation to acts of terror. Even the director of the FBI said that we cannot properly vet people coming from the Middle East. Immigration has been a major focus of this election cycle, with Republicans routinely calling for more restrictions to ensure security in the United States. But did James Comey actually say the FBI cannot properly vet people coming from the Middle East? No, he didnt. Beruff is distorting a point Comey was making about a flaw in the vetting process, but he was reiterating the system in place was actually much better than it had been in years past. No guarantees When we asked Beruffs campaign what Comey said and when, his spokesman sent us a YouTube clip of Comey speaking before the House Homeland Security Committee on Oct. 21, 2015. A topic at the meeting was the thoroughness of background checks for refugees — specifically some 10,000 Syrian refugees slated to come to the United States. The Syrian refugee focus was much more specific than people coming from the Middle East, as Beruff said. Lets be clear: The United States can vet refugees through a process that involves the FBI, plus the State Department, the Department of Homeland Security, the Department of Defense and other agencies. The vetting process can take two or even three years, in which refugees undergo several rounds of security clearance checks. Because of the overt concern about terrorism, Syrian refugees actually have to go through extra hurdles. Experts have told us repeatedly that refugee background checks are the most extensive security screening the country has for any type of visitor. At the committee meeting, U.S. Rep. Bennie Thompson, D-Miss., asked Comey if there was concern that the FBI could miss a potential terrorist infiltrator because intelligence databases may not contain complete information on every refugee. Comey agreed, saying the procedure isnt perfect, because it relies on checking for criminal records or other nefarious activity. We can only query against that which we have collected, Comey said. If someone has never made a ripple in the pond in Syria in a way that would get their identity or their interest reflected in our database, we can query our database until the cows come home but we are not going to — there will be nothing show up because we have no record on that person. So while the process is very thorough, Comey was saying he couldnt guarantee there would never be a problem and no terrorist could ever slip through the cracks. Thats just the way it is. Comey noted that when the United States performed background checks on Iraqi refugees, they had a much larger database because of the American presence there over the last decade. Not having the same intelligence infrastructure in Syria has resulted in much less information with which to cross-reference an applicant. As Secretary of Homeland Security,Jeh Johnson said during the same hearing that a refugee may have a criminal past thats unknown, or may suddenly commit a terrorist act after entering the United States. But even with the pitfalls of admitting refugees from war-torn regions, Comey said, the process works and has been improving over the years. The good news is we are much better doing it than eight years ago, Comey told U.S. Rep Jeff Duncan, R-S.C., later in the hearing. The bad news is, there is no risk-free process. Comey was echoing concerns he voiced to the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee on Oct. 8. There is risk associated with bringing anybody in from the outside, but especially from a conflict zone like that, he told the Senate committee. From the intelligence community's perspective, as I said, I think we've developed an effective way to touch all of our databases and resources to figure out what we know about individuals.  I don't think that's a cumbersome process. My concern there is that there are certain gaps. He repeated that sentiment to the House Judiciary Committee on Oct. 22. We have gotten much better as an intelligence community at joining our efforts and checking our databases in a way that gives us high confidence. If we have a record on somebody, it will surface. That's the good news, Comey said. The challenge we face with Syria is that we don't have that rich set of data. So even though we've gotten better at querying what we have, we certainly will have less overall. And so as I said to a question earlier, someone only alerts as a result of our searches if we have some record on them. That's the challenge we face with Syria. Our ruling Beruff said, The director of the FBI said that we cannot properly vet people coming from the Middle East. Comey, while talking specifically about Syrian refugees and not all of the Middle East, has repeatedly said that admitting refugees has its challenges and that information gaps do exist. But he also has expressed confidence in the admission procedure and says it continues to improve. That makes it hard to argue Comey feels like the governments process cannot properly vet people.",0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,Mostly False

Final Rating: Mostly False",There was just about zero press coverage of the 2007 Bush White House email controversy.,"Why is everyone picking on Hillary Clinton -- they didnt mind when President George W. Bushs White House also used private email, pundit Juan Williams asked on Fox News Sunday. The shows March 15, 2015, pundit panel debated the importance of the ongoing controversy regarding Clintons decision to exclusively use a private email account, rather than a .gov account, during her time as secretary of state. In doing so, experts say she was able to circumvent transparency and records preservation standards. Williams turned to his fellow commentator, Republican strategist and former Bush adviser Karl Rove, arguing that the email scandal during the Bush administration didnt garner the same level of media criticism. Thus, the attention on Clinton is unwarranted. When Karl was in trouble back in 07, (there was) no press coverage, just about zero press coverage of this issue, Williams said, noting that he found just one Washington Post editorial criticizing the private email use. Juan, you are in a different reality, and I wish that I was there with you, Rove said. We decided to look back and see what press coverage of the Bush administration email controversy looked like at the timeand how it compares to coverage of Clinton. The Bush email story First, a quick refresher about what happened in the Bush administration. In March 2007, eyes were on then-Attorney General Alberto Gonzales after the administration unexpectedly fired eight U.S.attorneys. Congress (recently taken over by Democrats) investigated the firings, alleging that the administration had dropped the prosecutors for political reasons. Over the course of the investigation, it came out that some White House officials had conducted White House business over private email accountsset up on a server through the Republican National Committee. The White House later admitted that some internal White House emails conducted on the RNC server might have been lost. Democrats in Congress accused the administration of purposefully circumventing recordkeeping processes, while the White House said staffers were supposed to use the RNC emails solely for political affairs, not official business. Comparing the Bush and Clinton email scandals is not exactly apples to apples, but there are some similarities. We looked back at media coverage at the time, and Williams has a point that it didnt cause the same level of hubbub as the Clinton email scandal. Though to say there was zero press coverage is an exaggeration -- even allowing for a bit of hyperbole. Comparing the coverage We did a search through Lexis-Nexis, a research service that tracks news articles and transcripts, between March and May 2007. We found more than 125 transcripts from the major cable networks and National Public Radio that include Republican National Committee and email within 10 words of each other. The Lexis-Nexis search also yielded more than 200 related newspaper articles across the country within the same time frame. Lets compare that to coverage of the Clinton controversy. Since the story broke March 3, 2015 -- two weeks ago -- we found 204 cable and public radio transcripts that include Clinton and email. We also found 1,700 newspaper articles across the country. Thats several times as many articles and transcripts about Clinton than there were about the Bush email controversy in a quarter of the time. Its a rough measurement, but clearly there has been more media attention on Clintons use of private email than that of the White House staffers. What about Williams reference to the singular Washington Post editorial criticizing the private email use among White House staffers? We found the one editorial, as well as a couple opinion columns. In comparison, the Washington Post has so far written two editorials regarding Clintons private email use. Not the same Williams argument is that Republicans are stoking the media fire of the Clinton email scandal because theyre worried about Clintons 2016 potential, compared to Republican candidates. Theres some nuances and contextual factors that might explain the difference in media coverage. First of all, theres the difference in whos at the receiving end of the criticisms. In 2007, it was a group of higher-up White House staffers and advisers (notably Rove) who occasionally used private email accounts for official business. As far as we can tell, though, Bush himself was not suspected as being part of this group. Today, the target is a former secretary of state, who only used private email when conducting official government business. Whats more is that Clinton is in all likelihood running for president in 2016, so she has a lot of media attention on her to begin with. At the time of their email controversy, the Bush administration was past their 2004 second-term election and the 2006 midterms. Additionally, the White House email controversy was on the periphery of a much larger scandal -- the firings of the eight U.S. attorneys. We searched Lexis-Nexis for articles about Attorney General Gonzales in the same time frame that we used to explore coverage of the White House email controversy. The search came up with more than 6,000 combined newspaper articles and transcripts. (Compared to the more than 325 about the emails). As oneWashington Post article put it: The controversy over the outside e-mail accounts is a byproduct of the ongoing showdown over the prosecutor firings. Our ruling Williams said there was just about zero press coverage of the 2007 Bush White House email controversy. We emailed Williams and did not hear back. Saying there was zero press coverage is an exaggeration --even allowing for a bit of hyperbole. We found hundreds of articles and television transcripts referencing the issue. Still, Williams has something of a point that compared to the extensive recent coverage of Clintons use of private email, media coverage of the 2007 Bush White House email controversy was thin. Williams statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.",0.2,0.7,0.8,0.3,0.2,0.5,0.4,0.9,0.5,Mostly False

Final Rating: Mostly False  ",Says U.S. greenhouse gas emissions are at 20-year lows.,"As President Barack Obama brought up his interest in addressing global warming, a Texas congressman said U.S. emissions of greenhouse gases, widely believed to be fueling climate change, are on the decline.  DID YOU KNOW? Rep. Joe Barton, R-Arlington, wrote on Twitter during Obamas Feb. 12, 2013, State of the Union address. U.S. GHG emissions are at 20-year lows while global emissions are rising.   Global emissions have been on the upswing. The Environmental Protection Agency says on a web page that global carbon emissions from the burning of fossil fuels increased by over 16 times between 1900 and 2008 and by about 1.5 times between 1990 and 2008. Separately, the governments Carbon Dioxide Information Analysis Center contributed to a December 2012 discussion paper stating that in 2011, estimated global carbon dioxide emissions due to burning fossil fuels and making cement were up 3 percent from 2010.   We checked on Bartons claim that domestic greenhouse gas emissions are at a 20-year low.   By email, Barton spokesman Sean Brown pointed out an August 2012 web post by the U.S. Energy Information Administration stating that estimated U.S. carbon dioxide emissions resulting from energy use during the first three months of 2012 were the lowest in two decades for any January-March period. Brown also noted the Environmental Protection Agency saying in an online chart that as of 2010, concentrations of five common air pollutants--carbon monoxide, ozone, lead, nitrogen dioxide and sulfur dioxide--had decreased from 30 years earlier.   This information did not speak to all greenhouse gases, as Barton had, but carbon dioxide from burning fossil fuels is the largest contributor to greenhouse gas emissions.   Perry Lindstrom, an economist with the Energy Information Administration, emailed us a spreadsheet indicating that the nations energy-related carbon dioxide emissions were estimated at 1,339 million metric tons in the first quarter of 1992 and at a slightly higher amount, 1,344 million metric tons, for the comparable months of 2012. In the intervening years, first-quarter emissions topped out at 1,580 million metric tons in 2004 and bottomed out at 1,364 million metric tons in 1993, according to the spreadsheet.   Then again, the first quarter of 2012 was unusual, the agency said in its post. Normally, the agency wrote, carbon dioxide emissions during the year are highest in the first quarter because of strong demand for heat produced by fossil fuels. But such emissions were lower at the start of 2012 thanks to a mild winter, which reduced heating demand and energy use, the agency said, with other factors including a decline in coal-fired electricity generation, due largely to low natural gas prices, and reduced gasoline demand.   Still, the 2012 first-quarter emissions were lower than they had been in the first part of the year in 19 years. However, Lindstrom said by telephone, he would hesitate to reach conclusions solely by comparing emissions in part of a year to emissions in part of another year in contrast to looking, say, decade to decade. At our request, he provided a spreadsheet comparing energy-related carbon dioxide emissions for the 10 months through October 2012 to such emissions over the comparable part of each previous year over two decades. Our thinking was that this would deliver a longer view based on the latest information available when Barton tweeted. And according to this spreadsheet, the estimated emissions from January through October 2012, 4,386 metric tons, were the lowest 10-month total since 1995--17 years earlier--when such emissions totaled 4,385 metric tons.   Going forward, Lindstrom pointed out, his agency projects U.S. energy-related carbon dioxide emissions to remain below 2005 levels through 2040. Jim Butler, director of global monitoring at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administrations Earth System Research Laboratory, said by phone that such levelling out makes sense due to improvements in energy efficiency and shifts to fuel sources with less of a carbon footprint than coal.   Mindful that Bartons tweet said greenhouse gas emissions were at a 20-year low, we looked next at emissions of methane, nitrous dioxide, sulfur dioxide, hydrofluorocarbons, perfluorocarbons and sulfur hexafluoride as estimated in the Environmental Protection Agencys April 2012 inventory of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions--the latest inventory that would have been available when Barton tweeted. (The agencys 2013 draft inventory was posted online Feb. 22, 2013.)   The 2012 inventory indicates that total emissions of three gases were higher in 2010 than 1990, while emissions of four others were lower.   In keeping with Bartons 20-year window, we used the inventory figures to gauge the difference between estimated emissions of each greenhouse gas in 2010 and 1990:   --Carbon dioxide emissions in 2010 were 12 percent greater than in 1990;  --Methane emissions were lower by 0.3 percent; --Nitrous oxide emissions were lower by 3 percent; --Hydrofluorocarbon emissions were higher by more than 200 percent; --Perfluorocarbons were lower by 73 percent; --Sulfur hexafluoride emissions were lower by 57 percent.  Taking all the greenhouse gases into account, according to the inventory, overall emissions were 11 percent higher in 2010 than 1990--and also up 3 percent from 2009, when total emissions dipped considerably during the national recession. Aside from 2009, the previous year with lower greenhouse gas emissions than 2010 was 1997, according to the inventory.   Our ruling   The congressman said domestic greenhouse gas emissions are at a 20-year low.   This statement depends on a comparison of energy-related carbon dioxide emissions—not all greenhouse gases--over three unusually warm winter months of 2012 to such emissions in the same months of 1992. But the latest information available when Barton tweeted indicates that total U.S. greenhouse gas emissions were higher in 2010 than they were 20 years earlier, though the 2010 emissions were lower than they were 13 years earlier.   CORRECTION, 10:42 a.m. April 8, 2013: Thanks to a reader's nudge, this story was amended to say that the discussed levels of carbon dioxide were in millions of metric tons, not metric tons alone. This did not affect our original rating of the claim.",0.3,0.7,1.0,0.4,0.0,0.5,0.5,0.6,0.5,Mostly False

Bill Nelson as a politician who has gotten out of paying property taxes.After 40 years in politics, Bill Nelson has learned how to milk the system. He leased land that he owned for six cows, taking advantage of an agricultural tax loophole to dodge $43,000 in taxes just last year, the narrator says. Then he sold the land for home development, pocketing at least $1.4 million.The kicker: Tax breaks and big profits for him, higher taxes for the rest of us. Here, we will look at whether he sold the land for home development for at least $1.4 million.The greenbelt exemptionAs evidence for the ad, Crossroads spokesman Nate Hodson referred us to a February 2012 Tampa Bay Timesstory that scrutinized Nelsons qualifications for a greenbelt assessment, which spares him from paying higher taxes on his familys 55-acre pasture along the Indian River. Instead of paying taxes on the market value, his tax bill is based on a much lower agricultural assessment.Nelson gets the greenbelt assessment for his Brevard County pasture because he leases the land to a small-time cattle owner. The current lessee, cattleman Jeff Darby, has a herd of about six cows and uses the land free of charge, though he is tasked with maintenance.The greenbelt law was enacted in 1959 as a financial incentive for farmers to keep their land as developers bought up farm land for malls, highways and homes.Without the lower agricultural rate, Nelson would have paid about $43,000 in higher taxes on the land.The ad gives voters the impression that Nelson parked some cows on land to save money on his taxes and then axed the cows in a land sale to developers. (The ad sends the cows flying with the arrival of a new brick house from the sky.)Such a move obviously goes against the spirit of the greenbelt law, though its legal, and it happens. The problem with the greenbelt law, critics say, is that its written too broadly. Under the law, county property appraisers are tasked with determining if the land is used primarily for bona fide agricultural purposes.The Brevard County property appraisers office has tried to remove Nelsons greenbelt designation in the past, but Nelson fought to keep it and won in court. (An inspector in 1999 went to his property and found no cows; Nelson argued they escaped via a hole in the fence.)Nelsons land salesThe ad leaves out a lot of important context about that $1.4 million profit that Nelson supposedly gained from land sales.When Nelson moved to Tallahassee in the mid 90s to serve on the state Cabinet, he sold the main house that he lived in, which is adjacent to the pasture.He sold four more nearby lots after he moved to Washington, D.C., to serve as a U.S. senator. Two of these were residential lots that had houses on them. Two more were lots that he cut out of his pastureland, so those had used the greenbelt exemption. The total for these four transactions to private homeowners is at least $1.4 million, the Times reported. Floridas greenbelt law does not require him to pay back part of his tax break.Nelsons campaign does not dispute the $1.4 million total -- they do dispute how American Crossroads presented the transactions. That total does not represent all of the money he received from the agricultural lots; it also includes the sales of two residential lots.The ad is leading viewers to equate the land that got the tax break with the land he sold for $1.4 million, and thats plainly wrong. Nelson did not sell the entire pasture. The cows still graze on it, and Nelson has indicated that will not change for the land his family has had since 1924.I've looked at all the options on the rest of the property and I've decided not to develop it. I want to leave it to my kids, Nelson told the Times in February.Our rulingIts not fully accurate for Crossroads to say Nelson took land that was receiving agricultural tax breaks and sold it for home development at a profit of $1.4 million. For one, the land that earned the tax break -- a 55-acre pasture -- is still a pasture. He did not sell that land for home development.Nelson has sold two agricultural lots, but those sales do not total $1.4 million. To get there, you have to factor in two more sales of residential lots adjoining the pasture. Those lots already had homes on them when Nelson sold them.American Crossroads is cherry-picking a figure from the Times story to incite anger against Nelsons tax break without telling the entire story.",0.2,0.8,0.9,0.5,0.3,0.7,0.6,0.9,0.4,Mostly False

Final Rating: Mostly False  ","Says Joe Biden said voting by mail is a way to fundamentally change this country, contradicting past statements by Barack Obama and Debbie Wasserman Schultz.","A new video launched by the Republican National Committee suggests Democrats are pushing a radical plan to change our elections through widespread mail-in voting. This is a radical change from their past, the video says. As evidence, it flashes to clips of comments by President Barack Obama, U.S. Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, D-Fla., and former U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder that are divorced from any context. The one-minute video plays snippets of journalists bashing Iowa Democrats over their bungled caucus in February before ending with a warning: Democrats couldnt run the Iowa Caucus. Dont let them redesign our entire election. The RNC launched its Protect the Vote website May 8, vowing to fight the Democrats assault on the integrity of our elections. But the clips of Democratic leaders are removed from the context of what they were talking about and ignore Obamas support for voting by mail in general at the time. The video also wrongly portrays the push for more mail-in voting as solely a Democratic effort. While Democratic leaders have pushed for more mail-in voting, they arent alone. Republican officeholders in at least 16 states that do not have all-mail elections were encouraging voters to cast ballots via mail. The RNCs former chairman in March called for conservatives to embrace broader use of voting by mail. RELATED: Donald Trumps dubious claim that 'thousands' are conspiring on mail-ballot fraud The ad starts with a clip of presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden stating, We have an incredible opportunity to not just dig out of this crisis but to fundamentally change this country. The text on the screen says, Democrats have a radical plan to change our elections. But Bidens statement was about protecting essential workers, not voting by mail or in person. He used a May 4 campaign event to talk about providing a livable wage and paid sick leave to workers including meat packers and grocery store clerks. Bidens campaign has said he wants safer options for voting, including voting by mail and in-person voting. At a virtual fundraiser in April, Biden told donors that we have to make it easier for everyone to vote if we are still in lockdown, including providing mail-in ballots. At a virtual fundraiser May 8, Biden praised a move by California Gov. Gavin Newsom to send a mail-in ballot to every voter. The video shows MSNBCs Chris Matthews asking Obama a question related to mail-in voting. They are talking about people mailing in their ballots. Do you trust the security, the honesty of such an election process? Matthews asked. Obama responded: Well, Id think we would have to figure out whether this was fraud-proof. The video doesnt clearly show the context of the interview; faint text on the screen says Decision 08. It would be possible for viewers to assume Obama was criticizing voting by mail in general, but Obama was commenting about a specific set of circumstances related to the presidential primary in Florida. In 2007, the Florida Legislature moved up the date of the presidential primary to Jan. 29, earlier than either national party permitted. Hillary Clinton beat Obama, but the Democratic National Committee determined that the election violated party rules and stripped the state of its delegates. In March 2008, some Florida Democrats proposed a do-over election including a scenario of entirely voting by mail. Here was Matthews full question on March 11, 2008, to then-Sen. Obama: Theres word from Florida that they intend to put out a mailing sort of a campaign — I mean, an election process, whereby they make up for the primary they had before, which was ruled out of order by the Democratic National Committee and you did not campaign in. Theyre talking about mailing it — people mailing in their ballots. Do you trust the security, the honesty of such an election process? The RNC video only included the first sentence of Obamas cautious response. But Obama then made some positive statements about voting by mail: I mean, Oregon, for example, has a terrific mail-in system, but theyve already scanned everybodys signatures whos registered to vote so that they can check to make sure that in fact the right people are voting. And thats something that I think youd have to figure out. During the 2020 pandemic, Obama has not expressly called for only voting by mail. He called for safe voting options while tweeting a New York Times story that debunked the claim that absentee voting favors Democrats and an NPR story about proposals to expand voting by mail and early voting. The clip in the video of Wasserman Schultz does not clearly show the context. The text on the screen reads postal primary do-over — but its difficult to decipher. Debbie Wasserman Schultz argues a mail-in ballot has wrong written all over it, a journalist says. The video then shows a clip of Wasserman Schultz, a Broward Democrat, stating: It would be a risky experiment for us with an election that has stakes as high as a presidential election does. The RNC video omits her next sentence: We've never done a mail-in ballot statewide. She also said that there's a way to solve this without totally redoing this and causing more chaos. Those clips are from a CNN report on March 10, 2008, about the idea for a mail-in primary do-over. Wasserman Schultz was talking about voting by mail in the narrow context of the proposed re-do election that spring. After months of wrangling that spring, the DNC agreed that Florida could send a full delegation to the convention, but each delegate would only get half a vote. Amid the pandemic, Wasserman Schultz said she supports expanding early voting and vote by mail options. The video also includes a quote by Eric Holder, a former Attorney General under Obama. No form of electoral fraud ever has been or will ever be tolerated by this administration, Holder said. That stems from a speech he gave about voting rights in 2012; he wasnt specifically talking about absentee ballot fraud. An RNC video says Joe Biden said voting by mail is a way to fundamentally change this country, contradicting past statements by Barack Obama and Debbie Wasserman Schultz. The RNC video only includes snippets of statements by Obama and Wasserman Schultz to leave viewers with a misleading impression that they were bashing voting by mail in general, and that wasnt the case. Obama and Wasserman Schultz were talking about voting by mail in a narrow set of circumstances: a controversial proposal to redo the presidential preference primary in Florida in 2008. There is no evidence that overall either Democrat was broadly critical of voting by mail as an option in elections. The portion of the video about Biden also omits context. The video quotes him stating we have an incredible opportunity to not just dig out of this crisis but to fundamentally change this country, before launching into the videos theme that Democrats want to use mail-in balloting to radically change American elections. But Biden wasnt talking about elections, he was talking about protecting workers amid the pandemic. This video includes actual quotes by these three Democrats, but lacks context to explain their remarks. This video rates Mostly False.

Final Rating: Mostly False  ",Small businesses in West Virginia make up about 96 percent of our state's economy.,"Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., recently cheerleaded West Virginia small businesses in a tweet from his Senate account. Manchin tweeted, Did you know #WV has more than 120k small businesses & they make up about 96% of our state's economy? Remember this & #shopsmall #WVSBDC #SBDCday Did you know #WV has more than 120k small businesses & they make up about 96% of our state's economy? Remember this & #shopsmall #WVSBDC #SBDCday We were surprised that small companies comprise 96 percent of West Virginias economy, so we took a closer look. As it turns out, Manchin used the wrong terminology, ultimately making his claim incorrect. We turned to data from the federal Small Business Administration, which offers fact sheets about small businesses in every state. Manchins in the ballpark for the number of small businesses in the state. The SBA counts 115,673 small businesses, a number that is apt to fluctuate regularly, as companies start up and go out of business. (The agencys definition of a small business is one with fewer than 500 employees.) And the fact sheet has a number close to the 96 percent figure Manchin cited. The SBA says that 98.9 percent of West Virginias businesses are small businesses. But that does not support what Manchin said. Saying that almost 99 percent of West Virginia's businesses are small firms is not what economists refer to as a percentage of the economy. That term refers to the percentage of all economic output, which is sometimes called state-level gross domestic product. The fact sheet doesnt provide small business output as a percentage of the economy, but its certainly well below 96 percent. Why? Because while small businesses account for nearly 99 percent of employers in the state, they only account for about half —50.1 percent — of West Virginia employees. So it isnot credible to say that half of the workforce produces 96 percent of the output while the other half — the big-company workforce —produces just 4 percent of output. In fact, it wouldnt be surprising if the half of West Virginia employees working for big companies account for more than half of economic output, said Gary Burtless, an economist with the Brookings Institution. In the nation as a whole, employees at smaller businesses tend to earn lower compensation than employees in larger businesses, probably indicating they are less productive, Burtless said. All these facts lead me to believe there is no possible way those 120,000 small businesses can account for 96 percent of the production or output of the West Virginia economy. Manchins office declined to comment for this article. Manchin said that small businesses in West Virginia make up about 96 percent of our state's economy. This appears to be a case of mistaken terminology. Small businesses do make up nearly 99 percent of the states employers, but only half of its employees. The way it is worded, Manchin's claim exaggerates the output of small businesses and underplays the economic influence of large companies in the state.",0.4,0.7,0.9,0.5,0.1,0.5,0.6,0.8,0.4,Mostly False

Final Rating: Mostly False","In sanctuary cities, local officials order police to release dangerous criminal aliens to prey upon the public instead of handing them over to ICE to be safely removed.","During the 2020 State of the Union address, President Donald Trump slammed sanctuary cities for their limited cooperation with Immigration and Customs Enforcement. In sanctuary cities, local officials order police to release dangerous criminal aliens to prey upon the public instead of handing them over to ICE to be safely removed, he said. Trump cited an incident in which an undocumented immigrant released from custody allegedly assaulted and killed a 92-year-old woman in New York City. Trump also spotlighted the brother of a man killed in a crime spree by an undocumented immigrant released in California. The United States of America should be a sanctuary for law-abiding Americans, not criminal aliens, he said, calling on Congress to pass a bill to let victims sue sanctuary cities. Theres no federal definition for a sanctuary city, and the details vary from place to place. But broadly speaking, the term refers to any jurisdiction that refuses to continue holding people in local jails beyond their jail or prison sentence solely because ICE has asked the jurisdiction to do so. (ICEs request is formally known as a detainer.) The individual cases Trump addressed were documented in media reports, and the White House has published a list of other criminal noncitizens shielded from ICE officials. But Trumps claim that local officials order police to release dangerous criminal aliens makes setting criminals free sounds like standard operating procedure. As we detailed while fact-checking a similar claim in 2018, thats not the case. Even sanctuary cities typically turn over to ICE many of the felons Trump warns about. The White House and Trump campaign did not respond to requests for comment. ICE news releases report numerous instances of ignored detainer requests that result in undocumented immigrants being set free and later arrested by ICE. According to ICEs report for the 2019 fiscal year, 86% of the roughly 143,000 noncitizens arrested by ICE had criminal convictions or pending charges. Its unclear how many were arrested after being released in sanctuary cities. The report says ICE issued 165,487 detainers to law enforcement officials, and that a number of aliens who have been released under these circumstances have gone on to commit additional crimes. Some insight came during an October Senate hearing, when ICE official Timothy Robbins said the agency brought roughly 1,300 noncitizens into custody over the span of a few weeks, including large numbers of people who had been released in sanctuary cities. Robbins said three of those 1,300 people had prior convictions for manslaughter or murder, 100 had convictions for sexual assault or related crimes, 70 had convictions for drug-related crimes, and 320 had convictions for driving under the influence. Almost 200 of the aliens arrested during the most recent operation could have been taken into custody at local jails if the detainer had been honored, Robbins said. Robbins did not say whether any of the 200 people ICE targeted with detainers went on to commit further crimes or, in Trumps words, prey on Americans. Sanctuary policies across the country treat dangerous criminals differently, but experts told us many have specific ways of dealing with them. A number of the sanctuary policies have carve-outs for individuals with certain types of felony offenses, and some non-felony offenses, Annie Lai, clinical professor of law at the University of California Irvine, told us. You want to see if the policy allows for detention for ICE, notification to ICE, transfer to ICE or transfer only with a warrant. Each of these mean different things. Californias sanctuary law, for example, gives law enforcement officials leeway to hold someone for ICE if theyve committed one of a number of crimes. The list includes gang-related offenses, assault, battery, sexual abuse and exploitation, rape, crimes endangering children, burglary, robbery, theft, fraud, forgery, any crime resulting in death, some domestic violence offenses, and drug and weapon-related offenses. In New York City, people convicted of one or more of 177 types of felonies within the last five years can be handed over to ICE authorities, but only if those authorities secure a warrant first. Michelle Mittelstadt, director of communications at the Migration Policy Institute, told us shes unaware of a jurisdiction that releases dangerous criminal aliens as a matter of policy. Where jurisdictions have set limits on their cooperation with ICE typically revolve around the issue of whether the agency is seeking transfer of a noncitizen who has been booked or charged versus an offender who is completing a criminal sentence, as well as whether ICE needs to seek a court order for the request to detain a noncitizen, she added. Mittelstadt explained that when noncitizens are released in sanctuary cities, the criminal justice process has taken place or is taking place as it would in the case of anyone else. When state and local prisons release noncitizens without transfer to ICE, the person has completed their criminal sentence, has been released without charge, or has been charged and released on bond pending further action in the criminal justice system, she said. The New York City murder suspect Trump mentioned had originally been arrested for attacking his father with a broken coffee cup and arraigned on charges of assault and criminal possession of a weapon before he was released pending trial, according to reports. He had not yet been convicted on those charges by the time of the alleged murder. Meanwhile, the California man who went on a crime spree in 2018 had previously been convicted of armed robbery. But the charge was 15 years old, meaning local police couldnt use it to justify holding him for ICE, according to the Washington Post. He had been deported twice before, in 2004 and 2014, and was arrested in 2018 after a caller reported erratic behavior. He tested positive for use of a controlled substance, but because that offense only carried a misdemeanor charge, he was released after 10 hours in custody. Mike Boudreaux, the county sheriff on the case, blamed Californias sanctuary law for keeping his officers from coordinating with ICE authorities. That tool has been removed from our hands, he said, according to the Washington Post. And because of that, our county was shot up by a violent criminal. Trump said, In sanctuary cities, local officials order police to release dangerous criminal aliens to prey upon the public instead of handing them over to ICE to be safely removed. Sanctuary policies dont mean that undocumented criminals get to walk free of charges, or that local officials order police to release them as standard operating procedure. Noncitizens facing arrest still go through the criminal justice system; sanctuary policies mean that they arent turned over to ICE authorities after theyve done so. Still, many sanctuary policies include specific provisions allowing law enforcement to comply with ICEs requests when it comes to noncitizens who have been convicted of felonies. Thats the case in both California and New York City — the two places Trump called out by name. Media reports and ICE press releases have documented some cases in which noncitizens with serious criminal records were released by police in spite of detainer requests. But these individuals had already gone through the criminal justice system in one way or another.",0.3,0.8,0.7,0.4,0.6,0.9,0.5,0.5,0.3,Mostly False

Final Rating: Mostly False  ",Says opponent Mary Burke told reporters she would have required workers to give up bargained-for healthcare and retirement benefits like Gov. Walker.,"Democrat Brett Hulsey says that any union member who supports Mary Burke is like a chicken who votes for Colonel Sanders. Thems fightin words -- and theyre aimed at a fellow Democrat vying to take on Republican Gov. Scott Walker in the November election. Hulsey, a state representative from Madison and former vice president of a union local at a Sierra Club office, alleges outsourcing of jobs by Trek Bicycle when Burke was a Trek board member. Hulsey is also displeased with Burkes support of a charter school in Madison, where she is on the school board. But what really miffs Hulsey is Burke saying it was reasonable and fair for public employees to pay more toward their state-funded pensions and health insurance in 2011. In his controversial move to sharply limit collective bargaining, Walker and fellow Republicans imposed those cost-sharing moves on state employees and cleared the way for local governments to do the same. It was part of the law known as Act 10. Hulsey is accusing Burke of Walker-like anti-union behavior regarding those benefits and other issues. She supports taking public servants healthcare and retirement benefits, Hulsey claimed in a May 21, 2014 news release. And in a letter to Burke in advance of the South Central Federation of Labors annual bean feed, a long-running celebration sponsored by the Madison-based labor union umbrella group, Hulsey wrote: You told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel that you would have required workers to give up bargained for healthcare and retirement benefits like Gov. Walker. Is Hulsey right? Burkes statements on Act 10 Burke, who entered the governors race in early October 2013, has been remarkably consistent in her comments on Act 10. As support for his claim, Hulsey cites an April 18, 2014 interview with the Journal Sentinel in which Burke said she would work to restore collective bargaining for public workers while still seeking efficient government. In the interview, Burke said: If I had been governor I would have made sure I bargained for the changes that needed to be made to balance the state budget. I think it was only fair to ask for contributions to health care and pensions but I think those could have been negotiated, certainly firmly but fairly. Walkers approach, she said, left the state divided and has caused teachers and prospective educators to question whether salaries and benefits will be sufficient to support their careers and pay off student loans. Wisconsin walked away from the table and left it in a worse place, Burke said. So, Burke staked out a somewhat nuanced position. She defended getting public workers to pay more. She said shed have negotiated over the pension and health changes, in contrast to Walkers approach of removing those as subjects of bargaining. And she suggested she could have achieved a result similar to Walkers by being firm in her ask for the benefits changes. Could she have? Thats debatable. In 2011, some union leaders at one point said theyd agree to the benefits givebacks. But that was under extreme pressure because Walker had the votes for the stringent limits on bargaining -- and a ban on employers from deducting union dues from employee paychecks. In any event, its clear from Burkes comments that she wanted a similar result on pension and healthcare cost-sharing as Walker, but wouldnt -- and couldnt -- have required workers to pay more. Thats because, she said, shed have negotiated to try to get that. But her comments also suggest she would have made a high priority of getting those fair givebacks in exchange for something else. Burkes comments have been met with disappointment from some quarters on the left and among union leaders, but shes received endorsements from the largest state employee union, major teachers unions and the state AFL-CIO. They said her support is clear for collective bargaining, which she described as something that I believe in and think is right for our state, in an appearance on The Devils Advocates radio show. Meanwhile, Hulsey is making a full-throated pledge to try to repeal Act 10 as a whole, including the benefits cuts, saying the cuts were not necessary. He has pledged to provide back pay to workers whose wages declined because of the act. Hulsey told us that Burkes comments -- that she would have negotiated the benefits changes she needed -- amount to an approach that would have required the cuts of workers, just in a more humane way than Walker. Our rating Hulsey claimed Burke told Journal Sentinel reporters and editors that she would have required workers to give up bargained-for healthcare and retirement benefits like Gov. Walker. Theres an element of truth here in that Burke did say she backed benefits cuts in the same areas as Walker got, and was confident she could have achieved them. But Hulseys phrasing makes it sound like Burke backs Walkers approach. Thats a huge stretch given that she would have left collective bargaining intact and tried to negotiate the cost-cutting moves.",0.7,0.6,0.9,0.5,0.4,0.5,0.4,0.8,0.6,Mostly False

Final Rating: Mostly False",The Democrats filibustered the legislation that wouldve resulted in this shooter being in federal prison instead of murdering those innocents in that Texas church.,"Reacting to the church shootings in Sutherland Springs, Texas, Sen. Ted Cruz said there could have been laws on the books to prevent what happened, had his opponents in Congress not defeated his proposal a few years ago. The Democrats filibustered the legislation that wouldve resulted in this shooter being in federal prison instead of murdering those innocents in that Texas church, Cruz said on Fox News on Nov. 6. Cruz, a Republican,is talking about a failed amendment he co-sponsored to curtail an expansion of background checks and increase prosecution of people who lied about their criminal histories to obtain firearms. He has a point that the Democrats didnt back it, but he fails to mention that every amendment on the 2013 gun control bill faced the same hurdle, and a Democratic one also fell short. While Democrats defeated his proposal, experts said it would not have made the crucial difference in this massacre for a couple of reasons. The Texas church shooter was discharged from the Air Force for bad conduct after he was court-martialed in 2012 for assaulting his wife and fracturing his stepson's skull. Federal law prohibited him from buying or possessing firearms after this conviction, but he got past the background check system because the Air Force failed to enter the shooters felony into the background check database. So when he purchased two guns at the San Antonio gun shop Academy Sports + Outdoors, both sales were approved by the National Instant Criminal Background Check System. When we asked Cruzs office for details, they softened what Cruz originally said, saying his legislation would have increased the chances of preventing the Air Force error that led to the failure to submit the relevant information to NICS. The amendment pushed for clearer guidance on submissions of federal records to the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (mandated by NICS Improvement Amendments Act of 2007) and required that federal agencies submit plans for making the information available. The only possible contribution may have been that the reporting requirement to the AG might have led the Defense Department and the Air Force to realize that the procedures they had in place needed enhancement, said Geoffrey Corn, a law professor at South Texas College of Law Houston. But the language was a near replica of President Barack Obamas Jan. 16, 2013 memorandum to the Justice Department, which officials were already trying to implement. Molly Moran, who served as the Principal Deputy Associate Attorney General from 2014 to 2016, said she and her colleagues at the Justice Department worked from 2013 until the end of Obamas second term in implementing the memo. It made no difference in the Texas church shooting. The Air Force needed to submit the shooters 2012 court-martial, and it failed to do so. Cruz said on Fox that a lack of reporting of federal and state records to the background check system was a problem. But his legislation did not seem to make this easier. The amendment eliminated sanctions for states that failed to submit records and lowered the cap on grant money to help states submit them from $100 million to $20 million. The original bill from then-Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., would have expanded background checks on purchases from only federally licensed gun dealers to all transfers, even private ones among family members, with few exceptions. But the Grassley-Cruz amendment chucked the expansion of background checks and even allowed for the interstate sale and transportation of firearms. If anything, the only way this would have affected the Texas shooting would be to make it easier for the shooter to attack a church in a neighboring state instead, said Gregory Koger, a political science professor at the University of Miami. Cruz also summoned a familiar talking point against gun regulation that few background check lies (where felons say they are not felons) are prosecuted. His amendment created a task force to increase these prosecutions, but it did not mandate that the Justice Department prosecute all of them. Enhanced prosecution efforts still would not have put the shooter behind bars. Without the court-martial in the database, the shooter would still have passed the background check after marking that he was not a felon. He could have been prosecuted had his lie been known by prosecutors, but they had no reason to investigate this until after the shooting, said Adam Winkler, a law professor at University of California, Los Angeles. Reid set a 60-vote threshold on all amendments to his Safe Communities, Safe Schools Act of 2013 to prevent a situation in which the amendment passed by a bare majority and then was filibustered — by the Republican minority. Cruzs amendment failed 52-48, with nine Democrats voting for it and two Republicans voting against (Mark Kirk of Illinois and Mike Lee of Utah). So did the bipartisan Toomey-Manchin background check amendment favored by Democrats, which got 54 votes. Experts said it was fair to call this a filibuster, though Reid attained the Senate's unanimous consent for the 60-vote threshold. The notion that the Democrats are responsible for the failure of this proposal ignores the fact that the GOP was filibustering the underlying bill, which had all the same provisions except the state-to-state expansion of gun rights and a requirement to expand background checks, Koger said. Cruz said, The Democrats filibustered the legislation that wouldve resulted in this shooter being in federal prison. The amendment Cruz cosponsored, which was defeated largely by Democrats after failing to reach a 60-vote threshold, strengthened efforts to prosecute people who lied about their criminal histories to obtain firearms. But the shooter in this case wouldnt have showed up as having lied because of the Air Forces failure to report his felony. The Cruz proposal also aimed to facilitate reporting to the instant background check system with guidelines and deadlines for federal agencies, including the armed services. While similar action by the Obama Justice Department around the same time didnt help, Cruzs clarifications becoming law may have. But its impossible to say with any certainty.",0.5,0.7,0.9,0.6,0.8,0.7,0.5,1.0,0.4,Mostly False

Final Rating: Mostly False  ","In states that have legalized (recreational marijuana), you see steady decreases in youth use if you do it right.","Among the issues taking center stage in Springfield as lawmakers enter the final stretch of the legislative session is whether Illinois should join a growing number of states in lifting a prohibition on recreational marijuana. While the legislation under consideration would bar legal sales to those under 21, critics have raised concerns that the easier access could still lead to greater use among teens. One Democratic lawmaker who spoke in support of the plan when it was unveiled recently by Gov. J.B. Pritzker was state Rep. Kelly Cassidy, a Chicago Democrat. Cannabis should be sold in venues that are highly regulated, taking the pot market out of the shadows, Cassidy said. In states that have legalized, you see steady decreases in youth use if you do it right. PolitiFact in recent years has assessed changes in pot use among youth while investigating claims about how legalization has affected citizens in Colorado, which became the first state in the nation to greenlight retail sales in 2014 after voters approved cannabis for adult recreational use by ballot measure in 2012. Since 2014, the data show no statistically significant uptick in pot usage among teens so legalization hardly leads to the reefer madness some critics feared. But the numbers available for Colorado and other states that have lifted bans for adults also dont reveal the clear pattern of decline in youth pot use that Cassidy described. If lawmakers approve the plan, Illinois could become the 11th state to allow adults to use cannabis recreationally and the second in the Midwest, after Michigan, where voters in November approved a measure legalizing the drug. So far, retail sales are up and running in seven of those states, including three in just the last three years. That makes it harder to come by comprehensive statistics. Cassidy sent us an email promising an aide would share the studies out of Colorado, but nothing arrived from the lawmakers office as of our deadline. She also didnt explain what she meant by do it right. Colorado and Washington were the first states to legalize retail marijuana sales, so they have the longest track records to study. In Colorado, a 2018 report by the state Department of Public Safety'sDivision of Justice reviewed data from the Healthy Kids Colorado Survey, which includes answers to various health questions asked of more than 40,000 middle and high school students every other year. The survey is conducted by the states Department of Public Health & Environment. Results from the survey show 19.7% of Colorado high schoolers reported using marijuana within the past month in 2013, the year before the first retail marijuana store opened. In 2015, that figure rose slightly, but experts told PolitiFact in 2016 that increase was not statistically significant. In 2017, the rate dipped to 19.4%, slightly lower than it had been in previous surveys dating back to least 2005. But the Colorado report includes a major disclaimer. It states upfront that the majority of data related to marijuana legalization is baseline and preliminary, making it difficult to draw conclusions about the potential effects of marijuana legalization and commercialization on public safety, public health, or youth outcomes due to the lack of historical data. Jonathan Caulkins, a public policy professor at Carnegie Mellon University and former co-director of RANDs Drug Policy Research Center, echoed that warning to PolitiFact Illinois. The full effects of cannabis legalization wont be seen for a generation after national legalization, which has not even happened yet, he wrote in an email. As for preliminary state results? Caulkins said that making recreational marijuana legal for adults has done little to affect use by youth — in large part because cannabis was already relatively easy for minors to obtain in those states. Indeed, material included in the Colorado survey characterizes as relatively unchanged the slight variations in teen marijuana use since legalization. Voters in Washington also approved recreational cannabis in late 2012, and retail sales of the drug there began in 2014, six months after Colorado. The state conducts a biennial youth health survey similar to Colorados, which breaks its data down by grades. Its results show some small declines but suggest little has changed there either, with decreases of 1% between 2014 and 2016 among 8th and 10th graders who said they currently used pot, followed by 1% increases for both grades in 2018. For 12th graders, rates fell by 1% the year after retail sales began and have remained at that level, which is in line with pre-legalization rates. The findings with respect to youth are generally mixed and depend critically on what measures of youth use one wants to focus on, said Rosalie Pacula, a senior economist with RAND and current co-director of the Drug Policy Research Center who analyzed survey data for Washington and Colorado in several recent reports. She explained in an email to us that studies of states where adult use is legal generally show either no effect or some decline in past-year or 30-day use rates among youth, depending on the survey data used. But results for more frequent and risky use are a bit more mixed, she said, with some showing an uptick. Changes in the other five states where retail sales are underway are even more difficult to evaluate than Colorado or Washington. Alaskas state survey reported no statistically significant changes since recreational cannabis was approved for adults in 2014 and hit the market in 2016. Results in Oregon, which followed a similar timeline, were mixed. And its too soon to assess results out of Nevada, California and Massachusetts, which each repealed bans in late 2016 but only began allowing sales within the last two years. Cassidy said, In states that have legalized, you see steady decreases in youth use if you do it right. She did not provide any proof to back up her statement. Of the 10 states that allow adults to use cannabis recreationally, only four have permitted retail sales long enough to provide enough data points for a preliminary comparison. While state survey data show no spike in current marijuana use among teens, they also fall short of suggesting the downward trajectory Cassidy described.

Final Rating: Mostly False",The National Debt in my first month went down by $12 billion.,"In an early morning tweet Saturday, President Donald Trump echoed a post on a fringe website claiming that the national debt has decreased by $12 billion since Trump took office. The media has not reported that the National Debt in my first month went down by $12 billion vs a $200 billion increase in Obama first mo., Trump posted on Twitter Feb. 25, 2017. The media has not reported that the National Debt in my first month went down by $12 billion vs a $200 billion increase in Obama first mo. The tweet mirrors an article posted on the Gateway Pundit website a few days earlier. It was repeated by conservative pundit Herman Cain on Fox News shortly before Trumps tweet. On January 20th, the day of the Trump Inauguration, the US Debt stood at $19,947 billion, the Gateway Pundit website reads. On February 21st, a month later, the US Debt load stood at $19,935 billion. Trump cut the US Debt burden by $12 billion and 0.1% in his first month in office! The numbers check out. And in fact, the total public debt has dropped another $22 billion since the Gateway Pundit article published, according to data from the U.S. Department of Treasury. But, experts say, people shouldnt read much into the numbers. Nor should Trump be popping champagne. Considering that Trump hasnt enacted any fiscal legislation, its a bit of a stretch for him to take credit for any changes in debt levels, Dan Mitchell, a libertarian economist and senior fellow at the Cato Institute, told us. Debt levels go up and down in the short run based on independent factors such as quarterly tax payments and predetermined expenditure patterns, he said. The White House did not respond to our query for this fact-check. Looking at the debt numbers Trump and the Gateway Pundit are examining the total public debt outstanding, which is nearing $20 trillion. Experts said another figure to focus on is debts held by the public, which is the amount of money the United States government owes someone else. On Jan. 20, when Trump took office, the debt held by the public sat at $14.4 trillion. That figure fluctuated up and down a bit, but as of Feb. 22, it remained $14.4 trillion. On Feb. 23, the debt held by the public figure dropped to $14.38 trillion. Heres a chart that shows debt figures on selected days since Trump took office. Date Debt Held by the Public Intragovernmental Holdings Total Public Debt Outstanding 01/20/2017 14,403,704,176,388.94 5,543,600,378,823.55 19,947,304,555,212.49 01/27/2017 14,387,267,502,732.51 5,551,752,332,096.38 19,939,019,834,828.89 02/02/2017 14,366,132,157,960.80 5,536,695,305,608.30 19,902,827,463,569.10 02/07/2017 14,365,365,821,333.09 5,530,397,847,836.97 19,895,763,669,170.06 02/09/2017 14,402,429,500,385.19 5,519,906,129,921.50 19,922,335,630,306.69 02/14/2017 14,404,012,711,812.97 5,528,666,521,903.19 19,932,679,233,716.16 02/15/2017 14,417,333,314,382.25 5,520,031,281,120.76 19,937,364,595,503.01 02/16/2017 14,403,392,566,439.40 5,523,188,600,438.96 19,926,581,166,878.36 02/22/2017 14,404,723,995,058.93 5,531,156,856,922.13 19,935,880,851,981.06 02/23/2017 14,384,082,361,381.86 5,529,818,758,806.29 19,913,901,120,188.15 So, in isolation, the debt held by the public is down since Trump took office. But experts say its likely to shoot back up any day. I wonder what he thinks he did to bring this about, said Harvard University government professor Jeffrey Frankel. This one-month number is trivial in the long-run trend. The national debt will rise this year, and in future years. It will rise at a sharply accelerated rate if Trump carries out even half of his campaign promises for specific tax cuts (and specific spending increases). Will he be willing to be judged by the debt numbers in the future? Dean Baker, an economist with the liberal Center for Economic and Policy Research, said the temporary dip in the debt is triggered by the timing of tax payments and government spending, both matters that he has not affected one iota. AddedNeil Buchanan, a George Washington University law professor and author of The Debt Ceiling Disasters:No one who knows anything about budgeting would take a 30-day change to have any meaning at all.There is no credit to take, because it's like noticing that rainfall numbers from one month to the next are not exactly the same or that attendance at baseball games is not a constant number. Donald Marron, Director of Economic Policy Initiatives at the Urban Institute,speculated that the drop in debt may be because President Barack Obamas administration left Trump with cash on hand to run the government. So the government's need to borrow hasn't been high recently. On Jan. 20, the day Trump took office, the federal government had a cash operating balance of $382 billion, according to the Treasury Department. By Feb. 22, the cash balance had dropped to $228 billion. Our ruling Trump tweeted, The National Debt in my first month went down by $12 billion. Trump would be wise to not read too much into this figure, which sounds more noteworthy than it actually is. The national debt fluctuates up and down depending on the day. While the debt is down after one month, experts say that trend will reverse and the debt will continue to rise. This factoid is a gross misrepresentation of the state of the debt and the role the new president had in shaping the figure. Update: This post has been updated to include comments from Neil Buchanan and to include Donald Marron's current title. ",0.5,0.7,1.0,0.6,0.2,0.6,0.5,1.0,0.4,Mostly False

Final Rating: Mostly False  ","Says Gov. Scott Walker raises the pay of inmates, but we don't raise the pay of staff in our correctional institutions.","Wisconsin state employees union leader Marty Beil is no fan of Gov. Scott Walker. And his criticism has not relented since Walker survived an historic recall election in June 2012.Beil took aim at Walker on July 19, 2012 in an interview with John Sly Sylvester, a liberal radio talk show host on WTDY AM-FM in Madison.Walker raises the pay of inmates, Beil complained, but we don't raise the pay of staff in our correctional institutions.In 2011, Walker curbed state employees collective bargaining powers and cut their take-home pay by forcing them to pay more for their pensions and health insurance. He also put tighter restrictions on overtime for corrections workers.But has the Republican governor increased the pay of inmates who work in prisons, yet not given raises to the officers who work there?Beil's evidenceBeil is executive director of the Madison-based Council 24 of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees union, which represents corrections officers and a variety of other state employees.Asked for evidence to back his claim, he forwarded to us a May 2012 email from Lizzie Tegels, warden of the New Lisbon Correctional Institution, a 500-cell, medium-security prison 80 miles northwest of Madison.It says the prison would no longer pay a lower wage to inmates during their first 60 days of work. Paying new inmate workers a few pennies per hour less during their probationary period costs more -- in staff time to adjust pay rates -- than if the inmates received the regular wage, the email said.So, this isnt giving any working inmates a pay raise. Rather, inmates new to working would get a higher starting wage than they would have previously, but only during their first two months on the job.Beil told us the change wasn't occurring only at New Lisbon, but suggested we contact the Department of Corrections for details.Since Beil's claim was aimed at Walker, we contacted the governor's office, as well as the Department of Corrections. Walker spokesman Cullen Werwie and DOC spokeswoman Linda Eggert confirmed that corrections employees have not received a general raise since Walker took office in January 2011.Indeed, lawmakers in November 2011 imposed a two-year pay freeze on state employees, although merit raises can be given.So, the second part of Beils claim, that corrections workers havent gotten any raises under Walker, is correct. DOC response As for inmate pay, the governors spokesman provided a response written by the office of Corrections Secretary Gary Hamblin.According to the memo:Wisconsin prisons can pay working inmates a lower wage during their probation period, but most don't; neither does Badger State Industries, which oversees the manufacturing of license plates and other goods made by inmates.Eliminating the lower pay rate at New Lisbon means that current and future workers now start at the regular pay grade. That ranges from 9 to 42 cents an hour (and 1 to 20 cents through Badger State Industries). About 1,000 inmates work at New Lisbon, with about 20 to 25 on probationary status at any given time.Eggert said DOC surveyed all prisons after we contacted her and found that none had given inmates any raises or eliminated lower probationary rates like New Lisbon did.So, the higher pay rate is limited to the relatively few working inmates at one prison, and only applies to their first two months on the job.Our ratingBeil said Walker has raised the pay of working inmates, but we don't raise the pay of staff in our correctional institutions. Neither group, however, has received a pay raise.The pay rate at one prison is now higher for new workers during their two-month probation period, but that was done not to give inmates raises but to save money for taxpayers.",0.5,0.5,1.0,0.5,0.3,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.4,Mostly False

Final Rating: Mostly False  ",SaysCongressman Jack Kingston voted to raise his pay seven times.,"Veteran U.S. Rep. Jack Kingston of Savannah and millionaire businessman David Perdue are stepping up their attacks as decision day rapidly approaches in the GOP primary runoff for the U.S. Senate. Kingston and Perdue are locked in whats arguably the most contentious and closely watched Georgia contest on the July 22 primary runoff ballot. Charges and countercharges are flying. One of the charges being leveled by Perdue, the front-runner in the May primary, is that Kingston has wasted tax dollars on earmarks all while voting to raise his own pay seven times. PolitiFact has already examined the claim about Kingstons record on earmarks. Now, well delve into the second part of the claim thats currently airing on television and radio and answer the question: Did Kingston, a member of Congress since 1993, vote to raise his own congressional pay seven times? With public opinion of Congress in the tank, House and Senate members have been loath to raise their own pay. Thats likely why congressional raises are a campaign issue, not just this year and not just in Kingstons race. That also may explain why fact-checking the claim is more complicated than simply pulling legislation and checking individual House and Senate members votes. First, a little history. Article I, Section 6, of the Constitution requires members of Congress to set their own pay. From 1789 to 1968, members of Congress passed specific bills that raised their pay 22 times, according to a June 2014 report by the Congressional Research Service. Members of Congress were initially paid a daily rate -- $6 a day in 1789 -- and drew their first annual salary -- $1,500 -- in 1815. Forty years later, they were drawing $3,000 a year. But since passage of the Ethics Reform Act of 1989, members of the House and Senate have been eligible for annual raises without having to be on-record voting for them. The raises are calculated by a formula that involves changes in private-sector wages and salaries. They are automatic each Jan. 1 unless Congress votes to reject the adjustment or votes to change the amount. According to the Congressional Research Service, lawmakers have let their pay be increased automatically 13 times. Theyve also voted to decline or delay their raises during 11 years, including in 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013 and 2014. Kingston voted with the majority eight times. That is, Kingston voted to limit his pay, not increase it. In January 2009, congressional salaries went from $169,300 to their current $174,000. (And unless they vote again to decline a raise, lawmakers pay is set to increase 1.6 percent, or $2,800, in January, according to recent estimates.) So how can Perdue say that Kingston voted to raise his own pay seven times when automatic pay raises were established in 1989 and Kingstons only been in Congress since Jan. 3, 1993? Heres the simple answer: Perdues not counting Kingstons votes in favor of raising congressional salaries. Instead, Perdues counting procedural votes Kingston cast. Those votes blocked efforts to nix the automatic pay raises. PolitiFact checked a similar claim in 2011 when U.S. Rep. Connie Mack IV came under attack by Republican rival George LeMieux in Floridas U.S. Senate race. That was rated a Half True. Perdues claim, like LeMieuxs, is based largely on procedural votes. The votes by Kingston took place in 1999, 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004, 2006 and 2007, Perdue spokesman Derrick Dickey said. We'll try to explain a complicated process as simply as we can. A member of Congress -- for years it was U.S. Rep. Jim Matheson, D-Utah -- pushes for an up-or-down vote on continuing the automatic pay raises. In most years, a procedural vote is used to effectively block that effort. Alyson Heyrend, Matheson's then-spokeswoman, explained the procedural move to PolitiFact in 2011. Matheson each year sought a 'no' vote on a procedural vote on Ordering the Previous Question, she told Politifact in an email. Had a majority voted 'no' he would have then offered the amendment to deny the annual congressional pay raise. Matheson was concerned that the public isn't able to see Congress take an open, up-or-down vote on whether or not to raise their salaries, Heyrend said. Pete Sepp, executive vice president of the National Taxpayers Union and Foundation, said its important to understand that any efforts on the pay raises are always tied to larger bills dealing with appropriations. People of varying ideologies and causes would have numerous reasons for supporting or opposing the bill, Sepp said, meaning that votes for or against a bill could have something or nothing to do with the pay raise. In 1999, for instance, Rep. Ernie Fletcher, R, Ky., argued that lawmakers shouldnt take a $3,800 raise, boosting their pay to $145,000 a year, saying: I have a hard time voting to increase my pay when people in my district are earning an average income of $25,000 a year. According to press reports from the time, Fletchers move was defeated on a procedural vote, 250-173. House journals show Kingston voting with the majority. The journals also show Kingston voting Yes with the majority on similar procedural votes in 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004, 2006 and 2007. Those votes blocked efforts by Matheson, Fletcher and others to put forth an amendment to stop the pay raise. And even if they had not been blocked, a majority would have still had to go along with their amendment, several congressional experts told us. So, did Kingston vote seven times to give himself a raise? No. He didnt have to because the raises are automatic unless Congress votes to turn them down as they have for five years. Did he vote to stop a push for an up-or-down vote on accepting or rejecting the raises? Yes. He did that seven times. But he also voted with the majority to deny or delay the raises eight times. Greg Dolan, Kingstons congressional spokesman, said: Representative Kingston was not voting to increase his pay any more than he was voting against renaming the moon. Just because a potential amendment may have been introduced, voting to get on with the work of the House is not equivalent to voting against any and all other extraneous issues, he said. Dickey, Perdues spokesman, said the pay raises were inappropriate and Kingston knew that as far back as 1992 when he told a Savannah paper that congressional raises should be tied to passage of a balanced budget Our ruling Congress has created a system that allows its members to receive annual raises without having to vote on them. Perdue is off base to say Kingston voted to raise his pay seven times. Kingston cast procedural votes -- with the majority -- that effectively allowed Congress automatic pay raises to stand in some years. Kingston did not cast direct votes to raise his pay as Perdues ads imply. When there was a direct vote to decline pay increases, Kingston voted with the majority to do just that eight times. Theres a bit of truth to Perdues claim. But theres even more context missing. ",0,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,Mostly False

Final Rating: Mostly False  ",Wisconsin has no tracing program going on that we can speak of.,"Facing a growing push to re-open Wisconsin, Gov. Tony Evers has laid out a series of key benchmarks for easing social distancing restrictions, dubbed the Badger Bounce Back plan. The state is tracking data on cases, symptoms and hospital usage, but Evers has also pointed to three other logistical elements: access to personal protective gear, expanded testing and expanded contact tracing. Senate Majority Leader Scott Fitzgerald homed in on the last of those while criticizing Evers in an April 26, 2020, interview with WISN-TVs UpFront program. We need better information. More explanations, said Fitzgerald, R-Juneau. They have no tracing program going on that we can speak of. Contact tracing, done by public health officials, is the process of supporting patients with suspected or confirmed infections. Steps include identifying who else they had contact with, warning those other individuals and educating everyone exposed on how to protect themselves and others through isolation and other steps. Its a fundamental element of the pandemic response, helping to identify clusters of cases early on to minimize the spread. Does Wisconsin really have no such program to speak of? Asked for evidence of the claim, Fitzgerald spokesman Alec Zimmerman said this: The point he was trying to make is the same that (Wisconsin Department of Health Services) makes daily in the briefings -- tracing as it is now isnt enough. Zimmerman noted the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel has reported on shortcomings in the system. For instance, the newspaper contacted 10 people who had the disease or lost loved ones within the first few weeks of the outbreak, and seven said they were never contacted by health officials as of April 23 when the story published. A story published May 1, 2020, detailed how Milwaukee has added staffing and made other changes to improve the tracing program. Health officials across the nation are scrambling to add contact tracers. The number of tracers needed for the pandemic is about double the usual need, according to the National Association of County and City Health Officials. Public health nurses do this regularly, for example, for sexually transmitted diseases or tuberculosis, DHS spokeswoman Elizabeth Goodsitt said in an email. What is new in this space is mainly the large scale of cases and the speed at which the virus is able to spread – which means we need additional contact tracers to do this work so that we are able to reach each identified exposed person really quickly. DHS doesnt know how many tracers are working in Wisconsin or how many tracing investigations have been done since those efforts are lead by local health departments. DHS Deputy Secretary Julie Willems Van Dijk said at the April 28 COVID-19 media briefing that the goal is to have 1,000 contact tracers between the DHS surge capacity and the capacity of local health departments. The state had trained 400 contact tracers as of April 30 to provide surge capacity for local health departments, Goodsitt said. The number trained was closer to 250 when Fitzgerald made his claim. The state surge team has been part of more than 1,100 interviews (as of April 30), which is just a fraction of calls our local public health tracers have made, Goodsitt said. The number of tracers varies widely among some of the states larger health departments. As of April 25, the Journal Sentinel reported the Milwaukee Health Department had dedicated 19 people to tracing, about 8% of its staff (though that was up to 54 by May 1, 2020). The Washington Ozaukee Health Department had dedicated 15 people, or about 38% of its 40-person staff. CBS 58 reported April 23 that Waukesha County had 30 contact tracers. Milwaukee officials told the Journal Sentinel the initial tracing interview had been conducted within a week for 92% of all positive cases in the city, but its an extensive process. They make about 10 contacts for every positive case. Fitzgerald said Wisconsin has no tracing program going on that we can speak of. Wisconsin — like every other state — is still ramping up the capacity for tracing. And there have clearly been gaps in the work so far. But its a significant exaggeration to summarize that as having no program when hundreds of people are doing this work around the state. Tracing was being done around the state when Fitzgerald said this, and those efforts have continued to ramp up since. ",0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,Mostly False

Final Rating: Mostly False  ",We have more kids take the SAT than any other state in the nation. I mean a high percentage of our kids take the SAT.,"As CNBC pronounced Texas the nation's best state for doing business, Gov. Rick Perry offered reasons why Texas is still on top during an interview with the business-news network. One of them: the number of Texas students participating in a national college-admissions' exam. We have more kids take the SAT than any other state in the nation, Perry said on the July 13 CNBC broadcast. I mean a high percentage of our kids take the SAT. Which is it? Bill White, the Democratic nominee for governor who has stressed education as an important issue, thinks it's neither. Rick Perry proved again yesterday that he simply can't tell the truth when it comes to education, a July 14 press release from White chided, saying that Perry gave blatantly false information about SATs. Later that day, the governor's office issued a press release pointing reporters to a July 14 Fortune magazine article that offered four reasons why Texas beats California in a recession. However, the article also notes that SAT scores in the state have declined over the last few years, and the state ranked 34th among the 52 states and jurisdictions graded on the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) last year. Confused? When we checked with Perry's campaign, spokeswoman Catherine Frazier tweaked the first of Perry's CNBC statements by saying Texas has more students taking the SAT than nearly any other state. According to the College Board, which manages the SAT exams, Texas ranked third in 2009 in the number of SAT takers — 141,733 public and private school students. Of course, Texas was also the second-most populous state. California, the most populous state, had the most SAT participants (207,301), followed by New York (159,886). We turned next to Perry's second statement, that a high percentage of our kids take the SAT — arguably a powerful talking point because a state's percentage of SAT takers signifies its share of potential college students. According to the College Board in 2009, Texas had the 22nd highest SAT participation rate (21st if you don't count the District of Columbia): 51 percent of Texas students in the class of 2009. The national average was 46 percent. Maine had the highest participation rate (90 percent), followed by New York, Massachusetts, Connecticut and D.C. In recent years, neither the percentage of SAT-takers in Texas nor the state's place in the College Board rankings has changed much. In 2008, Texas again came in 22nd, with 50 percent of students taking the test. In fact, as long as Perry has been governor, Texas has ranked 20th, 21st or 22nd. Its share of students taking the test has ranged from a high of 57 percent (2003) to, most recently, a low of 51 percent. So how does the governor's two-part statement score? We'll cut him slack for saying Texas has the most students taking the SAT, since he immediately backed off when questioned. And Texas did have the third-highest number of high-school students who took the SAT in 2009. Perry's statement that Texas has a high percentage of students taking the SAT begs the question: High compared to what? While the share of Texas students who took the test in 2009 exceeded the national average, 20 other states had greater shares of students taking the test including similarly high-population states such as Florida, Pennsylvania and New York. California had a smaller share: 49 percent. We figure high means better than barely above average. To stick with the school metaphor, 51 percent is a failing grade.

Final Rating: Mostly False  ",Says Mitt Romney runs away from Ronald Reagan.,"In a web video released on Jan. 13, 2012, Newt Gingrichs presidential campaign took aim at Massachusetts moderate Mitt Romney, comparing him to fellow Bay State politicians (and Democratic presidential losers) Michael Dukakis and John Kerry and even taking him to task for being able to speak French.The ad fires a fusillade of shots designed to show that Romney is too liberal to be a Republican presidential nominee. Weve chosen one of those claims to check.What has Massachusetts given us? the ad asks, offering grainy footage of Dukakis ill-fated tank ride during the 1988 campaign and Kerrys windsurfing from 2004. The video goes on to describe Romney as a Massachusetts moderate who runs away from Ronald Reagan, then cuts to a clip of Romney speaking during a debate while running for Senate in 1994. In the debate, Romney said, Look, I was an independent during the time of Reagan-Bush. Im not trying to return to Reagan-Bush.We have already looked at the question of Romneys view of Reagan, a conservative icon, during a fact-check of a Democratic National Committee ad on Nov. 29, 2011.The DNC ad from 2011 juxtaposes two clips of Romney talking. The first was the same one later used in the Gingrich ad. The second showed Romney standing at a podium saying, The principles that Ronald Reagan espoused are as true today as they were when he spoke them.The 1994 clip, which came during Romneys bid to unseat the late Sen. Edward Kennedy, showed part of an exchange in which the two men had a philosophical discussion about poverty and families. Kennedy, a liberal Democrat, claimed that child poverty rates rose when Republicans occupied the White House.Under the Reagan-Bush economic programs, under the economic programs you want to return to, the total number of children that are living in poverty, the total number of children out of wedlock -- this has happened, you know weve had Republican presidents during this period of time and the cutting back of support systems for children and most of all for families to get jobs, Kennedy said. If youre not going to provide a climate and an atmosphere for men and women to be able to work and provide for their children, youre going to see the breakdown of the family as well.Kennedy said discussions about supporting families shouldnt be used to score political hits, prompting Romney to fire back that he wasnt politicizing the issue -- Kennedy was.I mentioned nothing about politics or your position at all. I talked about what Id do to help strengthen families, and you talked about Reagan-Bush. Look, I was an independent during the time of Reagan-Bush. Im not trying to return to Reagan-Bush, Romney said, in a clear attempt to distance himself from the former president.In our fact-check of the DNC ad, we couldnt find any other references to Romney distancing himself from Reagan beyond the 1994 debate comment. Still, Romney did say it on live television, so we have no quarrel with the Gingrich campaign using it. The Gingrich ad also correctly identified it on-screen as having occurred in 1994, some 18 years ago.But we have a different problem with the Gingrich ad: It erred by using the present tense in the voice-over, saying that Mitt Romney runs away from Ronald Reagan. To us, that means that Romney is still distancing himself from Reagan. And thats definitely not the case.Consider the second clip in the DNC ad, in which Romney was speaking at the annual Reagan lecture at the Reagan library in Simi Valley, Calif., in May 2010. He was talking about Americas position in the world.I have to tell you that Im optimistic. Im optimistic about the future because I recognize that there is a growing awakening among the American people that this administration has put us on the wrong track and that the principles that Ronald Reagan espoused are as true today as they were when he spoke them.After some applause, Romney continued by elaborating on Reagan-like policies emphasizing low taxes, balanced budgets and strong families. While speaking about the need to keep America strong for the sake of world peace, he paraphrased that wonderful line of Reagans:(Reagan) said, Of the four wars that were begun during my lifetime, not one of them was begun because America was too strong. And hes absolutely right, Romney said.We found other examples of Romney's fealty to Reagan's legacy:• During his first presidential campaign in 2007, Romney blasted primary rival John McCain for voting against President George W. Bushs tax cuts. That's failing Reagan 101, Romney said, essentially holding up Reagan as the standard to which Republicans should aspire.• In a debate that year, he was asked whether the primary candidates would support the Republican nominee if it was someone else. Yes, Romney said, then added, I want that nominee, however, to come out of the same mold as Ronald Reagan.• When he proposed a detailed economic plan last year, Romney included a provision for a new Reagan Economic Zone, an international free-trade area designed to reward nations that have embraced free enterprise and open markets.• On Dec. 16, 2011, at a Fox News-sponsored debate, Romney referred to Reagan in explaining his change of heart on abortion. Both Romney and Reagan started off favoring abortion rights before shifting to an anti-abortion stance.I've learned over time, like Ronald Reagan and George Herbert Walker Bush and others, my experience in life over, what, 19 -- 17, 18, 19 years has told me that sometimes I was wrong, Romney said. Where I was wrong, I've tried to correct myself.• On Dec. 15, 2011, the Romney campaign unveiled a group called Reaganites for Romney, featuring officials who served in political or policy roles during the Reagan Administration.These individuals were part of a movement that changed America and the rest of the world, said Romney. The smaller government policies of the Reagan era helped turn around a struggling economy and create millions of jobs. And the strong defense of freedom around the world led to the crumbling of empires and dictatorships. I am proud to announce this group of conservative leaders – with their help we can recreate the robust job creation of the Reagan years.Our rulingGinrgichs ad contains a grain of truth: In one televised debate 18 years ago, Romney distanced himself from Reagan and his policies. But more recently, Romney has had only kind words to say about the Gipper. When the DNC charged that Romney had flip-flopped on his support for Reagans policies, we ruled that charge Mostly True. In this case, though, we dont think Romneys long-ago discomfort with Reagan-era policies justifies the Gingrich ads claim that Romney is a Massachusetts moderate who runs away from Ronald Reagan.",0.5,0.7,0.8,0.4,0.3,0.6,0.5,0.4,0.5,Mostly False

Final Rating: Mostly False  ","Says military commanders have said that if Donald Trump were elected, they would not follow his orders.","During a joint speech with Hillary Clinton in his ancestral home of Scranton, Pa., Vice President Joe Biden riffed on the ways he sees Donald Trump as being unfit for the presidency. One of the things that Biden said troubled him among Trumps past comments is his suggestion that the United States may need to utilize torture. Biden said that Trump has floated the use of torture when he knows it's illegal, and says he would still order it even though the military commanders said they would not obey his orders. When can you think of ever in history where military commanders have said before a man or woman is elected that they would not follow his orders? Biden has a point that Trump has advocated loosening laws on torture, including -- but not limited to -- waterboarding. Just one example: Trump said on CBSs Face the Nation that the United States needs tostrengthen the laws so that we can better compete with the brutal tactics of ISIS, and he dismissed the idea that allowing torture would be stooping to ISIS' level. We have to play the game the way they're playing the game, Trump said. You're not going to win if we're soft. In addition, Trump has proposed killing the families of terrorists, a policy that, as we have written before, would violate the Geneva Conventions. However, Bidens remark suggests that active military commanders have already said before the election that they would not follow certain orders issued by Trump. Thats an overstatement, although one that contains some degree of truth. Lets take a closer look. Who has said what about Trump so far? We could find no evidence -- and Bidens staff couldnt point to any -- showing active military commanders saying they would not follow certain orders from a President Trump. Typically, military officers do not comment on political matters while on active duty, in order to stay within the strictures of Defense Department Directive 1344.10. Senior national security retirees, though, are another story. Bidens staff pointed to comments made in February by former CIA director Michael Hayden on HBO's Real Time with Bill Maher. When Maher brought up Trump's idea of killing family members of terrorists, Hayden said, If he were to order that once in government, the American armed forces would refuse to act. Maher responded, What? Well, thats quite a statement, sir. In the meantime, 50 senior Republican national security officials signed a letter on Aug. 8, 2016, arguing that Trump lacks the character, values and experience to be president and would put at risk our countrys national security and well-being. The letter did not explicitly say that the signers would personally refuse, or encourage active commanders to refuse, an illegal order from Trump. But the letter represented a sharp rebuke to Trumps fitness for office by members of his partys national security establishment. We should point out that Trump does have some senior military retirees on his side as well, including former Defense Intelligence Agency chief Michael T. Flynn, decorated Army Maj. Gen. Bert Mizusawa, retired Marine Corps Brig. Gen. Mark Bircher, retired four star Air Force Gen. Robert Oaks, and retired Army Maj. Gen. Paul Vallely. Bottom line: In his Scranton comments, Biden exaggerated by saying that current military commanders have publicly said they would not follow illegal orders from Trump. Theres no evidence of that. What does the law say? That said, Bidens overstatement is somewhat moot -- because whether or not military commanders have publicly said in advance that they would refuse illegal orders, theres solid legal precedent that they should refuse an illegal order if one came their way. Under both international law and domestic law, a soldier has a duty to disobey a manifestly unlawful order, said Steven R. Ratner, a law professor at the University of Michigan. It doesnt matter who gave it. According to the Manual for Courts-Martial, if an order is patently illegal, a service member has an obliga­tion to disobey it, said Richard D. Rosen, director of the Texas Tech University's Center for Military Law & Policy. The so-called Nuremberg Defense to criminal activity — I was only following orders — excuses a service ­members crimi­nal actions only if the ordered actions are not palpably illegal, Rosen said. This represents a pretty high standard. However, the types of orders at issue here -- such as the infliction of torture and the intentional killing of civilians -- would likely qualify, experts said. I believe that an order to target and kill civilians intentionally, such as killing the families of terrorists, is patently illegal, and I would advise commanders and soldiers not to follow the order, Rosen said. He cited the Vietnam War case of Lt. William Calley, a platoon leader who was accused of killing civilians, including women, children, and elderly men, in the village of My Lai in South Vietnam. Calleys defense was that he was executing the orders of his company commander, but both the Army Court of Military Review and Court of Military Appeals rejected Calleys defense, Rosen said. How unusual is the backlash against Trump? Finally, experts say Biden has a point about the unusual extent of senior military concern about a presidential candidates potential for ordering illegal acts from the White House. There have certainly been overt disputes between presidents and commanders, such as between President Abraham Lincoln and Maj. Gen. George McClellan and between President Harry Truman and Gen. Douglas MacArthur, Rosen said. But I am not aware of cases in which active-duty servicemembers actually took sides in a political campaign. Anthony Clark Arend, a Georgetown University professor of government and foreign service, agreed. I can think of no historical precedent for members of the military and foreign policy community making statements relating to the need to disobey unlawful orders during a presidential campaign, Arend said. This truly seems unprecedented. Our ruling Biden said military commanders have said that if Trump were elected, they would not follow his orders. Biden has a point that retired military officials have spoken out against Trump. But he exaggeratedwhen he described them as military commanders. The current active leadership has not spoken out against Trump.",0.5,0.5,1,0.5,0,0.5,0.5,1,0.5,Mostly False

Final Rating: Mostly False  ",The Federal Reserve system has presided over about a 95... percent decline in the U.S. dollar.,"The dollar ain't what it used to be, and State Board of Education member Barbara Cargill wants Texas students to know it. The board hammered out more than 300 proposed changes to the state's social studies curriculum in its January and March meetings, among them revisions to an economics course that touches on the role of the Federal Reserve in establishing monetary policy. Cargill, a former science teacher from The Woodlands near Houston, proposed an amendment requiring students to analyze the decline in the U.S. dollar since the inception of the Federal Reserve system in 1913. When Gail Lowe, the board chair, asked Cargill if she'd like to speak to her amendment at the March 11 meeting, Cargill said: Well, I think it stands for itself. The Federal Reserve system has presided over a 95... percent decline in the U.S. dollar. Board member Patricia Hardy questioned Cargill's statement: It's amazing how this board knows so much about so many different subjects but I think this is innately biased in its statement and there would be lots of economists who would have a question on the role in this way. Another board member, Mavis Knight, asked: Is the Federal Reserve System the only reason why there has been a decline in the U.S. dollar since 1913? We wondered the same thing. In search of an answer, we first delved into the Fed's history. On Dec. 23, 1913, Congress created the the Federal Reserve System to serve as the nation's central bank. Its primary responsibility is to influence the flow of money and credit in the economy, returning all excess earnings to the U.S. Treasury. Currently, the system's seven board members, including Chairman Ben Bernanke, are responsible for U.S. monetary policy. They constitute a majority of the 12-member Federal Open Market Committee, which makes decisions affecting the cost and availability of money and credit. But does that mean the Fed is responsible for the dollar's decline in value over 90-plus years? Cargill didn't respond to our inquiries. (Board members wound up approving a revision of her amendment stating: Analyze the decline in value of the U.S. dollar including abandonment of the gold standard.) Meanwhile, Dan Hamermesh, an economist at the University of Texas at Austin, called Cargill's connection between the Federal Reserve and the declining dollar propaganda that ignores the impact of inflation from 1913 to 2010. The buying power of a dollar in 1913 would be almost $22 today, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics' Consumer Price Index inflation calculator. That matches up with Cargill's claim that the dollar has dropped in value by 95 percent. Then again, annual income per person is about $32,000 today, compared to about $400 in 1913 ($8,757 in 2010 dollars) — a hefty increase in earning power. Barry Bosworth, an economist at the left-leaning Brookings Institute, similarly said the Federal Reserve isn't responsible for the U.S. dollar's value, which he called pretty constant relative to other currencies. The decline in the value of the dollar is the result of inflation, but advocates of the gold standard may argue that it could have been avoided if the U.S. had stayed on the gold standard, so they blame the Federal Reserve Bank, Bosworth said. The value of U.S. dollar was tied to gold until 1973, when the United States, switched from a system of fixed exchange rates to floating rates. In simple terms, inflation is when the price of goods and services rises and buying power erodes. Do Federal Reserve critics blame the Fed for that, too? Jesse Benton, a spokesman for Rep. Ron Paul, R-Lake Jackson, said the congressman agrees with Cargill's claim. Benton said that Paul, a former Libertarian candidate, believes inflation is caused by increases in the money supply — which the Fed controls — rather than prices going up. Dollar-driven inflation (then) causes a rise in prices, Benton said. We think that it's very important to keep that in mind. Robert Auerbach, a professor of public affairs at the University of Texas, former banking committee investigator and author of the book, Deception and Abuse at the Fed: Henry B. Gonzalez Battles Alan Greenspan's Bank, told us Cargill's amendment was misleading because it oversimplified both the dollar's and the Federal Reserve's history. Auerbach was trained by Nobel Prize-winning economist Milton Friedman, one of two free-market economists who board members recently voted to add to the state's curriculum. In his career, Friedman famously championed killing inflation by keeping the supply of money growing at a steady but slow pace, though he later backed off that view, Auerbach said. Monetary policy offers two basic choices, Auerbach said: Letting the money supply grow, fueling inflation, or keeping the reins tight, which can cause severe recessions. If you're limited from printing money, you'd put a huge number of people out of work, he said. Upshot: Cargill's correct that a dollar now has about 5 percent of the buying power it did in 1913, when the Federal Reserve System was created. That's basic math. Yet while a dollar now buys far less than in 1913, Americans also have far more earning power. And the dollar has generally held its value compared to other countries' currencies. The thrust of Cargill's statement is that the Fed presided over, or caused, that decline in value. In contrast, most experts we spoke with trace the decline to inflation over the years rather than specific actions by the Federal Reserve Bank. Though some Federal Reserve critics echo Cargill's point, such debates are best left to the economic experts who have waged them for decades.

Final Rating: Mostly False  ",Says Washington's reach extends to even telling us what kind of light bulb we can use.,"No duh, Gov. Rick Perry has a thing against things from Washington. His new book, Fed Up! Our Fight to Save America from Washington, brims with what-the-hey statements about whassup in our nation's capital including a declaration that lit us up.Saying there's no end to the reach of Washington, Perry writes that Washington is even telling us what kind of light bulb we can use.We asked Perry for backup on that claim and didn't hear back. Then we launched a search for use-this-bulb regulations.What we found: In 2007, Congress voted to improve the efficiency of light bulbs. President George W. Bush signed into law the Energy Independence and Security Act, which set energy efficiency standards for kinds of incandescent lamps (light bulbs), incandescent reflector lamps (like track lighting in your kitchen), and fluorescent lamps, according to a December 2007 summary by the Congressional Research Service. With a few exceptions, the law also prohibits the U.S Coast Guard from purchasing incandescent light bulbs for use in Coast Guard office buildings.Barack Obama, Bush's successor, promised while running for president to to sign a measure into law that begins to phase out all incandescent light bulbs. He said the change would save Americans $6 billion a year on their electric bills. Last year, PolitiFact reported that no such proposal was made it into law, though in June 2009 Obama announced changes in lighting standards. Starting in August 2012, fluorescent tube lamps (most commonly found in offices and stores) and conventional incandescent reflector lamps must become more efficient. The government said such fluorescent and incandescent lamps represented approximately 38 percent and 7 percent, respectively, of total lighting energy use.Our search for instances of the government directing which bulbs residents can use unearthed a June 2010 editorial in the Washington Times objecting to Federal Trade Commission-issued regulations of light-bulb labels. The editorial says the regs were ordered by Congress as part of its 2007 decision to force the more efficient, curlicue-shaped compact fluorescent light bulb on a public that so far has refused to embrace it willingly. Beginning Jan. 1, 2012, the editorial says, bureaucratic rules will phase in, and conventional 100-watt bulbs will be first on the contraband list.Make sense?Jen Stutsman, spokeswoman for the U.S. Department of Energy, told us that conventional incandescent bulbs are not expected to meet the efficiency standards Congress set, though the government expects manufacturers to improve incandescent technologies to meet the higher standards or consumers will move to compact fluorescent light bulbs, LED technologies or halogens. She said new standards for 100-watt bulbs take effect in January 2012. New standards for 75-watt bulbs start in 2013 and standards for 60- and 40-watt bulbs start in 2014.Stutsman said the expected shifts aren't equivalent to the government telling Americans which light bulbs to use. Under no circumstances does it say that a consumer must purchase a specific type of light bulb, Stutsman said.Finally, we sought advice from the Dallas-based American Lighting Association, a trade group whose director of engineering and technology, Terry McGowan, said in an e-mail that it's a stretch to say federal laws are telling us what light bulb to buy. Federal law is requiring that household light bulbs be made more efficient in steps over time as a nationwide energy-saving measure. It's like saying that new cars will have to deliver more miles/gallon. Maybe some people would say that's mandating what kind of car to buy; but that's an interpretation — especially if many cars on the market can meet the miles/gallon requirement, McGowan said.There will still be household light bulbs available, McGowan's e-mail says, noting later that special-purpose bulbs used in appliances or for decorative purposes are exempted. One thing is for sure; what we use for lighting our homes will take some thought — and maybe we'll be changing what we decide to do.So, is Washington telling us what kind of bulb to use?Not yet, though the 2007 law steps up efficiency requirements and that's expected to result in consumers purchasing and using different bulbs. These factors give Perry's statement an element of truth. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published.

Final Rating: Mostly True  ",SaySean Hannity said in 2008 that Obamas willingness to meet with North Korea was disturbingwhile Trumps willingness to meet with North Korea is a huge foreign policy win.,"An image shared widely on Facebook and Reddit chides Fox News host Sean Hannity for having a double standard on presidents talking to North Korea. It says that in 2008 Hannity said that President Barack Obamas willingness to meet with North Korea is one of the most disturbing displays of Obamas lack of foreign policy experience. But in 2018, Hannity said President Donald Trumps willingness to meet with North Korea is a huge foreign policy win.  We hit the transcripts and video files. For the most part, those words accurately reflect what Hannity said. A week before Election Day 2008, Hannity gave 10 reasons not to vote for Obama. No. 2 on his list concerned talking to unfriendly regimes. One of the most disturbing displays of Obama's lack of foreign policy expertise came during last year's YouTube debate, Hannity said Oct. 26, 2008. The junior senator from Illinois gave what many called a naive answer for a question from the audience about whether he would meet with the leaders of Syria, Venezuela, Cuba or North Korea without preconditions. Asked during that debate if he would be willing to meet with those leaders without preconditions, Obama said I would, and compared that to previous presidents. Ronald Reagan and Democratic presidents like JFK constantly spoke to the Soviet Union at a time when Ronald Reagan called them an evil empire, Obama said. And the reason is because they understood that we may not trust them and they may pose an extraordinary danger to this country, but we had the obligation to find areas where we can potentially move forward. The image mentioned only North Korea, while Hannity listed several countries. When news broke that Trump was open to meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, Hannity voiced support. A huge foreign policy win for President Trump, Hannity said March 8. Little Rocket Man blinks. Now, the presidents tough rhetoric, his bold action, his severe sanctions, they appear to be working tonight. President Trump is accepting an invitation to meet with the North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un by May, and Pyongyang is agreeing to stop all nuclear and missile tests while these talks are underway. And the sanctions? They will continue. So the text in the image matches what Hannity said. But his criticism of Obama and his praise for Trump came in the context of different policies. Obamas policy on North Korea grew more complicated over time. But initially, it was fairly simple, said Penn State international affairs professor Joseph DeThomas. Preconditions meant that in order for talks to happen, North Korea had to agree that the purpose was the complete denuclearization of North Korea. During the campaign and early in his term Obama was very open to talks without preconditions, DeThomas said. For Trump, the picture is murkier. When Trump tweeted that he would meet with Kim Jong Un, North Korea had not taken any steps toward denuclearization. He said they had talked about it. Kim Jong Un talked about denuclearization with the South Korean representatives, not just a freeze, Trump wrote. Also, no missile testing by North Korea during this period of time. Kim Jong Un talked about denuclearization with the South Korean Representatives, not just a freeze. Also, no missile testing by North Korea during this period of time. Great progress being made but sanctions will remain until an agreement is reached. Meeting being planned! But for North Korea, denuclearization applies to the entire peninsula, which has implications for the American presence and military posture in South Korea. That is not the same as simply agreeing to a North Korea without nukes. DeThomas said testing halts are customary during talks with North Korea. Beyond that, North Korea made no concessions or took any steps toward ending its nuclear program. Trump has imposed stricter sanctions and has been more ready to hint at using military force against North Korea. But in terms of having direct talks between the leaders of both nations, DeThomas said this administration set a lower bar than what previous presidents have demanded. The Trump precondition for talks was that North Korea had to halt nuclear and missile testing for some unspecified period of time prior to commencement of talks, DeThomas said.  In February, Vice President Mike Pence drew headlines when he said sanctions and direct talks could happen at the same time. To some observers, that meant the administration was willing to talk without the precondition of North Korea agreeing to a future free of nukes. DeThomas characterized such words as loosey goosey, but not indicative of a major change. In that regard, when Hannity praised Trump, the administrations overall policy was tougher than what Obama had articulated when he ran for president. But the fact remains that Trump had agreed to a meeting before North Korea had taken any concrete steps toward ridding itself of nuclear weapons. The side-by-side quotes cast Hannity as criticizing Obama for being willing to talk to North Korea while praising Trump for his willingness to do the same thing. The quotations are pretty much accurate. But the image glosses over the different policy preferences of each man at the time Hannity spoke. In 2008, Obama said simply there were no preconditions for a meeting with the leader. In 2018, Trumps administration voiced some relaxation on preconditions, but not a full rejection of them. At the same time, Trump agreed to a meeting before North Korea had done more than agree to hold off on testing during any talks.",1.0,0.5,1.0,0.8,0.3,0.4,0.6,1.0,0.5,Mostly True

Lets take a ride in search of the truth.The list for the 10-county Atlanta region contains 157 projects, according to the Atlanta Regional Commission, which provided data and analysis to officials involved in putting together the list.The Sierra Club sent PolitiFact Georgia a spreadsheet with about 70 projects that would increase the number of lanes of some roads or make them longer. Some of the road projects on the list include: The road projects would increase capacity by 367 miles, ARC says.By comparison, there are three confirmed light-rail projects on the list: along the Atlanta Beltline, the Atlanta streetcar and a line on Clifton Corridor from the Lindbergh Center in Atlanta to Emory University in DeKalb County. A proposed rail line from Cobb County to Midtown Atlanta would need federal funding and is not currently considered a light-rail project.The referendums supporters say the lack of light or heavy rail in the plan is not a lack of will, but a matter of math. The light rail on the Beltline and Clifton Corridor is expected to cost about $1.3 billion, or about $60 million a mile. The referendum is projected to raise about $8.5 billion over the life span of the tax, 10 years.Jane Hayse, ARCs transportation division chief, said the light-rail projects are 21 miles combined.So what about the Sierra Clubs calculation of a 16-to-1 ratio of road projects to light rail? According to ARC, there are 17.5 miles of increased road capacity in the plan for each mile of proposed light rail.Mathematically, it is accurate, Hayse told us. However, the comparison is erroneous. It compares apples to bananas.Hayse said in order to fairly fact-check the Sierra Clubs claim, you must consider all the additional bus projects in the plan. The list includes express bus service in portions of the region and $100 million for bus service in Clayton County, which ended its bus operations a few years ago due to budget cuts. In all, ARC said there is an additional 371 miles of bus service on the list.ARC spokesman Jim Jaquish said the organization will not take a position on the referendum because it is a nonprofit that receives taxpayer dollars. Jaquish did say ARC believes the list is made up of sound, needed projects.Hayse said express bus service is more logical for some parts of the Atlanta suburbs because people do not live and work as closely together as they do in the city. Hayse said rail stations are typically three miles apart, whereas express bus service has longer distances between stops.Light rail just doesnt make sense for the whole region, she said.Kiernan countered that bus service is not a sure thing, noting that Clayton Countys bus service, C-Tran, was discontinued.Our argument is that the amount of fixed, permanent transit infrastructure that we know will be built by the tax is overwhelmed by the amount of fixed road infrastructure we know will be built, Kiernan wrote via email. Traditional express and local bus service is a completely different animal ... and the suggestion that miles of bus service is somehow equivalent to miles of permanent fixed-guideway infrastructure is highly misleading.Kiernans claim is essentially correct. But it needs a bit of context to move higher on the Truth-O-Meter.Under our rating system, Kiernan gets a Mostly True.",1.0,0.5,1.0,0.8,0.0,0.3,0.4,1.0,0.7,Mostly True

Final Rating: Mostly True",Took on the Olympics and turned them around,"In February 1999, Romney was called on to help bail out an Olympic effort that was marred by scandal. Sponsors wondered if they still wanted their names attached to the Games after it was revealed that Salt Lake City's host committee had showered gifts on the international group that had chosen the location. Investigations were underway. The Olympics were in serious trouble. Still, Romney's implication that he single-handedly rescued the Games is a sore subject in Utah. Robert Garff, chairman of the Salt Lake organizing committee and a supporter of Romney's presidential bid, says Romney's commercial does overstate the problem. Garff says that contrary to Romney's ad, the Olympics were not bankrupt before he arrived. In addition, many of the Games' sponsors predated Romney's involvement, said Sydney Fonnesbeck, a former member of the Salt Lake City Council. He just came in and gathered the money that was already (pledged), she said. Fonnesbeck said Romney alienated some people with whom he worked during the Games. He didn't want to give anyone else any credit, she said. We became nobodies. A lot of us were hurt and angry. It didn't surprise any of us when he ran home and ran for governor. And yet, Romney did play a decisive role in righting the troubled Olympics. Richard Pound, a Montreal attorney and a member of the International Olympic Committee, said someone had to take charge and make decisions or the Games would have been a disaster. That's what Romney did. There were good people in the organization, but for them to have been able to do the many things that needed to be done, they needed a good leader who could make decisions and empower them, Pound said. Romney scored a big win early in his effort to preserve the Olympic luster by helping to convince John Hancock to remain a sponsor. Stephen A. Greyser, a professor emeritus at the Harvard Business School and a specialist in sports marketing, said the Olympic brand itself had been at stake. It was Mitt Romney who was, in essence, Mr. Integrity, Greyser said. In the end, we cannot award a fully True ruling to Romney's claim when even his supporters say his claim is a little overstated. But there is nothing to dispute that Romney played a vital role in rescuing a very troubled Olympic games and that's why we're rating his claim Mostly True.",0.7,0.5,0.9,0.5,0.3,0.4,0.6,0.8,0.6,Mostly True

Final Rating: Mostly True  ",Says a Republican-drawn map of proposed U.S. House districts for Texas gerrymanders more than nine million Latinos in Texas to make sure that we have no more electoral opportunity than we did in 1991.,"A lawyer viewing a proposed Republican redo of congressional districts laid out in late May saw no additional gains for Hispanic representation even though 65 percent of the state's growth over the past decade was comprised of Latinos.Nina Perales, vice president of litigation for the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund, said in a May 31 press release that the map just unveiled by Republican legislators gerrymanders more than nine million Latinos in Texas to make sure that we have no more electoral opportunity than we did in 1991.Thats a heavy charge considering Latino population growth has been key to the state gaining six U.S. House seats since the 2000 census.Is MALDEFs claim accurate?Lets start with a dash of law and a 20-year flashback.As noted in a February draft report by the Texas Legislative Council, U.S. Supreme Court decisions bar any state from drawing congressional districts intentionally diluting the voting strength of members of a racial or ethnic minority group.The Voting Rights Act of 1965, amended in 1982, is the most important law protecting the voting rights of racial and ethnic minority groups, the report says, because of provisions requiring certain jurisdictions, including Texas, to obtain prior federal approval of any redistricting plan. The act also allows members of a racial or language minority group to challenge a plan limiting or diminishing their opportunity to participate in elections and to elect candidates of their choice.Redistricting expert Justin Levitt, a professor at Loyola Law School, told us the court has interpreted the act to mean jurisdictions must protect the voting power of a group of racial and ethnic minorities if its large enough, compact enough and cohesive enough--and would not be able to exercise political power if the electoral process was left to its own devices.Now, the flashback: Lawmakers in 1991 designed two of three added House districts as opportunity districts giving Latino voters a good shot at electing candidates of their choice. Frank Tejeda, a Democratic state senator, then captured the San Antonio-rooted 28th district, while voters in Houstons 29th district advanced another senator, Democrat Gene Green.Texas wound up with seven Latino-opportunity districts, a number that did not change after last decades redistricting.How do those opportunity districts shake out under the map offered in May?For starters, the map breaks up the state into 36 districts, counting four districts gained courtesy of population increases this past decade. Two new districts, one in the Houston area, the other in Dallas-Fort Worth, are not considered minority-opportunity districts.Another, the 34th district, stretches from Brownsville in Cameron County to Hidalgo County north toward Corpus Christi and is 82 percent Hispanic. But observers do not view the district as a Latino-opportunity gain; its a swap for the current Latino-opportunity district rooted in Corpus Christi and carried in 2010 by Republican Blake Farenthold.Then again, the remap includes the new 35th district running from East Austin into San Antonio. Its overall population is 63 percent Hispanic, according to information compiled by the legislative council; 45 percent of its 2010 registered voters had Spanish surnames. Perales told us Latino voters could elect the candidate of their choice in the district.This appears to give the state an additional Latino-opportunity district compared with 1991.Not so, Perales said, because its offset by redraws of San Antonios 20th district and the 23rd district stretching west from San Antonio that dilute Latino voting power.Among factors she aired: The share of Spanish-surnamed voters in the 20th district, which is represented by Charlie Gonzalez, would drop from 58 percent now to 49 percent. In the 23rd district, where Democrat Rick Noriega bested GOP U.S. Sen. John Cornyn in 2008, Cornyn prevails in the redrawn version.If you create a new opportunity and you take away an opportunity, theres no net gain, Perales said.State Sen. Kel Seliger, R-Amarillo, who chairs the Senate Redistricting Committee, told us lawmakers had to shift Hispanic residents from Gonzalezs district to ensure the new Austin-to-San Antonio district would be a Latino-opportunity district. He urged us to visit further with Austin lawyer Bob Heath, an adviser to the committee.Heath said its hard for legislators to create more Latino-opportunity districts because the Hispanic population is younger than the rest of Texas, and its proportionate share of voting-age residents is smaller. He said too that such residents arent always geographically concentrated and Latino voter registration and turnout tends to run low in part because there are more Latino non-citizens than in other subgroups.Heath said that in his opinion, he said, the 20th district is always going to elect an Hispanic in the Democratic primary and the Democrat is going to win. He declined to comment on the 23rd district.No doubt, appraising opportunity districts is tricky. This is why political scientists get paid every 10 years, for taking all the factors into account and judging districts, Levitt said. Its nuanced.Its also subject to legal argument. Courts have been asked to judge the redo of congressional districts that ultimately won legislative approval.Our judgment: If MALDEFs characterizations stick, the May remap promised six to seven Latino-opportunity districts -- at best the same as 1991.But if Republican defenders are correct, the remap offers eight Latino-opportunity districts--a one-seat bump. However, the proportion of Latino-opportunity seats circa 2012--22 percent--would be virtually unchanged in 20 years. Thats because greatly Latino population growth has helped Texas edge to 36 total seats, compared to 30 in 1991.",0.8,0.5,0.9,0.6,0.5,0.4,0.5,0.7,0.6,Mostly True

Final Rating: Mostly True  ",Almost 75 percent of the deaths from COVID-19 in the state of Texas are a result of people contracting COVID-19 who are age 65 and older.,"In a press conference on May 5 in which Gov. Greg Abbott updated his reopening plan to add businesses such as hair salons and gyms, he recommended that at-risk populations remain at home if at all possible and avoid in-person gatherings, such as a church service, funeral or wedding. We strongly encourage at-risk populations to try to watch or participate remotely, remembering this very important point, and that is almost 75 percent of the deaths from COVID-19 in the state of Texas are a result of people contracting COVID-19 who are age 65 and older, Abbott said. Texas was among the first states to start reopening businesses and lifting restrictions put in place to curb the spread of the coronavirus, allowing retail stores and restaurants to open May 1 at 25 percent capacity. Abbott announced the latest set of reopenings Monday, expanding restaurant capacity to 50 percent and granting bars the ability to open at 25 percent capacity within the next couple weeks. This comes as the state continues to see its number of infections and deaths rise and clusters form mostly in rural parts of the state where meatpacking plants are located. Hospitalizations, however, have decreased since mid-April. With that in mind, we had to ask: Is Abbott right that almost 75% of coronavirus deaths in Texas are people older than 65? Looking at the numbers Abbotts spokesman John Wittman said Abbotts claim is based on figures from the Texas Department of Health Services, which publishes daily numbers on the states COVID-19 testing and cases. The data includes a breakdown of coronavirus deaths by age, race and gender, but only for those cases where the deaths have been investigated by the local and regional health departments. As of Wednesday, the majority, or 489, were still under investigation. The demographic data on cases and fatalities come from the case investigation forms submitted by local health departments and our regional offices, said DSHS spokesman Chris Van Deusen. The purpose of the investigation is to confirm that the person had COVID-19 but also to collect other details about them and the circumstances around their death, Van Deusen said. Wittman said the data showed that 75% of investigated deaths were people 65 and older when Abbott made this statement. It alternates almost daily, but its generally around that range, Wittman said. As of May 6, the day after the press conference, the death toll in Texas was 948. Fewer than half, or 433, had been investigated. Of those, about 71 percent were Texans 65 and older. It was still about 71 percent, or 345 out of 489 investigated cases, as of Wednesday. The age groups broke down like so: Ages 10 to 19 years old: 2 deaths, or 0.4% Ages 20-29: 10 deaths, or 2.04 % Ages 30-39: 9 deaths, or 1.8% Ages 40-49: 21 deaths, or 4.29% Ages 50-59: 54 deaths, or 11.04% Ages 60-64: 45 deaths, or 9.2% Ages 65-69: 59 deaths, or 12.06% Ages 70-74: 45 deaths, or 9.2% Ages 75-79: 45 deaths, or 9.2% Ages 80+: 196 deaths, or 40.08% Across the United States, about 79% of coronavirus deaths have been people 65 years and older, according to the National Center for Health Statistics data submitted between the beginning of February to the beginning of May. Like Texas statistics, the national numbers are also incomplete. The number of deaths represent only those entered between those dates and only include people with confirmed or presumed COVID-19. While 80% of deaths are electronically processed and coded by NCHS within minutes, most deaths from COVID-19 must be coded by a person, which takes an average of 7 days, the NCHS states on its website. The data is also always somewhat behind because of the lag time between when a death occurred and when a death certificate is completed, submitted to NCHS and processed for reporting purposes. The delay can last anywhere from one week to eight or more. Our ruling Abbott said almost 75 percent of the deaths from COVID-19 in the state of Texas are a result of people contracting COVID-19 who are age 65 and older. Of confirmed coronavirus deaths, close to 75% were people within the age group Abbott provided, but he failed to include the caveat that this statistic leaves out more than half of the total deaths that have not yet been investigated.",0.8,0.4,1.0,0.6,0.0,0.2,0.5,1.0,0.4,Mostly True

Final Rating: Mostly True  ","At Twin River, we're more than competitive with nearby casinos in slot machine payouts.","Earlier this month, Gov. Lincoln Chafee expressed the fear that trying to cull too much revenue from the state's slot parlors could send gamblers to other states, where the odds might be better.They are not going to play if they are going to keep losing, Chafee said. They'll go across the border, or go somewhere else where the odds, if you will, are more in their favor.  They know where they have a better chance of winning.In response, Patti Doyle, spokeswoman for Twin River, one of Rhode Islands two slot parlors, said in a radio interview that her casino gives better odds.We know from the industry standards in the industry casino world, that we're all pretty much on the same level. You know, you wouldn't be able to continue to be in business if you weren't competitive with gaming venues that are nearby. And we are. We're more than competitive, she said on radio station WPRO (630-AM).When we hear more than competitive, we think better.So we asked Doyle for the source of that comparison. While we awaited her response, we started our own research.On its website, RILot.com, the Rhode Island Lottery publishes a monthly list of how much cash was put into Twin Rivers 4,700 slot machines, how much cash was won, and how much that represents in percentage.(It should be noted that neither Twin River, nor Newport Grand, the states other slot parlor, sets the payout percentages of their slot machines. Theyre set by the director of the Rhode Island Lottery, Gerald S. Aubin.)Statistics for Connecticut's two casinos -- Foxwoods Resort Casino and Mohegan Sun -- are on the website of the Connecticut Division of Special Revenue at CT.gov/DOSR.At first glance, it looks like Rhode Island is less than competitive. During the period from January 2010 through January 2011, the highest monthly Twin River payout to gamblers was 91.529 percent, in December. The highest payout percentage at the Newport Grand, was lower: 91.171 percent in September.In contrast, the payouts at Foxwoods are listed as higher for 11 of the last 12 months. And Mohegan Sun offered a bigger payout every month, going no lower than 91.80 percent last May and as high as 92.17 in August.But George Papanier, CEO of Twin River, said the published percentages aren't comparable because states calculate the payout percentage differently.The issue is the credits that players get, also known as free play. Rhode Island calls it Bonus Play. Mohegan lists it as eBonus Credits. In the Foxwoods report it's called Free Play. The two states account for it differently, said Papanier. Officials at the Rhode Island Lottery told us the same thing.As a result, the payout percentage for Foxwoods and Mohegan Sun is inflated, they said.In order to calculate the Cash Won at each Connecticut casino the same way it is calculated in Rhode Island, you must take the handle  (the amount played, including free play and winnings replayed), subtract the Win amount (how much the casino wins) and subtract the value of the Free Play or eBonus coupons redeemed at the slot machines.By that formula, we discovered that, as Doyle said, Twin Rivers payout percentage is better than Foxwoods. In every month over the past year, Twin River had a higher payout percentage. The one-year averages: 91.366 percent for Twin River and 90.768 percent for Foxwoods.The story is a little different for Mohegan Sun. It beat out Twin River in 7 of the past 12 months, but the Connecticut casino's 12-month average was a hair below Twin River's, at 91.359 percent. A few tenths -- or hundredths -- of a percent may not seem consequential, but to serious gamblers, any tilt in their advantage is attractive, maybe even enough to send them to one casino over another.To double-check our numbers, we talked to Michael Janusko, chief financial examiner of Connecticut's Division of Special Revenue, who confirmed that our calculations were correct. The way Foxwoods and Mohegan Sun run their numbers, it does overstate the payout percentage a bit, he said.Finally, Doyle sent us a copy of The Gaming Industry Observer's East Coast Slot Report that summarizes casino operations from Maine to Florida in January. Twin River ranked 13th out of 56 facilities in terms of money paid out to players, ahead of Mohegan Sun (25th), Newport Grand (26th), and Foxwoods (35th).Aubin, Rhode Island's Lottery director, said there is an important caveat to understand when considering payout. Those percentages are largely a function of the types of machines a casino has, not whether it is actually giving gamblers better odds.All other things being equal, a facility that has lots of penny slots, for example, will have a lower overall payout percentage than a casino that has none because those machines have smaller payouts.I'm confident it would be the exact same payout throughout the country with the same game, he said.To summarize: Looking at the casinos as a whole, the way Foxwoods and Mohegan Sun calculate their payout percentages may make them look like a better bet for gamblers. But if you include player rewards to make an apples-to-apples comparison, Doyle's statement that Twin River is more than competitive is true for Foxwoods. Whether it applies to Mohegan Sun depends on the month.",1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.5,1.0,1.0,Mostly True

Final Rating: Mostly True  ","Under economic sanctions, now Iran is suffering 30 percent inflation, 20 percent unemployment.","An Iranian president says hes ready to resolve the nations nuclear standoff with the West — what gives? Former U.S. Labor Secretary Robert Reich gives at least partial credit to economic pain orchestrated by the United States and international allies. While the United States must still be very cautious, he said on ABCs This Week, one of the big lessons here is that economic sanctions do seem to work. Right now Iran is suffering 30 percent inflation, 20 percent unemployment, he told a roundtable including CNNs Newt Gingrich, ABCs Jonathan Karl and PBS Gwen Ifill. I mean this nation is hurting and our economic sanctions, because we've been patient with them, because we have actually rounded up almost every other nation to support us, have had a huge impact. Is Iran suffering such high inflation and unemployment under economic sanctions? Tumbling oil exports Now, economic sanctions are nothing new for Iran, which has faced U.S. sanctions since its 1979 Islamic revolution. But the pressure hasbeen rising. Other nations have joined in sanctions since 2006 in response to Irans efforts to develop a nuclear weapon, according to a report byKenneth Katzman of the Congressional Research Service, which provides nonpartisan analysis to Congress. Oil exports, which fund nearly half of Irans government spending, have fallen by about half since 2011, from about 2.5 million barrels a day to about 1.25 million. The drop hasbeen driven, Katzman says, by a European Union embargo and U.S. pressure on Iranian oil customers. Iran also lost access to the international banking system. The combination has caused a sharp drop in the value of Irans currency, the rial, Katzman says. Meanwhile, sanctions helped trigger a recession thats driving up unemployment. Has that meant 30 percent inflation, 20 percent unemployment, as Reich told ABC viewers? Theres not a simple answer. Inflation estimates range from 30 percent to 70 percent. Official unemployment statistics, meanwhile, are out of date, and outside experts question their accuracy, anyway. The International Monetary Fund, World Bank and Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development dont have up-to-date figures for Iranian unemployment. Still, Reichs in range. Gary Hufbauer, a former U.S. Treasury official and senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics who has studied sanctions for 30 years, said Reichs numbers seem reasonable. Heres how the Congressional Research Service put it in June: Inflation: 30 percent plus, according to Iran Central Bank in May 2013, but believed to be over 50 percent by outside experts. Unemployment rate: Official rate is 15.3 percent as of the end of 2011, but outside experts believe the rate is higher. Reich pointed us to news articles from the Associated Press and energy news site OilPrice.com — which offer some support for his numbers while highlighting the uncertainty. The Associated Press reported in June inflation over 30 percent, though it cited a 14 percent unemployment rate. OilPrices.com noted Sept. 19 that analysts outside the countryfound thatunemployment rate impossible to believe, and quoted an estimate from Mehrdad Emadi, an Iranian-born economic adviser to the European Union, of more than 20 percent. (The OilPrices.com report echoes a Reuters report from the same day.) So reasonable seems like a fair assessment for Reichs numbers. We should also note theres not universal agreement on the size of sanctions role in all that financial pain, which experts also attribute to Irans fiscal management. Reich, a professor of public policy at the University of California at Berkeley with a background in economics, told PolitiFact it just makes sense unemployment and inflation would follow a slash in oil exports. The typical consequence for a nation dependent on exports when those exports are cut is high inflation and high unemployment, he said. Michael Malloy, a professor at the University of the Pacifics McGeorge School of Law who specializes in banking regulation and economic sanctions, told PolitiFact it's likely to be a much more complicated picture. Our ruling Reich told ABC viewers that under economic sanctions, now Iran is suffering 30 percent inflation and 20 percent unemployment. Irans own statistics arent widely trusted and international organizations dont have recent unemployment figures. But those numbers fall within a broad range of expert estimates cited by news reports and the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service. Its worth noting that Irans economic struggle has been exacerbated by its own economic policies and other factors, not just sanctions. Still, theres good evidence theyve had a huge impact, as Reich said.",0.8,0.2,1.0,0.7,0.0,0.1,0.5,0.9,0.6,Mostly True

Final Rating: Mostly True  ",U.S. Sen. Johnny Isakson has voted for $7 trillion of our national debt!,"Libertarian U.S. Senate candidate Allen Buckley knows he faces an uphill battle in his campaign to unseat Republican U.S. Sen. Johnny Isakson. Libertarians usually pull only low single-digits of the overall Georgia voter turnout. And Isakson is a veteran lawmaker and a founding member of the state Republican establishment, which today holds sway over all statewide offices. Buckley ran unsuccessful campaigns for U.S. Senate in 2004 and 2008. But in 2008, he won enough votes in the general election to force a runoff between Republican Saxby Chambliss and Democrat Jim Martin. An Atlanta tax attorney, Buckley thinks he has an issue that will resonate with voters if he can only get them to pay attention and understand the gravitas of the soaring federal debt. U.S. Sen. Johnny Isakson has voted for $7 trillion of our national debt! Buckley states on his website as part of a graphic about Isakson votes to raise the federal debt limit. Is that possible? Has Isakson, who has pushed for a balanced budget amendment and who also blasts the federal debt on his campaign website, actually assisted the spending spree? PolitiFact Georgia decided to take a look. Buckley and Democrat Jim Barksdale will face Isakson in the November election. We first contacted Buckley, who said the graphic refers to Isaksons repeated votes to raise the federal debt limit, which essentially means raising the cap on what the government is permitted to spend to pay the bills. I believe Mr. Isakson has, irresponsibly and immorally, voted to grow the federal government through debt spending to the detriment of young people and our country. Buckley said in an email. He later added: He largely created the mess and then voted to fund what he created. Buckley said Isakson voted for debt-bloating items like the war in Iraq and the Medicare prescription drug benefit and subsequently voted for debt-ceiling increases to cover the cost of the increased spending. Isaksons campaign manager, Trey Kilpatrick, dismissed Buckley assertions, but did not dispute Isaksons vote to raise the debt limit. Mr. Buckley is trying to mislead voters by citing debt ceiling votes (required for solvency) without citing Johnny's votes against trillions of dollars in unnecessary spending, including voting against a minimum of $5 trillion in debt ceiling votes alone, or his vote for the Budget Control Act, which cut spending by over $2 trillion and, according to the Heritage Foundation, 'has shrunk the size of government more effectively than any budget tool in a generation, Kilpatrick wrote in an email. The debate over the federal debt comes at an interesting time. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office earlier this month released a report that warned of vastly increased federal debt when compared to the Gross Domestic Product over the next three decades. Federal debt held by the public was 39 percent of GDP in 2008, but is now about 75 percent, the budget office said. That could rise to 86 percent by 2026 and a whopping 141 percent by 2046. The prospect of such large debt poses substantial risks for the nation and presents policymakers with significant challenges, the budget office warned. The CBO said the governments spending growth is outpacing revenues as spending soars for popular programs like Social Security and Medicare and interest on the governments existing debt. The most popular programs cost a lot to maintain, and neither Democrats nor Republicans want to be blamed for cuts, experts told PolitiFact. PolitiFact consulted political and budget experts across the county. Their verdict: Buckley has a point about Isaksons spending votes, but there is a lot of context missing. University of Virginia political scientist Larry Sabato said many of the most popular federal programs are also the most expensive. That puts politicians of all stripes in a difficult spot. Some, like Social Security, Medicare/Medicaid, Defense spending, interest on the debt etc. are bigger than others, Sabato said. Given that many of these categories are mandatory, its hard to imagine that any member of Congress hasnt cast votes that effectively increase the amount of debt the country incurs. Chris Edwards, an economist with the Cato Institute, said that by voting for debt-limit increases members of Congress have kicked the can down the road on the governments debt problem. Voting for annual deficit-financed budgets causes the accumulated debt to rise, but voting to increase the legal debt limit—as Isakson and others do regularly—ratifies the unsound practice of endlessly spending more than is taken in, Edwards wrote in an email. Kennesaw State University political scientist Kerwin Swint said voting to raise the debt ceiling is not quite the same thing as voting to create new programs or authorize new spending items The alternative to not raising the debt ceiling is shutting down the government, Swint said. Buckleys claim is technically accurate of course but totally misleading, saidAlan Abramowitz, a political scientist at Emory University. Abramowitz said the U.S. should take advantage of extremely low interest rates to borrow more money to invest in much needed infrastructure improvements and other projects. It cannot be emphasized enough that the debt obsession of some conservative politicians and pundits is totally misplaced at a time when the investing community is practically begging to purchase U.S. treasury notes at extremely low interest rates, Abramowitz said.  Our ruling:  Libertarian U.S. Senate candidate Allen Buckley proclaimed on his campaign website: U.S. Sen. Johnny Isakson has voted for $7 trillion of our national debt! Isakson did indeed vote to raise the debt ceiling, so Buckley has a valid point. But the alternative would be risking a government shutdown. That said, Buckley also pointed at that Isakson voted for some of the very programs that bloated the debt in the first place.  https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/678c89f4-52af-4e46-a0c6-780d26e73caf",1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,Mostly True

Final Rating: Mostly True  ","Says under our current sentencing laws, about 75 percent of all convicted felons in Oregon do not go to prison.","Gov. John Kitzhaber recently announced the creation of a new commission to examine the states sentencing laws. Not long after, two advocacy groups released a joint report calling Oregon's Measure 11 ineffective and discriminatory when it comes to the states youth.Mandatory sentencing laws -- ever the point of contention -- are receiving renewed public attention. And in a recent guest column in The Oregonian, three county district attorneys -- including Multnomahs Michael Schrunk -- offered some context, noting this is an issue with which we have great experience and expertise.While expressing some disappointment that the governor was not including elected district attorneys on the commission, the three wrote contrary to popular belief, we do not lock up every convicted criminal. Under our current sentencing laws, about 75 percent of all convicted felons in Oregon do not go to prison. They are put on probation in the community.That statistic caught the eye of at least one reader who asked PolitiFact Oregon to take a look.The DAs said they got that figure courtesy of Oregons Criminal Justice Commission, so thats where we started.It didnt take long before Michael Wilson, the commissions economist, sent us a breakdown of felons and their sentences for 2010.At first blush, it looks like Schrunk and the other DAs -- John Foote of Clackamas and Bob Hermann of Washington -- were right. (It should be noted, nine others endorsed the letter, as well.) Of the 17,622 convicted felons in 2010, just over 4,000 were sent to prison. As a percentage, thats about 23 percent.But, as Craig Prins, the director of the justice commission put it, the simple answer isnt always the most informative answer. There are a few caveats to consider before you go shouting that number from any rooftops.For starters, that 23 percent figure doesnt include the 8 percent of felons who serve state time, but do it in local jails. Those 8 percent serve less than a year, but its still worth noting. Take that into account and at least 30 percent are serving state time -- just not necessarily in a prison.Next, it should be noted that there are different categories of felonies, and as you drill down into them, you start to notice that certain sorts of felons are more likely to receive time in a prison.Of the felons convicted of person crimes (think: robberies, assaults, sex crimes, murder and others), 43 percent go to prison, and another 3 percent spent time in a local jail. For felons convicted of property crimes, 30 percent wind up in prison and another 5 percent in local jails.The overall figure gets pushed down some by drug offenders who are sentenced to prison at a rate close to 8 percent with another 10 percent going to local jails for less than a year. The national rate for the same group is considerably higher, Prins said. In 2006, for instance, nationally drug offenders were being sent to prison about 40 percent of the time, according to a report from the Bureau of Justice Statistics.In Oregon, weve always kind of prided ourselves on the fact that, policy-wise, it does not make sense to put such people in prison, Prins said. Same goes for people who commit lower-level property crimes. Is it worth spending $30,000 to incarcerate somebody who stole $1,000? Prins asked. The priority are those who commit violent crimes.And, indeed, if you exclude drug offenders from the equation, 33 percent of convicted felons serve time in prison while 7 percent serve time in local jails for a total closer to 40 percent.Thats not to say that drug offenses arent felonies -- but its still important context, especially given that the word felony can describe a number of crimes.Theres one last bit to consider: About 69 percent of all convicted felons wind up with probation. But that doesnt mean they get off without serving any time behind bars, which seems to be an implicit part of the DAs critique when they note contrary to popular belief, we do not lock up every convicted criminal.According to Wilson, about 63 percent of the offenders who received a probation sentence in 2010 received a jail sentence as well. The average stay, he said, was just over a month.Put another way, only 25 percent of convicted felons actually manage to avoid time behind bars as part of their sentence. Even then, Charles French, a deputy district attorney with Multnomah County who deals a lot with crime statistics, said hed be surprised if those 25 percent dont serve at least some time in jail, if even a night, after their arrest.I think most people who commit felonies do serve time in jail, he said. But most of them do not serve time in prison. And, frankly, the idea of a jail sanction as a condition of probation is reformatory, in theory.Its important, he added, that the public has access to these sorts of figures, even if they require some context. I think the more information the public has, the better.As for our ruling, the DAs were very specific in their statement that 75 percent of all convicted felons in Oregon do not go to prison. Technically theyre right, but the number of felons the DAs lock up is considerable higher and thats an important piece of missing context.

Final Rating: Mostly True  ",Manufacturing wages today in America on a per-hour basis are actually a bit lower than average wages in the economy as a whole.,"Former car czar Steven Rattner, who actually hates the nickname he earned overseeing the auto bailout, is pushing back against proclamations of a flourishing American manufacturing industry. Again. Rattner wrote an eye-catching New York Times op-ed in January calling the industrys post-recession jobs gains a trickle, arguing we need to get real about the so-called renaissance partly because wages for auto workers andmanufacturersdropped far more than the average private-sector worker since the end of the recession in June 2009. He revisited some of those points in a March 30, 2014, appearance on ABCs This Week, which took a break from coverage of Russia and the missing Malaysian plane to examine the state of Made in the USA. We certainly want these kinds of advanced manufacturing jobs. But remember this, manufacturing wages today in America on a per-hour basis are actually a bit lower than average wages in the economy as a whole, he said. And what I mean by that is there are lots of really good high-paying jobs in sectors like education, like IT, like health care, service sectors that are not just entry-level jobs, they are really high-paying jobs, and this is our competitive advantage. Manufacturing jobs are typically seen as a source of higher pay for people who dont earn college degrees, and President Barack Obama put an emphasis on them in his State of the Union address. So PunditFact wondered if Rattner is right: Are per-hour wages in manufacturing a little smaller than average wages for the rest of the American economy? Rattner pointed to U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics data for average hourly earnings of production and nonsupervisory employees in the private sector, which make up about four-fifths of total private-sector employment. The most recent data for February 2014 shows the average hourly private-sector wage was $20.50. The manufacturing industry average was, as Rattner said, a bit lower at $19.43. Hourly wages are almost $3 higher for employees who produce durable goods, such as cars, phones and computers, than those who make nondurable goods, or things like food, gas and clothes. Weekly wages tell a different story, with manufacturers earning almost $122 more a week than the total worker average in February. The reason for the discrepancy between hourly and weekly wages is simple: Manufacturers work more hours. Anyone can work more hours and make more money, Rattner said. But manufacturers also earn more money an hour when you factor in supervisors. BLS data for February show average hourly earnings are $24.31 for all private-sector employees and $24.72 for manufacturing employees -- the opposite of what Rattner said. Which dataset is better? The question can incite an economists quarrel. Dean Baker, a liberal economist and co-director of the Center for Economic Policy Research, took issue with isolating a dataset that excludes supervisors, saying analysts see the distinction as arbitrary and are increasingly using the whole workforce for their research. The manufacturing industry has a lower percentage of production employees (70.1 percent) than the average for the private-sector workforce (82.7 percent), which accounts for the higher pay when usingRattner's measure, Baker said. Rattner argues viewing the data his way is more representative of the typical workers earnings without being influenced by the top of the pay scale. Another liberal economist and former Obama administration adviser, Jared Bernstein of the Center for Budget Policies and Priorities, faulted Rattner for excluding benefits on top of wages. Manufacturing workers often have benefits, he said. Another BLS source for wage data (yes, there are a lot of them) shows that when looking at total compensation (wages plus benefits), manufacturing workers earn $35.14 an hour, which is higher than the $28.44 average for careers in the service-providing industry and $29.63 for all private-sector workers in December 2013. Since it's widely believed that workers trade off benefit pay for lower wages, it's a mistake to just consider wages in this sort of comparison when you're dealing with an industry that pays benefits (as opposed to say, fast food), Bernstein said. Matthew Lavoie, National Association of Manufacturers spokesman, said 97 percent of the groups 12,000 members provide health insurance. Rattner conceded manufacturers earn more than service-industry workers when benefits are included in his New York Times column. In our interview with Rattner, he anticipated these objections to his claim. But my point remains the same: The perception that manufacturing jobs are better jobs is out of date, Rattner wrote. Note also that over the past year, per-hour wages for all industries rose by 50 cents per hour but in manufacturing, they rose by only 21 cents per hour. The trend is not manufacturing's friend, as my NYT piece pointed out. Our ruling Rattner was careful on This Week to single out data for per-hour wages when he argued manufacturers are not paid as much as the rest of workforce. His claim relies on the most recent data for production workers in the manufacturing industry, who earn about $1 less than the average of their private-sector counterparts. However, factoring in supervisors shows manufacturers make 41 cents more per hour. Adding benefits gives manufacturers more of an edge. We wont take sides and say what dataset we think is best. What we can say is that Rattner makes an accurate point by one measure.",0.8,0.3,1.0,0.7,0.1,0.4,0.5,1.0,0.6,Mostly True

Final Rating: Mostly True  ",Scott Walker cut school funding more per student than any governor in America.,"A TV ad released Aug. 28, 2014 by the Greater Wisconsin Committee, a group funded by labor unions and Democratic ideological groups, starts with three children looking into the camera and each asking: Why? Then an adult narrator says: Why did Scott Walker cut school funding more per student than any governor in America? Where did the money go? To Scott Walker's friends. Walker gave his corporate friends half a billion dollars in tax breaks and giveaways. We've already rated False an earlier Greater Wisconsin Committee claim, that Walker gave $570 million in job-development incentives to his cronies or corporate friends. Much of that money went to firms whose employees have given to Democrats in the past, many of the donations were small and Walkers jobs agency has a limited role in dealing with firms associated with a big chunk of the $570 million. But what about the claim of Walker cutting school funding, on a per-student basis, more than any other governor? What we know There's no dispute that shortly after taking office in January 2011, Walker made a dramatic reduction in school funding. The $1.2 billion in reductions included $792 million in direct state aid to kindergarten-through-12th grade schools, which is the focus of the new Greater Wisconsin Committee ad. But that fact-check didn't calculate the K-12 school cuts on a per-student basis in comparison to other states. And Walker later restored some of the state aid to schools. The committees evidence Before we dig in, a few words about wording. The Greater Wisconsin Committees claim refers to funding of public schools. But, as well see, the evidence the committee cites is overall spending by the schools -- in other words, what was spent in total from state, federal and local money. So, in addition to checking the overall spending figures the committee cited to us in support of its claim, well examine state revenue figures -- the amount of money given to public schools strictly from the state. What the Greater Wisconsin Committee cited is a table from a solid source, the latest annual report from the U.S. Census Bureau comparing all 50 states (and the District of Columbia) on public school financing. Issued in May 2014, the report covers the Wisconsin state fiscal year of 2011-12, which is the first full fiscal year during Walkers term in office. (The states fiscal year runs from July 1 through June 30; in other words, roughly the same as the traditional school year.) On a percentage basis, Wisconsins reduction in overall per-pupil spending -- of state, federal and local money -- was at the top of the chart when compared with the previous year. In terms of cuts, here are the top five:  State/District Per-pupil SPENDING in 2011-12 from ALL sources Change from 2010-11  Wisconsin $11,042 -6.2 percent Florida $8,372 -5.8 percent District of Columbia $17,468 -5.4 percent Texas $8,261 -4.7 percent South Dakota $8,446 -4.1 percent  In contrast, the census report shows that in the four years before Walker took office, Wisconsins per-student spending rose -- by 3.6 percent in 2010-11, 2.6 percent in 2009-10, 3.7 percent in 2008-09 and 4 percent in 2007-08. In terms of blaming Walker for the cuts, the governor, along with the Republican-controlled Legislature, had direct control over state money, which amounted to 48 percent of the spending by Wisconsin schools in 2011-12. Through the Act 10 collective bargaining reform law, Walker and the Legislature required employees to pay more toward their pension and enabled school districts to charge employees more for health insurance as a way to offset some of the state aid cuts. But as we noted in rating the biggest cuts in state history claim, the Greater Wisconsin Committees statement was not about net impact, just the state funding side of the equation. Walker and the Legislature also had significant influence over local funding, which amounted to 44 percent of the schools spending, because they essentially froze the amount of property tax revenue that local school districts could raise. Walker had no real control over federal funding, which amounted to 8 percent of total spending by Wisconsin schools. Other measures Now, using the same census report, lets look at the revenue figures, focusing on how much state money went to Wisconsin schools. Once again, Wisconsin was at the top in terms of cuts.  State Per-pupil REVENUE in 2011-12 from STATE GOVERNMENT Change from 2010-11  Wisconsin  $5,544 -8.33 percent Idaho $4,630 -6.79 percent Arizona $3,018 -6.46 percent Wyoming $9,466 -5.05 percent Florida $3,273 -4.84 percent  So, the state revenue measure also supports the Greater Wisconsin Committee claim. But there some newer figures available. A May 2014 report from the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a liberal think tank in Washington, D.C., examined state funding of schools in 2013-14. Those figures show Wisconsin was among 15 states that reduced state per-student spending from the previous year. Wisconsin's 0.6 percent reduction (adjusted for inflation) wasnt the largest cut, but rather the third-smallest. (Alaskas 3.2 percent cut was the largest.) Wisconsin state funding was $5,747 per student in 2013-14, versus $5,783 the previous year. As for comparing states on school funding for the entirety of Walkers term, those figures simply arent available yet. Our rating The Greater Wisconsin Committee said: Scott Walker cut school funding more per student than any governor in America. Based on the latest census figures, for 2011-12, the Wisconsin cuts were the largest based on two measures -- state revenue provided to local schools and overall spending by schools of state, federal and local money. But more recent figures indicate that Wisconsins school spending cuts are no longer the largest, at least for a more recent period.

Bob Barr of Georgia blasted his former party for running up the federal budget deficit during the last eight years. Barr added that he wasn't about to give likely Republican presidential nominee Sen. John McCain any reprieve merely because the Arizona senator is a longtime opponent of so-called pork barrel spending. Opposition to earmarks – line items in the federal budget directed to local and state projects – while a positive, isn't enough, says Barr. Eliminating earmarks would make barely a drop in the bucket with regard to the national debt, the deficit, he said after announcing his candidacy at the National Press Club in Washington. As it turns out, Barr's right on the money about how little earmarks have contributed to expanding the national debt. While earmarking has become an easy focal point for fiscal conservatives concerned about the budget deficit, which is now more than $9-trillion in total, having added another $163-billion plus interest in 2007, it's only a small part of the problem. According to an Office of Management and Budget tally, earmarks totaled $17-billion in fiscal 2007, only about 10 percent of the deficit that year. Admittedly, that's after earmarking dropped considerably following the congressional lobbying scandals of 2005 and 2006. But even at their peak in 2005, when earmarks hit $52-billion, according to the Congressional Research Service and the OMB, that was only 16 percent of that year's deficit of $318-billion. Whether Barr's statement is true or not, then, depends on how you define drop in the bucket. We'd say that Barr's pretty much correct, so we grade his statement Mostly True.

Final Rating: Mostly True  ","The Seminole gambling compact offers $3 billion in guaranteed revenue, the largest share for any state in history.","The Seminole Tribe of Florida is trying to convince the Legislature that approving a new gaming compact is a safe bet. As lawmakers consider a plan negotiated between the Seminoles and Gov. Rick Scott, the tribe has started running commercials with the message that the agreement helps the state. One of the ads ticks off several benefits of the deal Scott has touted to the Legislature, which has been reluctant to agree to the compact. The governor authorized a new and unprecedented Seminole compact: Nearly 20,000 new Florida jobs; $3 billion in guaranteed revenue, the largest share for any state in history; and for the first time, empowering the Legislature to limit expansion to keep Florida's entertainment options family friendly, the commercial said. Thats a lot to pack into one 30-second spot. PolitiFact Florida was especially curious about the $3 billion in payments the tribe promised the state. Is it really the most any state has received from Indian gaming in history? It looks like the odds are in the tribes favor. Reaching an agreement This is a very convoluted subject, but heres a quick-start look at the issue: Since 1988, the U.S. government has allowed federally recognized Indian tribes to run gambling establishments on tribal land. But if a tribe wants to have certain Las Vegas-style games at its casino known as Class III games (blackjack, roulette, slot machines and so forth), it must reach a legal agreement with its state, called a compact. The Seminole tribe reached a deal with then-Gov. Charlie Crist in 2010 that allowed them to operate banked card games — games in which players bet against the house instead of each other — at five of its seven casinos across the state. The Seminoles agreed to pay Florida for exclusive rights to operate these games, plus slot machines at four casinos outside Miami-Dade and Broward counties. These revenues usually amounted to well over $200 million per year for the state. The compact expired in July 2015, with a renewal deadline of Oct. 31, 2015. There hasnt been a new agreement, leading to lawsuits between Florida and the Seminoles over who can operate these games. The tribe continues to operate the Class III games of blackjack, chemin de fer and baccarat at those five casinos without a compact. In December 2015, Scott announced he had formed a new compact with the Seminoles. Among the details in the 20-year deal is a promise that the tribe could expand craps and roulette at their casinos and offer blackjack exclusively for seven years. The tribe would guarantee a minimum of $3 billion in payments to the state over those seven years. The Legislature is considering approving the compact during the 2016 session. On Feb. 9, the House Regulatory Affairs Committee okayed a bill to ratify the compact, but the Senate delayed its vote. Is that $3 billion in guaranteed revenue to Florida the most any state has ever gotten, as the Seminoles commercial says? Its the guaranteed part that tips the tribes hand. Comparing compacts Dozens of Indian tribes have gaming compacts in 26 states, and the details differ not only among states, but among tribes in a given state. While tribes can reach agreements to share revenue with local governments and pay regulatory costs, were just looking at how much states get. Comparing these compacts is a tall order. Given the nature of the industry, casinos are always opening and closing, contract terms are being updated or changed, and the terms of the payments tribes give differ depending on the compact. Thats especially true when considering states like Connecticut, whichreceives a lot of money but bases compact payments on a percentage of casino earnings, or Washington, which negotiated compacts so money goes to local governments instead of the state. The Seminoles currently pay the state quite a bit for a single tribe, which we can illustrate with overall earnings and revenue-sharing figures. In California, for example, tribal casinos make about $7 billion per year, highest in the nation. Of that, they give about $241 million to the state in 2014. (The state had compacts with 73 tribes in 2014, but only 11 of those tribes paid into the general revenue fund.) Tribes in Oklahoma, which generated $3.8 billion in gaming revenues from 124 casinos, paid the state about $125 million in 2013. Florida is in third place for total gaming revenues, with more than $2.3 billion from eight casinos. The Seminoles operate seven of those to make the lions share of the revenue, and as we mentioned, more than $200 million of those revenues go to the state annually. (The Miccosukee tribe, which operates an eighth casino in the Miami area, does not need a compact based on the games it offers.) Robert Jarvis, a law professor at Nova Southeastern University in Fort Lauderdale, said the Seminoles can afford to give the state so much because they enjoy several distinct advantages tribes in other states do not. The Seminoles live on land close to population centers, like the Hard Rock casinos in Tampa and Hollywood. They also dont have to fight with other tribes for customers. It doesnt hurt that this is Florida, where tourists flock and bring gambling money with them. These factors affect how the Seminoles have negotiated with the state. The new Seminole compact offers the guaranteed $3 billion in rising increments, from $325 million the first year up to $550 million in the seventh year. There are other provisions and potential payments in the compact, but that $3 billion is money the tribe has promised to pay no matter what. Even though apples-to-apples comparisons are difficult, by that final year the Seminoles would be paying more than the total any other single state gets from all its tribes. The Seminoles are willing to pay out a lot more than other tribes, Jarvis said, because they want exclusivity in a market that the Legislature could open up to other casino developers. The real question here is not the money, which in a budget as big as Floridas really amounts to a rounding error, he said. Its about expanding gambling in Florida. And if youre for that, the question becomes, who do you want to run the casinos, the Seminoles or someone else? Our ruling The Seminole Tribe of Florida said their new gambling compact offers $3 billion in guaranteed revenue, the largest share for any state in history. The tribe's point about guaranteed compensation over seven years holds up when focused on total dollars. But there's no easy way to make apples-to-apples comparisons of the details between various states and their gaming compacts. Some states have compacts with many other tribes.Some deals call for tribes to split a portion of revenues only with local governments. The takeaway from the ad is Florida is getting the best financial deal of any state in the country, but the finer points aren't clear.

Final Rating: Mostly True  ","Says President Donald Trump put out a $297 million contract to a vendor to show him how to hire Border Patrol. So, the first payment they made was $14.8 million. You know how many Border Patrol they hired with $14.8 million? Two.","The Trump administration paid a company millions of dollars to help the government hire Border Patrol agents, but only two agents were employed, claimed U.S. Rep. Henry Cuellar, D-Texas. (President Donald Trump) put out a $297 million contract to a vendor to show him how to hire Border Patrol. So, the first payment they made was $14.8 million. You know how many Border Patrol they hired with $14.8 million? Two,  Cuellar said during a Feb. 22 press conference in Laredo, Texas. Were only two Border Patrol agents hired under a $14.8 million initial payment of a $297 million contract? Cuellars broad claim of a troubled hiring process is accurate. But his statement overlooks some details, and the dollar figure he cited is slightly higher than the initial payment. The federal government has had problems finding and keeping people to work as Border Patrol agents, so it decided to turn to the private sector for help. U.S. Customs and Border Protection in November 2017 awarded a $297 million contract to Accenture Federal Services, so it could help the government recruit and hire 7,500 qualified candidates over five years. The jobs to fill are for Border Patrol agents, Customs and Border Protection officers, and Air and Marine Interdiction agents. The Office of Inspector General within the Department of Homeland Security audited the contract in response to hotline complaints about the contract. The inspector generals office in a December 2018 report said that Accenture had not delivered the promised hiring process or results and relied on government resources to fulfill its obligations. It detailed several other concerns. CBP risks wasting millions of taxpayer dollars on a hastily approved contract that is not meeting its proposed performance expectations, the report said. CBP must hold the contractor accountable, mitigate risk, and devise a strategy to ensure results without additional costs to the government. As of Oct. 1, 2018 — 10 months into the contract — Customs and Border Protection had paid Accenture about $13.6 million for startup costs, security requirements, recruiting, and applicant support. In return, Accenture has processed two accepted job offers, the report said. Cuellars office said his claim was based on this finding. The inspector generals office told PolitiFact that those two accepted job offers processed by Accenture were for a Border Patrol agent and for a Customs and Border Protection officer. (CBP officers work at ports of entry and dont necessarily go out on patrol duties.) Customs and Border Protection referred PolitiFact to a statement it issued after the reports publication. While we take some exception to the OIGs characterization of the contract, we do agree the contract has been a challenge, primarily due to the innovative efforts by both parties, and we are reviewing how best to use it moving forward, said part of the statement. The inspector generals report also included Customs and Border Protections response to the audit. The agency said it was inaccurate to say that the $13.6 million only yielded two accepted job offers, because Accenture also created a hiring structure, tailored technology solutions to support and manage the hiring process, stood up an applicant care center, marketed and recruited thousands of new applicants, and conducted many of the hiring steps for several thousand applicants. The inspector generals officer countered that response, saying, While we recognize that CBP has worked with Accenture to establish hiring activities, we stand by our statement that such activities have resulted in only two accepted job offers as of Oct. 1, 2018. One of the issues flagged by the report was a period when neither Accenture nor Customs and Border Protection could determine which applicants were recruited by Accenture, due to Office of Management and Budget restrictions and privacy concerns. Accenture also did not always provide human resource personnel and the people needed to conduct background investigations. And even though Accenture said it could provide an innovative applicant tracking system, it used the governments hiring system instead, the inspector general report said. Due to those shortcomings, the government modified the contract and gave the company a three-month interim period (March through June 2018) to fix those issues. During this period, Customs and Border Protection did a lot of the work Accenture was supposed to be doing. And because Accenture couldnt determine which applicants it recruited, the government agreed to give them credit and temporarily pay Accenture for a percentage of all applicants regardless of whether CBP or Accenture processed the applicants. As of Oct. 1, 2018, CBP had processed 14 applicants on behalf of Accenture. All 14 applicants accepted job offers, and seven of the 14 entered on duty, which translated to payment of approximately $500,000 to Accenture for work CBP had completed, the report said. So, even though there were these additional hires, its unclear if they were employed due to Accentures recruitment efforts. The inspector generals report said Accenture was nowhere near satisfying its 7,500-person hiring goal over the next 5 years. Customs and Border Protection told PolitiFact there were new hires from Accenture brought onboard and others who had accepted job offers since the Oct. 1, 2018 date referenced in the report. Its unclear how many were Border Patrol agents, how many were exclusively recruited and processed by Accenture, and whether they were covered in the initial payment to Accenture. Cuellar said, Trump put out a $297 million contract to a vendor to show him how to hire Border Patrol. So, the first payment they made was $14.8 million. You know how many Border Patrol they hired with $14.8 million? Two. The Trump administration awarded a $297 million contract to Accenture to help Customs and Border Protection hire 7,500 new employees over five years. That includes Border Patrol agents. An inspector general report said that as of Oct. 1, 2018, Customs and Border Protection paid Accenture about $13.6 million for startup costs, security requirements, recruiting, and applicant support. The company to that date had processed two accepted job offers, the report said. One of them was a Border Patrol agent, the other a Customs and Border Protection officer. The report mentioned 14 other accepted job offers processed by Customs and Border Protection on behalf of Accenture. But due to deficiencies in the contract, its unclear if those 14 were hired because of Accentures recruitment. Cuellars statement is accurate but needs clarification.",0.8,0.4,1.0,0.6,0.2,0.3,0.5,0.9,0.7,Mostly True

Final Rating: Mostly True  ",Rick Scott tried to slash school funding by $3.3 billion.,"Both Charlie Crist and Rick Scott will have gubernatorial records to fuel the campaign fire this year. The attacks have already started, with Crist firing a shot about Scotts budget actions over the years. On a page titled Top 5 reasons to make Florida Scott-free, Crist brings up education spending as No. 1. Rick Scott tried to slash school funding by $3.3 billion, the site says. To put that into perspective, $3.3 billion could pay the yearly salaries of more than 70,000 teachers in Florida. Considering Scott came into office during the Great Recession, his budget cutting is well known. We thought wed dive into the numbers to see whether he proposed that the states schools take a $3.3 billion hit. Slash and learn Scott entered office in 2011, facing a $3.6 billion shortfall in the states $70.5 billion budget. His solution in February 2011 was to propose cutting $4.6 billion in spending and $2.4 billion in state revenue by reducing taxes, regulations and fees. His budget came in at $65.9 billion. His proposal, encompassing two fiscal years, recommended cutting per-pupil spending by about $700, a 10 percent reduction from the states current $6,899 spending per student at the time. Part of the cuts included a 10 percent cut in the required local effort portion of property taxes and a loss of more than $870 million in federal stimulus money. In all, that added up to a projected $4.8 billion in cuts to education over the two years. The Scott plan attempted to offset some of those cuts with other federal aid and by requiring teachers to contribute 5 percent to their pension plans, adding back about $400 per student. Weve broken down some of those dollar figures before. In all, funding would have been cut some $3.3 billion the first year. Legislators did not respond well to such a drastic proposed budget reduction for schools. Are we looking at the cuts the governor is making? The answer is no, a resounding no, PreK-12 Education Appropriations subcommittee chairman Sen. David Simmons, R-Altamonte Springs, told the Gainesville Sun. After a contentious session, the Legislature passed and Scott signed a budget that included $1.3 billion in cuts to education, from $18.2 billion to $16.5 billion. The reduction ended up being about $540 per student, a 7.9 percent cut in funding. The following year, Scott requested a $1 billion increase in education dollars, which was included in the 2012-2013 state budget. The increase was needed to make up for more than 30,000 new students and a decline in property taxes from a 3 percent drop in property values. He then requested $1.2 billion more in 2013; the Legislature agreed to $1 billion. This year he has asked Tallahassee for $542 million more for next year, bringing the totals to $10.6 billion in state cash and $18.8 billion overall. This would be a record amount of spending in terms of dollars, but still less than the amount being spent per student when he took office. The ruling Crist said Rick Scott tried to slash school funding by $3.3 billion, pointing to a budget proposal from 2011, Scotts first year in office. Scott did propose cutting $3.3 billion from the education budget, alienating members of his own party in the Legislature in the process. He even had suggested cutting $4.8 billion over two years. Part of the cuts were from the loss of federal stimulus dollars, but the state had the power to restore them had it chosen to. In the end, Tallahassee approved $1.3 billion in cuts. Scott has asked for increases in the three years since. Crists statement was specifically phrased, saying Scott tried to reduce school funding. That is accurate, but its important to note that Scott's initial proposal died in the Legislature, and funding has increased since that attempt.",1.0,0.2,1.0,0.8,0.0,0.3,0.5,1.0,0.7,Mostly True

Final Rating: Mostly True  ","The most recent Associated Press poll has Nader-Gonzalez at 6 percent, without any national coverage, against McCain and Obama.","Perennial presidential candidate Ralph Nader is in an uphill battle for both media coverage and significant poll numbers. But somehow he's managing to get the latter without getting any of the former, he said in a recent radio interview. The most recent Associated Press poll has Nader-Gonzalez at 6 percent, without any national coverage, against McCain and Obama, Nader said during a June 18interviewonDemocracy Now!,an independent, left-leaning radio program. Nader garnered less than half that in the 2000 election and, by many accounts, damaged Al Gore enough to hand George W. Bush the White House. We checkedthe Associated Press pollsand found none that gave Nader 6 percent. The most recent AP poll prior to the interview was an AP-Yahoo poll from April 17 that had Nader at 3 percent. Nader spokesman Chris Driscoll acknowledged the candidate had erred, and said he meant to cite a June 6CNN/Opinion Research Corp. poll, which did indeed have Nader and his running mate Matt Gonzalez at 6 percent against Democratic Sen. Barack Obama, Republican Sen. John McCain and former GOP Rep. Bob Barr, the Libertarian candidate. The finding needs context, though. Was it just an outlier? And what does it say about how Nader will do in November? Other recent polls show Nader with less support.A Rasmussen Reports pollreleased May 18 showed Nader pulling in 4 percent against Obama, McCain and Barr.A Reuters/Zogby pollreleased June 18 showed Nader with 3 percent.A Fox News/Opinion Dynamics pollreleased June 19, the day after Nader's interview, gave him 4 percent. History suggests, however, that even these polls overstate Nader's prospects. At this time in 2000, he was showing around 4 or 5 percent in most national polls, and he ended up with 2.7 percent of the vote. Around this time in 2004, polls had Nader at anywhere from 3 to 7 percent. He got just .38 percent in the end. Now, onto Nader's assertion that his support has come without any national coverage. Clearly he was speaking rhetorically — we found his name mentioned 166 times on the major broadcast and cable news programs between the first of the year and the June 18 interview. But that's six months. Obama and McCain had been mentioned on television about that much in just the previous three days. Nader's coverage had been so slight compared to that of the major-party candidates that we have a hard time holding his hyperbole against him. We are also reluctant to pick on Nader too much for getting the name of a poll wrong. So with the caveat that his claim says little about how he'll do in November, we find it Mostly True.

Final Rating: Mostly True  ",The University of Wisconsin System budget is the biggest it has ever been.,"The 2015-16 academic year ended with pomp, circumstance -- and skirmishes between Gov. Scott Walker and professors in the University of Wisconsin System. Several days later, on May 16, 2016, Walker kept up the offensive in an interview on WTMJ-AM in Milwaukee. We have some of the best schools in the country, no doubt about it, Walker told conservative talk show host Charlie Sykes. But weve got to stop feeding into this national perception that how much you pay in tuition suddenly is a correlation to what the value is. Yeah, you want to have a reasonable level of support for the system; and we do. In fact, by the way, Walker continued, the University of Wisconsin System budget is the biggest it has ever been. The amount of money they get from state government is only a fraction of what they have overall. So, for all this hysteria out there, they have never had more money to spend in the UW System. With the 2015-17 state budget, Walker and his fellow Republicans in the Legislature cut $250 million over the two years from the UW System. That was an 11 percent reduction in state support and a big reason for the no-confidence votes. So, we wondered about Walkers claim that UW Systems budget is the biggest its ever been. Hes essentially correct, but with some caveats. Walker was referring to the systems all-funds budget -- which, as the name suggests, is comprehensive. It includes state tax dollars, but also an array of other funds, such as tuition, revenue from enterprises such as dormitories and athletics, federal research dollars and gifts.  We asked for budget figures from the nonpartisan Legislative Fiscal Bureau for the entire history of the UW System, which began in 1973-'74. Heres a look at the last six years, when the figures were highest. Year All-funds budget -- actual All-funds budget -- adjusted for inflation 2010-11 $5.591 billion $6.077 billion 2011-12 $5.589 billion $5.889 billion 2012-13 $5.901 billion $6.092 billion 2013-14 $5.997 billion $6.101 billion 2014-15 $6.098 billion $6.105 billion 2015-16 $6.194 billion* $6.059 billion As you might expect, the current all-funds budget (2015-16) is the largest on record. But with an asterisk. Thats because in 2015-16, for the first time, the UW System included unspent tuition money carried over from the previous year in its all-funds budget. If that money wasnt included, the 2015-16 all-funds budget would have been $6.059 billion -- the second-highest ever, behind 2014-15, rather than $6.194 billion. Adjusted for inflation -- a better measure for comparing figures over time -- the 2015-16 all funds budget is slightly smaller than in four of the five previous years, but still near the top. State support Walker made it clear his claim was about total funding for the UW System, and that state money covers only a portion of the systems budget. But its worth noting that, adjusted for inflation, state support of the system -- known as general purpose revenue -- is in a historic decline, according to figures from the fiscal bureau. The highest state support, adjusted for inflation, was in the first year of the system, 1973-74 -- at just under $1.52 billion. That figure hit an all-time low of $1.03 billion in 2015-16. UW System officials often cite the reduction in state support because they have generally have more flexibility in spending state tax dollars than with revenues that are designated for certain purposes. Our rating Walker said: The University of Wisconsin System budget is the biggest it has ever been. The systems 2015-16 all-funds budget -- which includes not only state tax dollars but federal funds, tuition and other income -- is $6.194 billion, the biggest since the system was created in 1973-74. But adjusted for inflation, the 2015-16 all-funds budget is among the biggest, though not the biggest. And the 2015-16 figure includes unspent tuition revenue that hadnt been counted in the all-funds budget in previous years. For a statement that is accurate but needs clarification, our rating is Mostly True.",0.8,0.5,1.0,0.7,0.0,0.5,0.4,1.0,0.6,Mostly True

Final Rating: Mostly True","Right now in Ohio 200,000 people are getting opioid treatment because they have insurance under the Affordable Care Act.","The Affordable Care Act is helping people in Ohio get the treatment they need for opioid addiction, said U.S. Sen. Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio. Right now in Ohio 200,000 people are getting opioid treatment because they have insurance under the Affordable Care Act, he said in an April 9 speech to the City Club of Cleveland. This is a common talking point by Brown, who will face the winner of the May 8 Republican primary that features U.S. Rep. Jim Renacci and businessman Mike Gibbons, among other candidates. Ohio is one of the states that expanded Medicaid as part of the 2010 federal health care law, and isone of the hardest hit states in the nation by the opioid epidemic.Experts have said that the program for the poor has helped treat those with opioid addiction. Brown was citing a valid study about the Affordable Care Act, but he didnt precisely explain what the researchers found. We learned itis difficult to pinpoint how many have gotten this type of treatment as a result of the law. Brown cited research by Harvard Medical School. The research, conducted by health economics professor Richard Frank and New York University Dean Sherry Glied, was released in January 2017 when Republicans were vowing to repeal the Affordable Care Act, though that didnt happen. Repealing the ACA — and its behavioral health provisions — would have stark effects on those with behavioral health illnesses, the researchers concluded. Nationwide, the researchers estimated that approximately 1.25 million people with serious mental disorders and about 2.8 million Americans with a substance use disorder, of whom about 222,000 have an opioid disorder, would lose some or all of their insurance coverage if the federal health care law was repealed. In Ohio, the researchers found that 220,512 people with addiction or mental health disorders had coverage under the Affordable Care Act in 2016. (Brown said right now, but this data is two years old.) About151,200 obtained coveragethrough the Medicaid expansion and 69,225 obtained plansthrough the marketplace. While Brown specifically said that 200,000 were getting opioid treatment, the research was more broad, because it addresses addiction and mental health disorders in general. Sometimes Brown has more precisely explained that 200,000 figure, including in a press statement when the study was released. But at other times, he has said that 200,000 Ohioans were getting opioid treatment through the Affordable Care Act. One of the researchers confirmed for PolitiFact that the 220,000 figure referred to significant behavioral health or substance use disorder needs.  The data we had analyzed do not indicate how many in this group used substance use treatment services, said Glied of NYU. Its clear that more broadly, Medicaid expansion has helped Ohioans seek drug treatment. Glied said that about half of all medication-assisted treatment for substance abuse treatment in Ohio is paid by Medicaid. Browns office spokeswoman, Jennifer Donahue, pointed to news reports showing that 500,000 low-income Ohio adults received mental health and addiction services under the states Medicaid expansion, including many for drug addiction. Donahue also cited news reports showing Republican Gov. John Kasich credited the Medicaid expansion for helping treat opioid addicts. Other health care experts, including the Kaiser Family Foundation, have expressed similar views that the Affordable Care Actwill play a key role in tackling the opioid epidemic. Spokespersons for state departments of health, addiction services and Medicaid told us they didnt have any data showing how many Ohioans had received opioid treatment as a result of the Affordable Care Act. However, between the time Ohio expanded Medicaid in 2014 through August 2017, more than 633,000 Ohioans with behavioral health needs had accessed services, including addiction treatment and mental health, throughexpanded Medicaid coverage. But we dont know how many in this group received opioid treatment. The state data suggests that those receiving services may be even higher than the Harvard study, which was based on 2016 data, if we include additional years. Brown said, Right now in Ohio 200,000 people are getting opioid treatment because they have insurance under the Affordable Care Act. Harvard and New York Universityresearchers concluded that about 220,000 people with addiction or mental health disorders had coverage through the Affordable Care Act, either through Medicaid expansion or purchasing insurance on the exchange, in 2016. But Brown oversimplified the study.The statistic is more broad than those who have received treatment for opioid addiction. Other state data suggest the number could be higher than 220,000, if we include multiple years. Browns general point that the Affordable Care Act has benefited people who need opioid treatment is supported by experts.",0.7,0.5,1.0,0.6,0.0,0.3,0.5,0.4,0.5,Mostly True

Final Rating: Mostly True  ","Says for the equivalent cost of a single mile of freeway, we have a bike infrastructure.","Portlands biking infrastructure is the stuff of legends. For the people who support it, were Biketown U.S.A. -- the city that boasts (at least among medium and large cities) the highest bike commuter rate. For those who are less into that title, our investments in cycling paths and signs are monetary drains on the city budget.Youd think, then, given the strong feelings, that Portland has made significant investments to get a significant infrastructure.But something Mayor Sam Adams said recently caught our attention. In a video on Streetfilms.org, Adams touts our biking culture while adding that we built our bike network for about the same amount of cash that a mile of highway would set us back.You know in 1993 we weren't the bicycling capital of America, he says. Seventeen years later, for the equivalent cost of a single mile of freeway, we have a bike infrastructure.Could that be true? We checked it out.Our first stop was the mayors office, which forwarded us an e-mail from Roger Geller, the citys bike coordinator. Geller said that in 2009, the staff set out to put together an estimated total cost for the citys bike infrastructure in 2008 dollars.When all was said and done, they came up with an estimated value of $52 million and adjusted it up to $60 million to be safe. Heres how they arrived at that figure:We assumed that all elements that contributed to the city's bikeway system were reasonable costs to include, even if they were not built for the express purpose of creating a bikeway. For example, we included the cost of pedestrian half-signals and bicycle-pedestrian bridges across I-5, among others. These signals and bridges facilitate crossings for existing bicycle boulevards, even though they were in place before the bicycle boulevards were constructed.For multi-use trails we split the construction cost of the trail in half and assigned half the cost to pedestrians. For the Eastbank Esplanade I believe we divided the cost into thirds and assigned one-third of the cost to park development, as much of the construction of that pathway was not about transportation but was also about creating a parklike environment.To be clear, he added, the network did not actually cost $60 million. It was probably less than that: The $60 million figure is essentially the replacement value of our network as it existed in 2008 in 2008 dollars. In other words, if the bikeway network disappeared overnight -- and all the elements that contribute to its functionality, whether built by the city's bikeway program or not -- $60 million is approximately what it would cost to replace it all.We called Geller directly to go over the specifics with him, just to make sure we were on the same page. We wanted to be sure that this official estimate included bike-only corridors and other such construction projects.He confirmed it did, adding: I'm very confident in the quality of our estimates.The one thing Geller said it didnt include was city programs that deal with bicycles -- Oregon Safe Routes to School, for example. Even so, the cost of those activities, stretching back to 2004, could be absorbed in the rounding up from $52 million to $60 million, Geller said.Next up, we needed an estimated cost for a mile of freeway. This is where things get a bit tricky.The cost of a mile of freeway isnt easy to pin down. The mayors office said Adams was referring to a mile of a typical 4-lane urban freeway. That cost, according to the citys data, ranges between $20 to $80 million depending on various environmental factors.They chose $60 million -- the middle road -- to indicate the average cost. Of course, Geller wrote in the original e-mail, it is possible to find examples right here in our region of a single interchange that cost much more than $60 million.Their source for that figure was the Rails to Trails Conservancy. That group published the figure in a 2008 report on transportation. We asked the Conservancy for their original source and they sent us a document that offers a considerably wider price range.According to that document the cost of freeways (in 2006 dollars) breaks down as such:-Rural areas: $3.1 million to $9.1 million per lane mile; $12.4 million to $36.4 million for a four-lane mile.-Urban areas: $4.9 miilion to $19.5 million per lane mile; $19.6 million to $78 million for a four lane mile.-Areas with severe restrictions: $16.8 million to $74.7 million per lane mile; $67.2 million to nearly $300 million for a four-lane mile.We tried to get some official estimates from the U.S. Department of Transportation, but they did not respond to our inquiry. Still, the numbers that the Conservancy reported seem to match other estimates, such as this one from the Michigan Department of Transportation.So, where does that put us with our ruling?It seems to us that Gellers estimate of the total value of the bike infrastructure is somewhat inflated. When Adams used this statistic he didnt make clear that he was talking about an urban four-lane freeway. But, certainly, $60 million in bike infrastructure is well above the $12.4 million it would take to make a mile of four-lane rural freeway.That said, Adams is the mayor of an urban area and it makes sense that he would be thinking in terms of the cost of urban freeway construction. When youre talking about that sort of freeway construction, $60 million falls pretty near the middle of the $20 million to $80 million estimated average cost.The mayor could have been a little more exact, but his statistic -- that Portland has spent on its bikeway infrastructure what it would spend on a mile of freeway -- seems to stand up to scrutiny.

Final Rating: Mostly True  ",I have had the challenge during this administration to suspend no less than 37 public officials in about 36 months.,"Some of Florida's public officials have been bad boys and girls, Gov. Charlie Crist says. You know, I have had the challenge during this administration to suspend no less than 37 public officials in about 36 months, Crist told reporters gathered in Tallahassee on Jan. 27, 2010. It's pretty stunning, and it's pretty disappointing. The Florida Constitution enables Crist, as governor, to suspend any elected public official indicted for a crime and remove public officials from office who are convicted. The governor also can suspend state or county officials -- anyone from people appointed to state or local boards or even public notaries -- for misconduct. Is Crist really on a suspension-a-month pace? We asked the governor's office for a list of people suspended by the governor since he took office in January 2007. Officials provided a seven-page document listing 38 names and titles of people they say the governor has suspended or removed from public office. Each entry includes a corresponding charge and points to an executive order codifying the action. (You can read the governor's document for yourself.) The list includes some familiar names: *No. 28 -- James Bob Richburg, the former Northwest Florida State College president. Richburg was suspended from the board of directors of Workforce Florida in April 2009 after being indicted in the case involving former House Speaker Ray Sansom. Sansom has been accused of falsely securing $6 million in taxpayer money to construct a college building that would double as an aircraft hangar for a friend and major Republican donor. * No. 35 -- Scott Rothstein. Rothstein was suspended from a judicial nominating committee after agreeing to be permanently disbarred. A major political fundraiser, Rothsteinpleaded guilty on Jan. 27, 2010, to five counts of racketeering, fraud and money laundering as part of a $1.2 billion Ponzi scheme. * No. 34 and No. 38 -- Miami City Commissioner Michelle Spence-Jones. Spence-Jones was suspended by Crist in November 2009 after being arrested on charges that she redirected $50,000 in county funds to a now-defunct family business. She won her seat back in a special election in January 2010. She was immediately suspended again. The list also includes people probably unfamiliar to most, including eight notary publics. The notary publics, who are considered state officers under Florida law, were suspended in most cases for notarizing signatures and documents improperly. Examining the full list, we found some problems: * Beverly Gallagher,a member of the Broward County School Board, is listed wrongly both as No. 30 and 32. Her entries point to two different executive orders -- one that removes her from office, and one that removes someone else. Gallagher and Broward County Commissioner Josephus Eggelletion (No. 31 on the governor's list) were arrested in September on federal corruption charges, accused of taking bribes. * Gregory Burke is both No. 7 and No. 25. Burke, a commissioner of the South Walton County Mosquito Control District, was first suspended from office Dec. 13, 2007, then removed by Crist on Dec. 24, 2008 -- hence the two separate entries. * Two officials -- Miami City Commissioner Johnny Lee Winton and Hollywood City Commissioner Kenneth Wasserstrom -- were removed from office by Crist but actually suspended by Gov. Jeb Bush. * Another official, Miramar City Commissioner Fitzroy Salesman, appears on the list twice. The first entry was from March 2007, when he was reinstated into office by Crist (he had been suspended by Bush). Salesman was then suspended by Crist in December 2007 after being arrested. * No. 20, Johnny Green, was suspended from the Cross City water board after being charged with one count of conspiracy to commit bribery, according to the governor's office. Green's entry appears to note that the suspension was dissolved by Executive Order 08-235, but that order actually acknowledges a judicial vacancy in the 17th Judicial Circuit. The governor's list also includes one person who has returned to office and appears to overlook another person the governor suspended in 2008. John Scanlon, a commissioner with the Fort Myers Beach Fire Control District, was suspended after drug charges, but reinstated after completion of a pretrial diversion program. And James Roy Paul, superintendent of the Escambia County School District, was suspended from office by the governor in June 2008 after being charged with driving under the influence. But he was not on the governor's list. Where does all of that bring us in the accounting? First, we excluded the double reference to Gallagher and the entry reinstating Salesman. That drops us to 36. We then added Paul, who was not on the governor's list. Back to 37. We then double-checked that everyone on that list had been in fact suspended. We relied on the governor's online repository of executive orders, and when that didn't help, news accounts. When both options failed, as it did in one case, we asked the governor's office for the executive order directly. Then there was the case of three officials (Winton, Wasserstrom, Burke) whom Crist removed from office. You can make an argument that reduces the number of suspensions to 34. Crist told reporters he has had to suspend no less than 37 public officials since taking office in 2007. He's just about right on. The number actually includes people Cristremoved from office, a more severe punishment than suspension. And the final number includes the suspensions of eight public notaries -- not what most people think of when they hear public official.

Marco Rubio used his first speech on the Senate floor, on June 14, 2011, to evoke the American dream. The so-called maiden speech is a big deal for a senator, said fellow Florida Sen. Bill Nelson — and Rubio went for big ideas.America is not perfect, said the freshman Republican, the child of Cuban immigrants. ... But since her earliest days, America has inspired people from all over the world. Inspired them with the hope that one day their own countries would be one like this one. Many others decided they could not wait. And so they came here from everywhere, to pursue their dreams and to work to leave their children better off than themselves. And the result was the American miracle.As he held the floor for nearly 15 minutes, Rubio highlighted rags-to-riches stories that he said happen only in America, describing the founders of Nordstrom, Mattel and eBay. When he finished, Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., commended him, saying, No one expresses American exceptionalism better than Sen. Rubio.Rubio traced Americas role in the 20th century, from two world wars to the Cold War and the defeat of communism. Then he turned to other contributions:While our military and foreign policy contributions helped save the world, it was our economic and cultural innovations that helped transform it. The fruits of the American miracle can be found in the daily lives of people everywhere. Anywhere in the world, when someone uses a mobile phone, e-mail, the Internet or GPS, they are enjoying the benefits of the American miracle. Anywhere in the world, when a bone marrow, lung or heart transplant saves a life, they are touched by the value of the American miracle. And on one night in July of 1969, the whole world witnessed the American miracle firsthand. For on that night an American walked on the surface of the moon, and it was clear to the whole world that these Americans could do anything.We briefly considered wading into fringe conspiracy theories about whether astronauts actually walked on the moon, but got control of ourselves. We were more curious about his other technology claims. Were Americans truly the ones responsible for innovation of the mobile phone, e-mail, the Internet and the global positioning system?We dropped a line to Rubio spokesman Alex Burgos, who provided us with links about inventors of the mobile phone, e-mail, the Internet and GPS. Indeed, stories from The Telegraph (via Huffington Post), NPR, the Internet Society, PBS and MITnews identify American origins for all four technologies. But these are complex systems that have developed over time. We wondered: Was there more to the story?Mobile phoneA lot fits under the umbrella mobile phone -- including, say, early radio technology that led to car phones by the 1940s. But Rubios spokesman pointed to the inventor of the first portable cellular phone, which is fine by us. (Did you think of dawn-of-the-1900s ship-to-shore communication when Rubio said mobile phone? We didnt think so.)Martin Cooper worked for Illinois company Motorola as it developed the DynaTAC phone and the cellular network behind it in the early 1970s. The lead engineer for the team that developed the phone, Martin made the first wireless call from Manhattan in 1973. The FCC approved the phone -- the worlds first commercial portable cell phone -- for regular folks in 1983.Now, Japan and some European countries were quicker to deploy cellular networks, in the late 70s and very early 80s. But Paul Levinson, a Fordham University professor who wrote the 2004 book Cellphone: The Story of the World's Most Mobile Medium and How It Has Transformed Everything! says its the phone that matters.That was the breakthrough, he said There were several different companies and scientists working on it.  But no one believed that it could be done.  So everything that came afterwards was based on that first breakthrough.An American breakthrough. Score one for Rubio.Internet & E-mailWe read the work from the Internet Society and PBS that Burgos sent our way, then exchanged messages with Stephen Stein, who teaches the history of technology at the University of Memphis.Computer networks that led to the Internet we know today include Arpanet , a 1970s project of the U.S. Department of Defense, and NSFnet, created by the National Science Foundation in the 1980s. These projects, with their indisputably American roots, provided two cornerstones of the modern-day Web: the TCP/IP protocol and a major communications backbone.But Stein pointed out that the way we interact with the Internet owes much to the work of Tim Berners-Lee, a British scientist who worked for CERN, the European Particle Physics Laboratory in Switzerland. It was there -- in the late 80s as NSFnet was being developed in the United States -- that Berners-Lee developed the whole concept of the World Wide Web, Stein said. (Theres more on this in a PBS article related to the one Burgos sent.)HTTP? HTML? Both Berners-Lee.So, yes, Americans developed the Internet, but Berners-Lee made it user-friendly, Stein said.Meanwhile, Virginia Tech scholar Janet Abbate says in her 1999 book Inventing the Internet, published by MIT Press, that even in the expansion of Arpanet , Americans enlisted the help of computer experts from England and France. She also points to Berners-Lees contributions, saying, The history of the Internet is not  a story of a few heroic inventors; it is a tale of collaboration and conflict among a remarkable variety of players.The origins of e-mail, as you might expect, are entwined with the Internet. Electronic mail was part of the development of Arpanet in the early 70s, according to Stein, Abbate and others. American programmer Ray Tomlinson gets credit (and tongue-in-cheek blame) for the first working network mail program, picked up by users of Arpanet sites. Here's what Abbate told us when we asked her about Rubio's claim. I think it's an overstatement to call the Internet a purely American product. Certainly other countries were building their own computer networks (and inter-networks) in parallel with the U.S.; these other networks eventually became part of the Internet, Abbate said. Also, the Internet itself (as opposed to the earlier Apranet) was a collaborative effort with input from computer scientists in France and elsewhere, and I argue in my book that the diversity of input made the resulting system stronger. I do think the U.S. did a remarkably good job with the Internet design and expansion, maybe better than anyone else would or could have done. But if the resulting Internet hadn't suited other countries' needs, they were perfectly capable of creating their own networks (indeed, for a while there were a number of different competing network systems before TCP/IP eventually became the standard). And of course, the World Wide Web was invented at CERN, not in the US or by an American. So does that mean we in the U.S. are enjoying the benefits of the Swiss miracle every time we use the Web? GPSThe satellite technology that puts some of the smart in your smart phone and informs your cars navigation system is a system of satellites funded by taxpayers and operated by the U.S. government. So calling the global positioning system an American miracle is no stretch. The technology was born at Aerospace Corp., a military research contractor in El Segundo, Calif. Its founding president was New York native Ivan Getting. That isnt to say there arent foreign navigation satellites. The United States cooperates with Australia, China, the European Union, India, Japan and Russia on global navigation satellite systems, sometimes referred to as GNSS. But Rubio said GPS, and the history there is fairly clear -cut.The rulingWhat to make of all of this?Rubio's basic point, that the technology behind mobile phones, e-mail, the Internet and GPS all have American roots, holds up. Its true in a general sense, said Sherry Turkle, a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who writes on our relationship with technology. Or, as the University of Memphis professor, Stein, put it: The statement is superficially correct, but there is (as usual) more to the story. Stein was most concerned about the non-American role in the development of the Internet, especially the substantial contribution of England's Berners-Lee.Its also important to note in the context of Rubios only in America rhetoric that while the United States led, it wasnt alone in its innovation. Other nations researchers contributed to the early Internet; commercial mobile phone networks were available overseas before they were in America; other nations operate satellite navigation systems. But in these areas and many others, Americans can claim primacy.",0.7,0.5,1.0,0.6,0.4,0.6,0.8,1.0,0.5,Mostly True

Final Rating: Mostly True",The school voucher bill the Iowa Legislature is considering would give your education tax dollars to corporations.,"Iowa Republicans have forged ahead with efforts to dramatically change education policy in the state, while Democrats and some education leaders and teachers argue a school choice proposal from Gov. Kim Reynolds would divert money from public school systems that need it now more than ever. The push comes after Reynolds highlighted school choice in January during herCondition of the State Address. She argued that parents need flexibility when deciding where their children go to school, especially during a pandemic, but also because available services might vary dramatically from one public school district to another. School choice shouldnt be limited to those who have the financial means or are lucky to live in a district thats confident enough to allow open enrollment, Reynolds said during her Jan. 12 address. Republicans quickly announced their support and theIowa SenatepassedSF 159on Thursday, Jan. 28. The Iowa State Education Association, a prominent Iowa teachers union, launched acampaignagainst the bill and theIowa-Nebraska NAACPargued that it disproportionately would disadvantage low-income families of color while hampering desegregation efforts. Another opponent wasChristina Blackcloud, a Democratic activist from Tama, Iowa, who lost a bid last fall to unseat state Rep. Dean Fisher (R-Montour). Blackcloudtweetedon Jan. 23: Can I be blunt? The school voucher bill that Republicans are trying to ram through the Iowa Legislature would give your education tax dollars to corporations in the hopes they will magically fix education The tweet had been retweeted 190 times and liked by more than 700 people as February started, but would tax dollars usually sent to public schools be sent to corporations? To answer that, we followed the money. The Iowa bill would give financial aid for private school tuition and other education costs to a student who otherwise would attend a public school determined by the federalEvery Student Succeeds Actas needing comprehensive support and improvement. The private school also would have to accept the student for enrollment. The financial aid would come from a Student First Scholarship Program that the bill would establish. That program would be funded by depositing into an account created for a student opting to attend a private school a portion of the per-pupil state funding that youths school district would have received to educate the student. Areportfrom the states Legislative Services Agency estimates that Iowas public school districts would lose $2.1 million that is diverted to private schools in 2023 if the governors plan passes. The state money is raised through a combination of sources, including property taxes. The bill limits spending that money to qualified educational expenses, which include tuition but also fees for tests such as advanced placement exams. Students opting out of their local public school could use state money to attend either private schools or charter schools. But those schools may or may not be considered corporations. Technically,corporationsare a group of individuals legally allowed to act as a single entity, and both public school districts and public charter schools are referred to as corporations inIowa law. But thats not the common understanding of what a corporation represents. In an email exchange with PolitiFact, Blackcloud expressed concern that for-profit education service providers would be allowed to manage charter schools under Reynolds plan. She declined to clarify what she meant when describing private and charter schools as corporations. Charter schoolsare privately run, publicly funded schools. Many are managed by outside organizations, which the Iowa bill calls education service providers, that can be both for-profit and not-for-profit. SF 159 mandates that charter schools form as not-for-profit education organizations but says nothing about whether the education service providers the schools contract with must be for-profit or not-for-profit. TheNational Alliance for Public Charter Schoolsreported in 2019 that 12 percent of U.S. charter schools are managed by for-profit companies and 23 percent are managed by not-for-profit companies. The other 65 percent are independently managed. In general, though, theres no indication of how many charter schools in Iowa would be run by for-profit companies if Reynolds plan passes, especially as the plan would make forming charter schools much easier. That holds true for private schools as well. Blackcloud said, The school voucher bill that Republicans are trying to ram through the Iowa Legislature would give your education tax dollars to corporations in the hopes they will magically fix education. In its current form, SF 159 reallocates money that normally would be spent in public school systems, instead supporting students attending nonpublic schools. That money would be handed over to schools that, under Iowa law, are considered corporations. But, other not-for-profit options will exist, too, for nonpublic schooling.",0.7,0.6,0.9,0.6,0.4,0.5,0.4,0.9,0.5,Mostly True

Final Rating: Mostly True  ",I cut spending while serving in the state Legislature,"The cornerstone for any Republican seeking to be the next U.S. Representative for New Hampshires Second Congressional District is to come across as an authentic, fiscal conservative. And soon after Salem Republican state Rep. Marilinda Garcia announced that she would enter the Second District race, she touted her cost-cutting chops. I cut spending while serving in the state Legislature and will take that much-needed experience to Washington, Garcia, 30, declared in one of her first post-announcement statements on her Twitter account. The Telegraph and PolitiFact New Hampshire sought to determine the accuracy of that statement. State budget votes Garcia was first elected to the New Hampshire House in 2006 and was a backbencher when Democrats took control of the 400-member body for the first time in nearly a century. Garcia lost her reelection bid in 2008, but quickly won her seat back in a 2009 special election. Initially, Garcia served on the House Children and Family Law Committee, the panel that oversees divorce, adoption and custody but has essentially no direct impact on state spending matters. Claiming to cut spending is a pretty broad statement, but well start with the major vote New Hampshire legislators take to increase or cut spending -- consideration of the states biennial budget. When Garcia was sworn in on Jan. 3, 2007, the state budget set by her fellow Republicans was $9.3 billion. The subsequent $9.7 billion budget, called for a 4 percent increase for fiscal years 2008 and 2009 was written primarily by Democrats. Garcia voted against it. The next $11.5 billion budget, also written by Democrats, called for a hefty 19 percent increase in spending for fiscal years 2010 and 2011. Garcia also voted against that. And the next state budget, crafted by conservative Republicans, including Garcia,after the GOP took over the chamber, cut back spending by more than a billion dollars to $10.3 billion. That budget plan was the first reduction in absolute dollars since World War II. Garcia voted in favor of that budget. Finally, the most recent $11 billion budget, covering fiscal years 2013 and 2014 and written by a Democratic majority, restored some of the cuts made in the previous budget. Garcia again voted no, though she said he didnt mind restoringcuts to higher education, public safety and programs for troubled children. I thought with existing recovery of revenues we could add back some of those items, Garcia said in response to our inquiry about her record of cutting spending. Instead, she said she voted against it because of the removal of the Certificate of Need program that approves all construction projects for hospitals. I wanted to see those health care reforms in place, but they got taken out, so that's why I voted against it, Garcia said. Still, her budget votes while in the House are fairly consistent: Shes voted against every budget that called for an increase in spending and supported the one that cut spending. Other spending Reviewing Garcias entire, seven-year voting record and the bills she sponsored, Garcia consistently supportedpolicies that would cut spending and taxes. In 2011, she voted to cut the taxes on hotel room rentals and meals and tobacco. She endorsed making it easier for local governments to adopt spending caps and supported banning higher-education spending on New Hampshire Public Television. Last year she opposed raising state taxes on gasoline and tobacco. In addition, in 2011, Garcia voted for a bill to require agencies propose every two years how they would live with 10 percent cut in state spending. And in 2012, Garcia voted in favor of business tax breaks totaling more than $10 million a year. She did vote in favor of one bill that could have increased spending at the local level. She voted for House Bill 1305 in 2012 that would have reinstated an exemption from property taxes for telephone and communication company poles and conduits. Critics said this could have led to raising local property taxes $5 million to $6 million statewide to make up the difference. The GOP-led House killed the bill 166-133, with Garcia on the losing end. Does she deserve credit for cutting spending? When politicians claim credit for something that happens on their watch, we consider whether that credit is justified before we give the statement a Truth-O-Meter rating. In Garcias case, she is a legislator, not an executive, so she cant unilaterally cut spending. And much of the time, she has been in the minority. However, during the one session in which she served in the majority, she can make a plausible claim for deserving credit for lower spending. In April 2011, then-House Speaker William O'Brien, a Republican, appointed Garcia to the House Finance Committee. She served on the committee when the state faced an $800 million budgetary hole caused by overly optimistic revenue projections. We solved it not by raising taxes but by cutting in a responsible way, Garcia said. At least one fellow Republican agrees. Former House Chief of Staff Gregory Moore said that when it comes to budgets, there are three kinds of legislators: Those who believe in smaller government, those who believe in more government and those who are pragmatic on the question from issue to issue. From the outset, Marilinda Garcia came from the first camp. Our ruling Garcia said, I cut spending while serving in the state Legislature. Her voting record on the state budget -- which comprises any legislators biggest impact on state spending -- show that Garcia voted against every budget that increased spending and voted in favor of the OBrien budget that cut state spending for the first time since World War II. We found two minor asterisks. Even though she voted against the most recent state budget, she didnt oppose it because it increased spending -- she opposed it because of how it treated a program that governs hospital construction and expansion. And she supported a bill on telephone and communication company poles and conduits that would have had the effect of raising taxes.Still, there are few, if any, votes shes taken that would have increased spending or increased the size of government.",0.8,0.3,0.9,0.5,0.2,0.4,0.3,0.9,0.6,Mostly True

Final Rating: Mostly True",A gay man who survived #orlando hate crime can STILL show up to work in FL tomorrow and have his boss fire him simply because he is gay.,"As the motive behind the deadly June 12 shooting at a gay nightclub in Orlando was still being debated, singer Clay Aiken took to Twitter to characterize it as a hate crime and report that gays can be summarily fired in Florida simply because of their sexual orientation. A gay man who survived #orlando hate crime can STILL show up to work in FL tomorrow and have his boss fire him simply because he is gay, Aiken tweeted. For this fact check, we will look at whether Florida really offers no job protection to gays and lesbians. The short answer: Aiken is mostly correct when it comes to Florida as a whole, but he's wrong to suggest that there is no protection anywhere in the state. Federal law does not protect the employment rights of the LGBT community, nor does the state of Florida. However, thanks to city and county law, members of the LGBT community do have employment protection in some areas of Florida. Currently, 10 counties and 19 cities, including Tampa, St. Petersburg, Miami, Miami Beach, St. Augustine, Sarasota and Orlando, have passed protections for gay workers, according to Frank Penela, communications director for the Florida Commission on Human Relations. Penela also reported that although state law doesn't specifically reference LGBT status in employment, the Commission will accept some cases under sex-based discrimination. Allegations of gender identity/transgender discrimination, for example, can be viewed as sex discrimination. Aiken spokesman Josh Pultz noted that bills designed to add protection for gender identity and sexual orientation died in Florida's House and Senate in 2016. Regardless of existing employment anti discrimination ordinances protecting LGBT in at least 31 municipalities, covering as many as 15 counties in the state, the state does not provide such protections — leaving LGBT workers in as many as 52 of the 67 counties without any protection from being terminated because of their orientation, Pultz said in an email. Clay's comment stated nothing more than that a gay man in Florida can still be fired for being gay. It did not specify any certain municipality and therefore is factually accurate, he wrote. According to the American Civil Liberties Union's website, 22 states and the District of Columbia prohibit employment discrimination based on sexual orientation. The District and 19 states also ban discrimination based on gender identity. That makes Floridaone of 28 states with no statewide protection against discrimination. Our ruling Aiken tweeted, A gay man who survived #orlando hate crime can STILL show up to work in FL tomorrow and have his boss fire him simply because he is gay. That is generally true across the state, because gays and lesbians lack protection from employment discrimination under state law and under federal law.However, 19 Floridacities often offer protection to gay workers, including the city of Orlando. Another 10 counties also offer protections. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/7e41f675-9288-4071-bbb7-5510906aa369",0.8,0.4,1.0,0.6,0.3,0.1,0.5,1.0,0.7,Mostly True

Final Rating: Mostly True  ","Since the Sandy Hook tragedy, more than seven children PER DAY have died from gun violence.","U.S. Rep. Jackie Speier, D-San Mateo, is one of Californias most prominent advocates for gun control -- and one of the few members of Congress to personally experience and survive gun violence. Speierwas shot five times at point blank range in 1978 on a trip accompanying Rep. Leo Ryan to Jonestown, the remote commune in Guyana where 909 people died from cyanide poisoning and other means. Speier was a legal adviser to Ryan, who along with four others were shot and killed in an ambush near the compound. Speier was rescued a day later. Since then, shes spent much of her career in politics leading the call for gun safety. It was no surprise Speierspoke out against gun violence on Dec. 14, 2016, the fourth anniversary of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting. The shooter killed 20 students, ages six and seven, along with six adult staff members in whats considered the deadliest mass shooting at a school in U.S. history. On the anniversary, Speierposted an image on Twitter of herself holding a card reading #EndGunViolence. Above the image she claimed: Since the Sandy Hook tragedy, more than seven children PER DAY have died from gun violence. We wanted to know whether the startling and somber statistic was true. We set out on a fact check. Our research A spokeswoman for Speier cited the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence as the source of the statistic. She said the campaign used information from an online database of fatal injury reports maintained by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. We did not hear back from a spokesman for the Brady Campaign. But we found a similar statistic on the organizations website: Every day, 7 children and teens die from gun violence. The website notes that it crunched CDC data for children and young people through age 19. The federal agency is considered a leading authority on mortality and injury statistics. It includes data through 2015. To examine Speiers claim, we searched the database for the number of young people who died in connection with guns from the start of 2013 through 2015. Those are the most recent available years following the Sandy Hook shooting. We found 7,838 deaths in connection with firearms for people ages 0 through 19. That works out to 7.15 deaths a day during this three-year period -- which matches Speiers claim of more than seven per day. These include all types of gun deaths from accidents to homicides to suicides. About 36 percent resulted from suicides. Some might take issue with Speier lumping in 18 year-olds and 19 year-olds as children. Gun deaths for these two ages accounted for nearly half of the 7,838 young people killed in the two-year period. Heres a look at the breakdown of deaths by age group: 0-4 years: 247 5-9 years: 218 10-14 years: 847 15-19 years: 6,526 The National Institute of Justice, a research arm of the U.S. Department of Justice, has stated that young people aged 15 to 24 are the group most at risk for gun violence. If considering only elementary school aged children, the total who die in connection with guns would be roughly one every four days -- still a tragic number, but not close to seven per day. We interpreted Speiers use of the word children, however, to include a broader group of young people, including teenagers. Our ruling California Congresswoman Jackie Speier recently claimed: Since the Sandy Hook tragedy, more than seven children PER DAY have died from gun violence. Speiers claim is backed up by the CDCs fatal injury report data, which shows an average of 7.15 young people per day, aged 0 to 19, died in connection with firearms between 2013 and 2015. Its important to note these include all types of gun deaths: accidents, homicides and suicides. All gun deaths are violent, but Speiers statement could be interpreted as only including homicides or accidents. Finally, Speiers claim might also lead some to think shes talking about young school aged children, given that she invokes an elementary school shooting. The data show teenagers and young adults make up the vast majority of deaths due to guns in America, while elementary aged children account for a small fraction. The Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, the source Speier relied on, offers a more complete look at this statistic on its website. It notes that children and teens are included in the seven deaths per day. Speiers statement is on the right track. But it could have used some clarifications. MOSTLY TRUE– The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/423277eb-4cab-4fc1-8ab5-357f808c343d",1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,1.0,0.5,Mostly True

Final Rating: Mostly True",Says Betsy DeVos is the most unpopular person in our government.,"A congressional hearing about the Trump administrations policy on student debt turned personal for Education Secretary Betsy DeVos. Most of the Dec. 12 hearing focused on DeVos actions related to a student debt relief rule. Democrats said DeVos made it harder for certain students to get debt relief, while Republicans defended her response to Obama-era rules. At the hearing, the main topic was how DeVos sought to make changes to the borrower defense to repayment rule. The provision was little used until the Obama administration established new rules to help students get their federal education loans cancelled if colleges misrepresented graduation rates, their ability to transfer credits or their job placement rates. The Obama administration finalized changes to the regulations in 2016 after Corinthian Colleges, a for-profit chain, closed its doors amid fraud allegations. DeVos sought to rewrite the rules, leading to extensive litigation, including a contempt of court finding against DeVos. DeVos blamed the Obama administration for the backlog of tens of thousands of cases and announced changes that include tiers of loan relief. U.S. Rep. Frederica Wilson, a former school board member and principal from South Florida, went after DeVos, saying she is trying to destroy public education. You are the most unpopular person in our government, said Wilson, a Democrat. Millions will register to vote in 2020. Many will vote to remove you more than to remove the president. The ranking Republican on the committee, Rep. Virginia Foxx of North Carolina, said Wilsons comments were over the line. DeVoss confirmation in 2017 was a contentious one for the Trump administration and required a tie-breaking vote by Vice President Mike Pence. DeVos, a longtime wealthy Republican donor from Michigan, is an advocate for vouchers and charter schools. As fact-checkers, we wanted to focus on the checkable aspect of what Wilson said: Is DeVos really the most unpopular person in the U.S. government? Wilsons statement about in our government was overly broad, but what she was referring to was what poll respondents said about DeVos compared to other Trump Cabinet officials. We found polling that supports Wilsons statement about DeVoss popularity, but the polling is more than one year old. We found that YouGov and Morning Consult have conducted separate polls that compare the favorability of Trumps Cabinet members. Wilsons spokeswoman cited a 2017 article in the Huffington Post entitled, How Betsy DeVos Became The Most Hated Cabinet Secretary. The article cited an October 2017 HuffPost/YouGov internet poll that found 35% had a strongly unfavorable view of DeVos, the highest among 13 officials. (Former Attorney General Jeff Sessions finished second.) However, the poll also showed that many respondents were not familiar enough with the Cabinet members to give a favorability opinion. DeVos was among the most familiar officials, as 30% of respondents said they were unfamiliar with her. YouGov has polled about DeVos favorability five times since she was appointed. The most recent poll, in April 2018, found DeVos had the highest very unfavorable rating (28%). Politico/Morning Consult polled about the favorability of DeVos on four occasions since 2017, with the most recent one in the spring of 2018. That poll showed DeVos with a 31% very unfavorable rating, the highest among 15 Cabinet members. Even though the polls are a little dated, Wilsons statement is consistent with the evidence, said Washington University political scientist Steven S. Smith. Education Department spokeswoman Angela Morabito told PolitiFact that DeVos isnt working to win a popularity contest. But she pointed to polling by an education research and policy journal showing growing public support for certain school choice programs. Related: By the numbers: Is college worth the cost? Wilson said DeVos is the most unpopular person in our government. Two polling organizations asking about popularity for about a dozen Trump administration officials back up her statement, though they are a little outdated. We found no polling about the popularity for DeVos in 2019.",0.7,0.3,0.9,0.5,0.2,0.4,0.6,0.5,0.4,Mostly True

Final Rating: Mostly True  ","Of 30,000 individuals arrested a year for crimes that are 16 or 17, over 95 percent of them do not result in a criminal conviction. Only 1.5 percent of them ultimately go to state prison.","New York remains one of two states that can prosecute 16- and 17-year-old defendants as adults in criminal courts. Some Albany lawmakers want all of them treated as children in Family Court instead. They're pressing to include a measure to accomplish that as part of state budget negotiations.They want separate facilities for those sentenced to serve time, saying that separating them from criminals 18 and over in prison would lower the recidivism rate for the younger offenders.Lowering the age of criminal responsibility would lead to shorter sentences for the younger offenders. Opponents of the measure, however, warn about a blanket policy that treats every 16- and 17-year-old offenderas a child. They want judges to be able to decide who to treat as adults in cases involving serious crimeslike murder or sexual assault. The two sides are still negotiating. State Sen. Pat Gallivan, a Republican from Elma, says such a broad proposal may not be necessary because New York state usually treats 16- and 17-year-old defendants differently than adults. When you have roughly 30,000 individuals arrested a year for crimes that are 16 or 17, over 95 percent of them do not result in a criminal conviction,Gallivan said at a news conference. Only 1.5 percent of them ultimately go to state prison. So, I would make an argument that we are already treating them differently. Is Gallivan right on the numbers? A commission's report The senators data comes from a 2014 report by Gov. Andrew M. Cuomos Commission on Youth, Public Safety, and Justice. The commission convened to make recommendations on raising the age of criminal responsibility. The report shows about 33,000 cases resolved in 2013, with almost 2.7 percent receiving a sentence to state prison. That data has since been updated by the state Division of Criminal Justice Services, which reported close to 35,000resolved cases involving 16- and 17-year-old defendants in 2013. Only 1,689 cases, or 4.8 percent, resulted in a criminal conviction, according to the data. Some 5,215 other cases resulted in a youth offender adjudication, given when someone is found guilty but a judge seals the record at sentencing. In all, 838 cases resulted in a state prison sentence, 2.4 percent of the cases resolved that year. Some 1,808 cases, about 5 percent, resulted in a jail sentence for lesser convictions. Defendants in the remaining cases were either found not guilty or received different sentences like probation or a fine. Or else they received a conditional discharge, allowing them to avoid incarceration or other punishment as long as they complied with conditions set by the court. More recent data There were 24,572 cases resolved involving 16- and 17-year-old defendants in 2016. Only 1,012 cases, or 4.1 percent, resulted in a criminal conviction. Some 3,802 resulted in a youthful offender adjudication. The state said 581 cases, or 2.4 percent of all cases, resulted in a state prison sentence, while 1,072 cases resulted in a local jail sentence. Our ruling Gallivan, a former Erie County sheriff and captain in the State Police, said of 30,000 individuals arrested a year for crimes that are 16 or 17, over 95 percent of them do not result in a criminal conviction. Only 1.5 percent of them ultimately go to state prison. State data shows close to 96 percent of cases involving 16- and 17-year-old defendants did not result in a criminal conviction last year. Only 2.4 percent of these cases received sentences to state prison. That drops to less than 1.5percent if you exclude youth offenderadjudications.The state says both categories of offenders should be included in sentencing data. Gallivan is slightly off on the numbers, but his claim that few of these cases result in a conviction - and even fewer receive a state prison sentence - is correct. His statement is accurate but needs additional information.",0.8,0.2,1.0,0.7,0.0,0.1,0.3,0.9,0.7,Mostly True

Final Rating: Mostly True  ",Women of childbearing age spend 68 percent more in out-of-pocket health care costs than men.,"The Supreme Court recently decided Burwell vs. Hobby Lobby -- a landmark decision in which a 5-4 majority ruled that a closely held, private corporation could decline, on religious grounds, to pay for certain kinds of contraceptives otherwise mandated in employee health coverage by the Affordable Care Act. The decision was a victory for supporters of religious freedom and a defeat for backers of expanded reproductive health care. The unveiling of the decision on June 30, 2014, produced widespread commentary and debate over its merits. Associate Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburgs stinging dissent attracted wide attention from those who opposed the majority opinion. We noticed the following claim in Ginsburgs dissent: Women of childbearing age spend 68 percent more in out-of-pocket health care costs than men. We thought it would be interesting to see how that statistic was calculated. But when we looked into it, we were in for a surprise: The 68 percent figure was a lot older than wed expected. Where the statistic came from In her dissent, Ginsburg cited the statistic as being from a statement of Sen. Feinstein, which appears to refer to a Senate floor speech by Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif. During the debate on President Barack Obamas Affordable Care Act in December 2009, Feinstein said, The fact is, women have different health needs than men, and these needs often generate additional costs. Women of childbearing age spend 68 percent more in out-of-pocket health care costs than men. Most people don't know that, but it is actually true. The 68 percent statistic has been cited repeatedly in the judicial debate over the contraceptive mandate in the health care law. In the Hobby Lobby case alone, it was cited in briefs by the Obama administration, as well as in an amicus, or friend-of-the-court, brief by 91 Democratic members of Congress and a separate amicus brief by the National Womens Law Center. We found a flurry of references to the statistic in court cases, bills, and reports in 2014, 2013, 2012, 2009, 2003, 2002, 1999 and 1998. After a lot of digging, PolitiFact was able to trace the 68 percent figure back to a publication released by the Womens Research & Education Institute titled, Women's Health Care Costs and Experiences. That study was published in 1994 -- and if 1994 was the publication year, its reasonable to assume that the data in question are even older than that. (We couldnt find the full report online, and inquiries to the group and to the original author were not answered.) Is there newer data? Could Ginsburg -- or anyone else who cited the 68 percent statistic in recent years -- have used more up-to-date data? Yes. PolitiFact asked officials at the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality -- a part of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services -- to walk us through the data in the Medical Expenditures Panel Survey, which is the source several independent experts had suggested we use to test Ginsburgs statistic. It turns out that for 2011, women between 18 and 44 had out-of-pocket expenses that averaged 69 percent higher than men of the same age range. Thats virtually indistinguishable from what Ginsburg said. Still, its worth noting that alternative data comes up with somewhat lower estimates. Data from a different HHS source -- National Health Expenditure Accounts -- found that in 2010, women between 19 and 44 had 52 percent greater out-of-pocket spending than men of the same age range. And an annual study by the Health Care Cost Institute, which is based on information supplied by private health insurance companies, found an even smaller gender gap. In 2012, women's out-of-pocket expenses were 36 percent higher than men's. However, this figure is for all women through age 65, rather than just childbearing age, so its not an apples-to-apples comparison. The experts we checked with didnt doubt that women of childbearing age tend to pay more out of their pocket for health care. Women under 65 use a lot more health services than do men, especially preventive care, screenings and well-care, all of which is covered less by insurance than hospital expenditures, said Gail Wilensky, who headed Medicare and Medicaid under President George H.W. Bush. Still, there are indications that the gap is narrowing between men and women, perhaps because the insurance market has changed substantially over the past 20-plus years, with cost-sharing becoming much more significant than it was in 1994. The annual Kaiser Family Foundation/Health Research & Educational Trust study found a rising percentage of workers with employer-provided health coverage facing an annual deductible of $1,000 or more. The share of people in that category rose from 10 percent in 2006 to 38 percent in 2013 -- a far shorter time horizon than 20 years. Meanwhile, data from HHS national accounts series shows that out-of-pocket spending for men grew faster than it did for women between 2002 and 2010 -- a 3.9 percent growth rate for men, compared with 3.3 percent for women, Tanner said. The significance of an old statistic We cant be 100 percent sure that by citing Feinstein, Ginsburg was simply relying on a very old statistic without further checking. However, given the long history of the identical number being used, we suspect the statistic was repeated, in most or all cases, without being checked against more recent data. Ginsburg did not respond to an inquiry for this story sent through the Supreme Courts public information office; justices rarely if ever comment to the media. In any case, we found repeated mentions of this statistic by advocates, lawmakers and government officials without citing the original 1994 source, leaving the incorrect impression that the number was current. Our ruling Ginsburg wrote that women of childbearing age spend 68 percent more in out-of-pocket health care costs than men. Some estimates cited by a litany of politicians and advocates are based on 20-year-old data. But more recent data shows that women do still pay more out of pocket for health care than men do, with one estimate very close -- 69 percent -- and other estimates in the 40 percent to 50 percent range.",1.0,0.2,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.1,0.5,0.2,0.5,Mostly True

Final Rating: Mostly True  ",Says a portfolio managed by the Texas General Land Office earned 22 percent last year while the states emergency reserve account experienced a 1 percent gain.,"Criticizing a poke at his not releasing millions of dollars to support public schools, Texas Land Commissioner Jerry Patterson said that doing so might cut into double-digit returns on investments managed by the General Land Office.In a letter he made public Aug. 22, 2012, Patterson, a Republican, said that those who want him to transfer $300 million in investment earnings to the State Board of Education for school needs do not understand the value of keeping such money invested so the states education endowment, the Permanent School Fund, continues to gain value.A pro-Democratic group, Progress Texas, accuses Patterson of inappropriately hoarding the millions. Patterson counters that the School Land Board, which he chairs, has discretion over whether to transfer the money and, he told us by telephone, it has until September 2013 to decide. His spokesman, Jim Suydam, also told us by email that the board approved a resolution in early 2011 to release $250 million of earnings in both 2012 and 2013 to the State Board of Education.In his letter, Patterson said that draining off additional earnings as Progress Texas says he must is a bad choice... because last year the GLO-managed PSF earned 22 percent and, due to statutory liquidity requirements, the rainy day fund earned just 1 percent. He was comparing the portion of the Permanent School Fund managed by the land office to earnings on the states savings account, otherwise known as the Economic Stabilization Fund. If your family needed a quick infusion of cash, Patterson wrote, would you withdraw cash from the investment account earning 22 percent or the account earning 1 percent?Were not venturing that question, but wondered if Patterson made an accurate earnings comparison.Starting in 2005, the land office was given the authority to invest in real estate using proceeds received from selling lands or drawing on revenue from Permanent School Fund mineral leases and royalties, the agency notes on a web page. Professional fund management firms oversee the investments, the agency says, while the land board, consisting of the commissioner and two citizen appointees, manages the sale of Permanent School Fund land and mineral leases.To our inquiry, Suydam provided an agency report to the Legislature stating that through March 2012, the market value of the agencys investments made from the Permanent School Fund was $3.077 billion, about half of that reflecting externally managed direct real estate investments and nearly $1.2 billion attributable to short-term investments in the states treasury, which Suydam later said means money set aside so its on call for the agencys real estate investments.The report, dated Sept. 1, 2012, says that gross time-weighted returns on the portfolio in the 12 months through March amounted to nearly 22.9 percent, though that is without considering the short-term investments. Counting the cash-on-call portion, the report says, the time-weighted returns on the portfolio were 13.03 percent.Time-weighted returns?By email, Suydam told us the term describes a complex calculation that uses values for every day in the period being measured which, he said, explains why the 23 percent return shown for the real estate investments does not align with the 30 percent return that we calculated by comparing the market value of those investments at the end of March 2012 to the comparable figure at the end of March 2011.Asked how the earnings on real estate through March 2012 compare to recent 12-month periods, Suydam said such investments generated nearly 14 percent in market value in the 12 months through March 2011, but lost about 15 percent in the 12 months through March 2010.We checked on the rainy day funds earnings with Lauren Willis, spokeswoman for State Comptroller Susan Combs, who oversees state finances.Willis said by email that money in the reserve fund, created in 1988, is invested like other funds in the states treasury in stable, high-quality investments. In 2011, Willis said, the average yield on all those funds was 0.74 percent -- generating nearly $194 million in interest income including $51.9 million added to the rainy day fund. R.J. DeSilva, another Combs spokesman, said by email the rate of return might or might not have been about the same through the 12 months running through March 2012.In a telephone interview, we asked Patterson about why his letter mentions the higher returns on the real estate investments alone rather than also taking into account the lower returns influenced by the agencys cash-on-call funds.I dont count the cash, Patterson replied, because its not part of our investment portfolio.The land office, Patterson noted, is limited by law to managing just part of the overall education endowment. Suydam later said by email that as of the end of March, the market value of the agencys portion of the PSF, not including the value of minerals or state-owned land, was nearly $3.1 billion. He said the State Board of Education oversaw the funds remaining $25.6 billion.Our rulingPattersons reference to 22 percent in earnings over the 12 months running through March 2012 does not account for reduced earnings from nearly $1.2 billion in cash-on-call money supporting the agencys real estate investments. That clarification would be helpful, though it still seems reasonable, overall, to focus on the portion of the portfolio that would be expected to reap sizable gains. Separately, the claim seems to reflect the annual earnings on the rainy day fund, though the commissioners March-to-March time period does not match the calendar-year approach used by the state comptroller.",0.8,0.2,1.0,0.9,0.0,0.1,0.3,0.6,0.7,Mostly True

Final Rating: Mostly True  ","Says Paul Ryan voted for two wars that were unpaid for, voted for the Bush tax cuts that were unpaid for, voted for the prescription drug bill that cost as much as my health care bill -- but wasn't paid for.","In closed-door remarks to campaign supporters on April 14, 2011, President Barack Obama looked back in frustration at lengthy negotiations with Republicans over funding to keep the federal government operating.Obama opined, as a CBS News online story reported, that he expects Republicans to continue using the budget process to enact their political agenda under the guise of cutting spending.The president singled out U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis., the House Budget Committee chairman who has authored a long-term deficit-reduction plan.When Paul Ryan says his priority is to make sure, you know, he's just being America's accountant, trying to be responsible ...This is the same guy who voted for two wars that were unpaid for, voted for the Bush tax cuts that were unpaid for, voted for the prescription drug bill that cost as much as my health care bill -- but wasn't paid for, Obama told his supporters. So it's not on the level.In making the remark, Obama pointed to several big-ticket items approved during the Bush administration while Ryan was in Congress -- ones he says have helped drive the nations record deficits.Given the prominence of the protagonists and the timeliness of the comments, we decided to take a look at Obamas critique of Ryan.With the words, Obama is offering an opinion about how Ryan has framed his budget-cutting efforts. We cant fact-check the presidents opinion about Ryans message. But we can focus on the factual assertions, and try to put them into some context.We started with the White House, which declined to comment, saying the presidents remarks spoke for themselves.Lets look at the votes.There is no dispute Ryan voted for Afghanistan and Iraq war funding; for the major tax cuts enacted under President George W. Bush in 2001 and 2003 (and extended in 2010); and for the new Medicare prescription drug benefit created in 2003.All were big-ticket items.But Obama goes a step further to assert that all were unpaid for. Thats Washington parlance for bills not offset by corresponding spending cuts or tax increases elsewhere in the federal budget.Budget experts we consulted and the historical record confirm there were no direct offsets built into those bills.Obamas claim on the prescription drug bill was slightly different -- that it wasnt paid for and cost as much as my health care bill.Lets break this into two parts.Obama appears to refer to the gross outlays needed for the two landmark bills.For the Medicare prescription drug bill, passed in 2003 and effective in 2006, we found a range of cost estimates for 10 years: $395 billion to $720 billion. The official Congressional Budget Office estimate was the low end.That was at the time. Now, government estimates show the original cost projections were too high, perhaps by as much as 40 percent, said Jon Gabel, senior fellow in health care research at the National Opinion Research Center.Obamas health reform bill -- the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act -- was pricier, with estimates in the $800 billion to $1.4 trillion range. Ryan and Republicans opposed the bill.But the two measures were passed seven years apart, so inflation may be a factor.Paul Van de Water, a former Congressional Budget Office official who is now a senior fellow with the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, did an inflation-adjusted comparison and found the Medicare bill is probably two-thirds or three-quarters the cost of the Obama health care measure.That is, Obamas health care bill is still hundreds of millions of dollars more costly than the Medicare drug bill.So the president was off in equating the gross cost of the bills.On the offset question, the Medicare prescription drug bill, however, indisputably added to the federal deficit. It was not offset by new revenue or other spending cuts.In contrast, the official government estimate of the 2010 health care laws impact said it would actually reduce the deficit, in part because of the new taxes it enacts to help offset the cost of expanding health coverage.The source for that is the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.The CBOs estimate is hardly undisputed -- Ryan, other Republican leaders and various budget analysts have argued that the CBOs report was skewed by questionable assumptions given to it by the Obama administration. They contend the law would actually add to the deficit.Nevertheless, we -- and Congress -- have used CBO estimates as the gold standard on such matters. So Obama has a pretty firm leg to stand on in saying his health bill was paid for while the Medicare bill was not.That covers the details behind the presidents remarks. In this case, its important to put them into their proper context. We consulted several experts and sought Ryans take.Ryan was asked in a recent interview about Obamas citing the Medicare drug program, the two wars and the Bush tax cuts as major drivers of the deficit.He disagreed: We still had these enormous, building, unfunded liabilities, Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security -- I mean, the big drivers of our debt.His office sent us a defense of his votes on war funding, quoting his budget plan: Like all categories of government spending, defense spending should be executed with greater efficiency and accountability. But responsible budgeting must never lose sight of the fact that the first responsibility of the federal government is to provide for the defense of the nation.On the Bush tax cuts, Ryan aides said the congressman believes that we have deficits because Washington spends too much, not because Americans are taxed too little. He says the tax cuts helped fuel economic growth and bring in more tax revenue.Indeed, in December, Obama himself backed a compromise with Republicans, including Ryan, that extended the Bush tax cuts.Bottom line: Ryan has voted for massive new spending and so has the president, said Tad DeHaven, a budget analyst at the libertarian Cato Institute.Iraq war costs have topped $1 trillion, said Scott Lilly, former staff director for the House Appropriations Committee and now a research fellow at the left-leaning Center for American Progress. Neither Bushs war effort in Afghanistan nor Obamas escalation there has been paid for, both analysts noted.In April, both Obama and Ryan unveiled long-term deficit reduction plans in the neighborhood of $4 trillion over a decade or more.So where does this leave us?The president cherry-picked a handful of votes in an effort to show that Ryan is not pristine on the subject of the deficit.Obama got it right on Ryans support for the big-ticket bills, including war funding, Medicare prescription drugs and the Bush tax cuts. He was also on target in saying that none was offset or paid for by spending cuts or tax increases. Thats the main part of his claim.He was off the mark in asserting that one of the bills -- Medicare prescription drugs -- was as costly as his 2010 health care reform bill.That puts him at Mostly True.",0.8,0.2,1.0,0.7,0.1,0.3,0.5,1.0,0.9,Mostly True

Final Rating: Mostly True  ",The United States has the highest corporate tax rate in the free world.,"Pundits dont just disagree about what tax rates should be; they also disagree about how high they actually are. On Fox Newss The Five, hosts Bob Beckel and Eric Bolling came down on either side while discussing how the economy has fared under President Barack Obama. America has the most number of deductions available to corporations, Beckel said. They pay lower taxes than a lot of European countries do, and under Obama, I have not seen corporate taxes go up all that much. Just to fact-check you a little bit, responded Bolling, we have the highest corporate tax rate in the free world. Beckel repeated his point, then Bolling pointed towards Pfizer and Burger King going overseas for what he called tax inversion. Theyre going there specifically to capture a lower corporate income tax, said Bolling. We separately checked Beckels claim about deductions, but in this check, well see whether Bolling is correct that the United States corporate tax rate ranks as the highest in the free world. The rate in theory We decided to focus on the countries that belong to the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development, a group that includes most advanced, industrialized nations. That fits our bill for a proxy for the free world. Out of the 34 countries in the OECD, America ranks first with a 39.1 percent corporate tax rate, compared to an OECD average of 24.1 percent. The OECD figure is whats called the statutory rate, meaning the base rate applied to corporate profits. According to the Tax Foundation, two non-OECD countries -- the United Arab Emirates (55 percent) and Chad (40 percent) -- have a greater statutory rate than the United States. But the UAE is governed by a monarchy and Chad is a developing country, so we dont think they would fit into the free world category Bolling used. The rate in practice PolitiFact, our sister site, has looked at several variations on Bollings claim and ruled them Mostly True almost every time. The reason for the mostly qualifier is that companies arent actually taxed at the statutory rate. Tax deductions -- on health insurance, pensions, and investment returns, for example -- allow corporations to reduce the pool of taxable profits. So economists often look at what they call the effective tax rate, which experts have told us is just as valid a measurement of corporate tax rates as the statutory rate. But whereas the statutory rate is relatively straightforward and uncontroversial, different, reputable organizations have published very different estimates of the effective tax rate that corporations pay. The most recent estimate comes from the World Bank and International Finance Commission, which put the United States effective rate for 2014 at 27.9 percent. Thats second-highest behind New Zealand among OECD countries and 15th-highest among the 189 countries measured. In 2011, the Tax Foundation published a survey of 13 prior estimates of the United States effective tax rate from 2005 to 2011. All 13 studies pegged the U.S.s rate as above average, but none had the U.S. rate first overall. Another 2011 study by the Congressional Research Service put the U.S. effective rate at 27.1 percent, slightly lower than the OECD average of 27.7 percent. Taxes are convoluted Different studies disagree on effective corporate tax rates because corporate tax rates tend to vary widely depending on the industry, said Alan Viola, resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute. The biggest deduction that varies across countries is how generous the depreciation schedule is, said Alan Viard, resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute. When a business does an investment, equipment, a building, they dont normally get to deduct the whole cost that year. They have to do it over time. Faster is better, said Viard, but depreciation rates vary depending on what types of equipment a company is buying. Many studies also dont account for what the United States classifies as S-corporations, meaning businesses that pay tax through the individual income-tax system rather than the corporate income-tax system, Viard said. This represents about 30 percent of American companies, he said. So while effective tax rates are a good estimate of the corporate tax burden in the United States, particular businesses burden may vary. Our ruling Bolling said the United States has the highest corporate tax rate in the free world. He was referring to the statutory rate, meaning the rate before deductions. On that score, hes right: The United States does have the highest statutory rate among developed countries. However, the United States corporate tax rate doesnt appear to be the highest once deductions and other exclusions are taken into account. So Bolling is correct by one valid definition.",1.0,0.2,1.0,0.8,0.0,0.1,0.5,1.0,0.6,Mostly True

Final Rating: Mostly True  ",Says Donald Trump has bankrupt four separate businesses.,"U.S. Sen. Mark Warner says presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton has a lot of ammunition to fire at Donald Trumps business record. To think that Mr. Trump is trying to lay out this proposition that hes a successful business guy. Hes failed miserably, bankrupt four separate businesses, Warner, D-Va., said during a June 21 interview on CNN. We looked at Warners contention that Trump bankrupted four businesses. Clinton has made similar charges against the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, including on July 6 when she spoke in front of the shuttered Trump Plaza Casino and Hotel in Atlantic City, N.J.. Earlier this year, many of Trumps GOP primary opponents also accused him of running businesses into the ground. Kevin Hall, Warners communications director, sent us a series of media reports about Trumps business problems. Some Trump companies indeed have sought protection under Chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy law, which shields businesses from creditors as as they reorganize with hope of remaining open. Under court supervision, the companies devise a plan to pay back some of its liabilities over time. Thats different from a Chapter 7 filing, which involves liquidating a companys assets and distributing the proceeds to creditors. PolitiFact National has explored several claims about Trumps business record and has tallied a list of bankruptcies for his companies. Lets take a look. 1991 bankruptcy Trumps first bankruptcy came when he sought protection for the Trump Taj Mahal in Atlantic City. Trump funded most of the casinos $1 billion construction by using junk bonds with high interest rates, according to the Philadelphia Inquirer. When it sought Chapter 11 protection a year after its opening, the casino had about $3 billion in debt. As part of the restructuring, Trump cut his ownership stake in the Taj Mahal by half and sold his airline as well as his personal 282-foot yacht, The Washington Post said in an August 2015 story. 1992 bankruptcies Two more of Trumps Atlantic City casinos - the Trump Castle and Trump Plaza and Casino - sought Chapter 11 protection amid heavy debt and cash flow problems, United Press International reported at the time. A fourth bankruptcy also occurred in 1992 when Trump sought protection for The Plaza hotel in midtown Manhattan. The hotel, which Trump bought for $390 million in 1988, had accumulated more than $550 million in debt. Trump gave up a 49 percent ownership stake and remained CEO, although he had little control over the day-to-day operations of the company, according to The New York Times. Most recent bankruptcies Trump Hotels and Casinos Resorts filed for bankruptcy in 2004 when his casinos - including the Trump Taj Mahal, Trump Marina and Trump Plaza in Atlantic City, and a riverboat casino in Indiana - amassed an estimated $1.8 billion in debt, according to The Associated Press. Trump agreed to reduce his share in the company from 47 percent to 27 percent in a restructuring plan, but he still was the companys largest single shareholder and remained in charge of its operations. Several years later, Trump Entertainment Resorts - formerly Trump Hotels and Casinos Resorts - was slammed by the Great Recession and missed a $53.1 million interest payment in December 2008, according to ABC News. The company declared Chapter 11 in February 2009. After negotiating with the board of directors, Trump resigned as the companys chairman and had his corporate stake in the company reduced to 10 percent. The company continued to use Trumps name in licensing. All told, the record shows that three of Trumps Atlantic City casinos as well as The Plaza hotel went bankrupt in the 1990s. His overall casino and resort company went bankrupt twice in the 2000s while operating under different names. So you could argue that five Trump companies have gone into bankruptcy. Beyond the numbers The next question: Is Trump personally to blame for driving these ventures into bankruptcy, as Warners statement says? Trump defends his use of bankruptcy laws, saying theyve allowed him to keep businesses afloat and that hes rarely relied on them during a career of making hundreds of business deals. In a statement released the day Clinton made her Atlantic City trip, Trump pegged the number of bankruptcies at four.  It is an effective and commonly used practice in business to use bankruptcy proceedings to restructure a business and ultimately save jobs, Trump said in a July 6 statement.  Experts told PolitiFact National last September that Trump has had a high number of bankruptcies. But they didnt entirely blame him for the Chapter 11 filings and noted that most occurred in the gambling industry, which has struggled. A 1991 article by United Press International about the financial woes of the Trump Castle and Trump Plaza and Casino said the Atlantic City gaming industry was depressed and that nine of the citys 12 casinos saw declining revenues in 1990, with those two Trump casinos seeing the biggest revenue losses. The New York Times noted in a story earlier this month that Trumps share of the overall Atlantic City casino market started to fall in 1997, and that while revenues for non-Trump gaming ventures in the city rose over the following five years, revenue at Trump casinos declined. Trump told the newspaper that his casinos ran into trouble because they began competing against each other - a statement that The Times said was a tacit acknowledgement that he overbuilt. Roger Gros, publisher of Global Gaming Business magazine, told the Los Angeles Times last year that Trump put his Atlantic City casinos in so much debt that subsequent managers couldn't manage them properly. But Michael Viscount, an Atlantic City lawyer who represented unsecured creditors during the 2004 Chapter 11 filing of the Trump Hotels and Casino resorts, doesnt blame Trump for the bankruptcies. He told Forbes magazine in 2011 that he didnt blame Trump for his Atlantic City casino bankruptcies. Viscount said creditors knew what they were getting into when they lent Trump money. Theyve all played this game before, in the insolvency space. The company that possessed his name filed bankruptcy because it was overleveraged, Viscount told Forbes. What does that tell you? People want to lend him money. He does grandiose things with it. Adam Levitin, a law professor at Georgetown University, said in an August 2015 post on a blog dedicated to bankruptcy and credit issues that a Chapter 11 filing alone doesnt demonstrate a lack of business acumen. Sometimes businesses go bankrupt because of poor management, but sometimes its because of factors beyond their control, Levitin wrote. And indeed, how much, if at all, was Trump involved in the management of the companies? Levitin wrote. I wouldn't be shocked if he was basically licensing his name. Levitin told PolitiFact National last September that its not fair to put all the blame on Trump for his companys bankruptcies because hes acted as any investor would. Investors often own many non-integrated companies, which they fund by taking on debt, and some of them inevitably file for bankruptcy, Levitin said. The only difference is that Trump puts his name on his companies, which means people associate them with him, but he's not at all the leader in the bankruptcy space, Levitin said. These bankruptcies were not defining moments for Trump and shouldn't color our view of him. Our ruling Warner said Trump has bankrupt four separate businesses. The number, if anything, is conservative. We count five. But beyond the number, Warners statement also asserts that Trump was the cause of the bankruptcies, and thats harder to parse out. Theres no doubt he had a role in many of the failings, having larded his casino operations with huge debts. But analysts note that Trump wasnt acting alone; he had willing investors who put up big sums of money in the risky gaming industry. Theres also questions about how involved he was in running all of the casinos that bore his name.",1.0,0.2,1.0,0.8,0.1,0.2,0.5,1.0,0.8,Mostly True

Final Rating: Mostly True  ","Says Beto ORourke crashed into barriers, causing a collision while driving drunk, then fleeing the scene to avoid accountability.","Editors note: This is one of four fact-checks featuring a claim made in Club for Growths TV ad about Beto ORourke. To read the others, click here. El Paso Democrat Beto ORourke, who announced Thursday that he is running for president, had been teasing a presidential bid for weeks. Speculation about his intentions prompted the conservative Club for Growth to release a television ad looking to weaken enthusiasm for ORourke among Democratic primary voters. The ad argues that ORourke has coasted through life due to white male privilege and that he is a far cry from former President Barack Obama, as many have drawn comparisons between the two Democrats. Obama went on to become the first African American editor of the Harvard Law Review, breaking barriers, the ad says. Beto crashed into them, causing a collision while driving drunk, then fleeing the scene to avoid accountability. Club for Growth provided a fact sheet detailing the source for each statement in the advertisement. Sources include newspaper articles and other sources online. ORourke did not return a request for comment. OUR PROCESS: Read howPolitiFact checks everyone. Police report details accident We looked at this incident in September last year and earlier, after allegations about his 1998 arrest were made during his 2018 Senate campaign and his 2012 congressional campaign. Here are the facts: ORourke was arrested in 1998 for driving while intoxicated in Anthony, a small town in El Paso County. A witness told police officers that they saw ORourke driving at a high speed on I-10 before losing control of his car and striking a truck traveling in the same direction, according to a police report of the incident published by the Houston Chronicle. The truck was sent across the center median and into the lane moving in the opposite direction. ORourke then attempted to drive away, but the witness stopped him. Law enforcement arrived at the scene and arrested ORourke. Police reported that ORourke recorded a 0.136 and 0.134 on police breathalyzers, above a blood-alcohol level of 0.10, the state legal limit at the time. Our ruling Club for Growth said ORourke crashed into barriers, causing a collision while driving drunk, then fleeing the scene to avoid accountability. A police report of the incident states that ORourke crashed into another car while driving under the influence of alcohol. A witness said he attempted to flee the scene, but was unsuccessful.

Final Rating: Mostly True  ","Despite attention on global warming, fewer Americans carpool today to work than carpooled in 1980 and SUVs have never been a larger proportion of the vehicles being sold in this country.","The two-week climate conference now under way in Paris, where President Barack Obama hopes for an international agreement to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, has generated attacks from conservatives such as syndicated columnist George Will. On Nov. 30, 2015, the first day of the United Nations gathering, Will made a two-part claim that we want to check. He made the statement on Fox News Special Report, and it was replayed the next day by Milwaukee radio talk show host Charlie Sykes, whose guests are nearly always fellow conservatives. Despite 30 years of propaganda about global warming, Will stated, fewer Americans carpool today to work than carpooled in 1980. SUVs have never been a larger proportion of the vehicles being sold in this country. The American people may profess occasionally to be concerned about global warming, but their behavior tells you that none of this propaganda has had any effect. The size of the cars Americans drive and how often they carpool are only two ways in which people produce greenhouse gases -- those such as carbon dioxide from vehicles that trap heat in the atmosphere and, scientists believe, contribute to global warming. But lets see how clean Wills claim is. Greenhouse gases A little first on greenhouse gases. When Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker stated in September 2015 that the Obama administrations own Environmental Protection Agency has said its Clean Power Plan will have a marginal impact on climate change (Half True), we noted that the United States and China are considered the worlds top greenhouse gas polluters. And as PolitiFact National reported the same month, the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has said it is extremely likely that humans are causing climate change, and very likely that greenhouses gases are the driver.  Weve also noted that according to the EPA, greenhouse gas emissions from vehicles in the United States amount to 27 percent of all sources of greenhouse gases, second only to electric power generation. Now to the first part of Wills claim. Carpooling The latest census figures show that slightly more than 9 percent of Americans carpooled to work in 2014. As Will suggested, thats down from nearly 20 percent in 1980, which was the first census to survey about carpooling. Driving alone rose from 64.4 percent to 76.5 percent. Among the reasons, according to experts: The rate of car ownership has risen, work schedules are less predictable, more people work from home and busier Americans want more freedom in managing their commutes with other tasks, such as getting kids to soccer practice. The other part of Wills statement, however, goes off road a bit. SUVs Well note that, strictly speaking, there are traditional sport-utility vehicles, such as the Jeep Grand Cherokee and Dodge Durango, which are built on a truck platform; and the newer crossover-utility vehicles, which are built on a car chassis. They include the Honda CR-V and the Buick Encore. Traditional SUVs peaked with a 17 percent market share in 2002, according to the Ann Arbor, Mich.-based Center for Automotive Research, an independent research group. In 2014, they made up only 7.1 percent of all new vehicle sales. But many people, as well as automotive experts, refer to both types of vehicles simply as SUVs. The car site Edmunds.com told us that SUVs have reached their highest-ever market share in 2015, at 35.5 percent of sales. And the Center for Automotive Research provided us similar figures. In 2014, traditional SUVs and crossovers accounted for 34 percent of new-vehicle sales, as high as any year going back to 1995. Our rating Will said that despite attention on global warming, fewer Americans carpool today to work than carpooled in 1980 and SUVs have never been a larger proportion of the vehicles being sold in this country. Will is correct on carpooling to work and essentially correct on SUVs, when taking into account both traditional SUVs and the smaller crossover vehicles. But its worth noting that the market share for the traditional SUVs is down from its peak in 2002. ",0.7,0.5,1.0,0.7,0.0,0.5,0.6,1.0,0.6,Mostly True

Final Rating: True  ","Since that famous day in February where the governor campaigned with Barack Obama on behalf of the stimulus program, 211,000 Floridians have lost their jobs.","You knew it wouldn't take long for the hug to get some love during Sunday's debate between Republicans Marco Rubio and Charlie Crist. Minutes into the 40-minute Florida Senate Showdown, Rubio made a case that he'll stand up to President Barack Obama's agenda and Crist won't.Everyone knows that you won't stand up to the Obama agenda because just a year ago you were campaigning for it, the former House speaker said, referring to Feb. 10, 2009, when Crist embraced the president at a Fort Myers campaign event for the federal stimulus package.We've fact-checked several claims about Crist's support for the stimulus. Indeed, he earned a Pants on Fire rating for saying he didn't endorse it. So it was a Rubio comment later in the program that drew our attention. FOX News Sunday host Chris Wallace asked Rubio, Why is $8 billion and 87,000 jobs bad for a state that has 12 percent unemployment?Well ... if it's bad for America, it can't possibly be good for your state, Rubio said. Let me tell you why the stimulus has failed. The stimulus has failed because since that famous day in February where the governor campaigned with Barack Obama on behalf of the stimulus program, 211,000 Floridians have lost their jobs.211,000 is a big number, so we wanted to check Rubio's facts.Conveniently, the state's Agency for Workforce Innovation released a report on state employment figures just two days before the debate. In it, Florida's record 12.2 percent unemployment rate is announced, along with many statistics on the state's jobs picture, including year-over-year numbers from February 2009, the month Crist campaigned with Obama. The report shows Florida had 8,356,000 jobs in February 2009 and 8,125,000 in February 2010, the difference being 231,000. These are the seasonally adjusted numbers for the civilian population.However, if you look at seasonally adjusted nonagricultural employment --- a less-inclusive number --- you see the basis for Rubio's claim. There the job loss in a year's time is 211,500.It's the latter number that the Rubio campaign points to. Spokesman Alberto Martinez also shared a report from House Way and Means Republicans that seeks to highlight the stimulus as a job-killer, rather than a job creator, where Florida is said to have lost 240,400 jobs since the stimulus passed.Like any statistics, these are easily sliced and diced to make the key point. But Rubio is very close to the precise number, and in fact, he underestimates it slightly when his point is that Florida has lost a lot of jobs.

Final Rating: True  ","In Afghanistan, over 100 billion dollars spent on military contracts.","The debate over how the United States left Afghanistan, and the chaos it created, will likely last for years. So will the debate over the war itself, and whether nearly 20 years of deployment was worth it. Lt. Gov. Mandela Barnes of Wisconsin, one of at least 10 Democrats hoping to win the seat held by Republican U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson, made his position clear in an Aug. 16, 2021 tweet: Thousands of American lives lost, plus over 100,000 Afghan civilians and military personnel. Over 100 billion dollars spent on military contracts. And for what? The cost in human lives has been well documented. Here are the stark totals as reported that same day by The Associated Press: American service members killed in Afghanistan through April: 2,448. U.S. contractors: 3,846. Afghan national military and police: 66,000. Other allied service members, including from other NATO member states: 1,144. Afghan civilians: 47,245. Taliban and other opposition fighters: 51,191. Aid workers: 444. Journalists: 72. Those casualty totals tragically increased August 26, 2021, when a suicide bomber attacked crowds of Afghans flocking to Kabuls airport. The attacks killed at least 169 Afghans and 13 U.S. troops, Afghan and U.S. officials said. The death toll could rise as authorities examine the scene. On August 30, 2021, the last plane carrying U.S. forces left Afghanistan after 20 years of war. But were focused on the second part of Barnes tweet, and his claim about money spent on military contracts. Has more than $100 billion dollars been spent on military contracts? Lets take a look. When asked for back up for the statement, Barnes spokesman Christian Slater pointed us to a April 23, 2021 Bloomberg Law report which found that Since 2002, the Pentagon has spent $107.9 billion on contracted services in Afghanistan, a Bloomberg Government analysis shows. Contractor support includes lodging, laundry, private security, mechanics, food, transportation, equipment maintenance, and fuel, according to the article. Texas-based Fluor was the biggest defense contractor in Afghanistan. The Defense Department had spent $3.8 billion for Fluors work in Afghanistan since 2015, federal records show, mainly for logistics services, according to an Associated Press report. A Bloomberg report noted that in April 2021, 16,832 workers were employed by contractors in Afghanistan, with 6,147 of them being U.S. citizens. That was more than double the remaining 2,500 U.S. troops at the time. According to a July 21, 2021 US News & World Report article, the number of contractors in Afghanistan dropped over the previous three months from nearly 17,000 in April to 7,800 in July. Here is Bloombergs list of top Department of Defense contractors for fiscal years 2016-2021.  Fluor Corp.: $3.1 billion Amentum Parent Holdings: $1.7 billion Columbia Helicopters: $970 million PAE: $930 million Raytheon Technologies: $830 million Secure Movement Logistics: $680 million National Fuel: $480 million Boeing Co.: $400 million Bravura Information Tech.: $310 million FedEx Corp.: $310 million Waste and fraud reported To be sure, all that money was not spent without controversy -- or even all spent appropriately. In an August 2021 report on Afghanistan Reconstruction, Special Inspector General John F. Sopko, noted that fraud and financial waste was rampant: Because contract work was often performed with little to no oversight, waste and fraud often went virtually unchecked. In 2012, GAO reported that a number of new, contractor- built facilities had to be repaired or completely rebuilt because oversight personnel were unable to adequately measure contractors performance, resulting in wasted resources, low morale, and risks to safety of base and installation personnel where the deficient guard towers, fire stations, and gates were constructed.  Congress created the inspector generals office as an independent agency focused on the Afghanistan mission and its reconstruction issues. Of the approximately $145 billion the U.S. government spent trying to rebuild Afghanistan, about $83 billion went to developing and sustaining its army and police forces, according to the the office. The $145 billion is in addition to $837 billion the United States spent fighting the war, which began with an invasion in October 2001. Barnes said Over 100 billion dollars spent on military contracts. A Bloomberg Law report found that the Pentagon has spent $107.9 billion on contracted services in Afghanistan. Those contracted services include lodging, laundry, food, transportation, equipment maintenance and fuel. For a statement that is accurate with nothing significant missing, our rating is True.

Final Rating: True  ",Says Mitt Romney has flip-flopped on abortion rights.,"On Fox News Sunday, Texas Gov. Rick Perry said fellow Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney has changed positions on pivotal topics, including abortion rights. You go back through my record for 20-plus years, I have been a consistent conservative, Perry told Chris Wallace on Oct. 30, 2011. Perry said he has always been pro-life, while Romney has been on both sides of that issue. Hes been ... pro-abortion, Perry said. Perry has lobbed flip-flop charges at Romney, a former Massachusetts governor, since soon after entering the presidential race. During a Sept. 22 Republican presidential debate, Perry, in a halting verbal attack, hit that idea hard, saying that Romney previously had stood up for Roe v. Wade before he was against it. Perry was referring to the 1973 landmark Supreme Court ruling that struck down a Texas law prohibiting nearly all abortions and said states could not prohibit a woman from having an abortion before a fetus is viable, the time at which it can survive outside a woman's body. So, has Romney flip-flopped on abortion rights? For another fact-check, PolitiFact National looked into that question. Romney made several statements about abortion rights earlier in his political career. Here are two of his clearest statements about his position: • In a debate during his unsuccessful 1994 challenge to U.S. Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., Romney said, I believe that abortion should be safe and legal in this country. He added: I believe that since Roe v. Wade has been the law for 20 years, it should be sustained and supported. And I sustain and support that law and support the right of a woman to make that choice. • In his successful 2002 campaign for governor, Romney said during a debate, I will preserve and protect a woman's right to choose and am devoted and dedicated to honoring my word in that regard. Those comments — made in public forums eight years apart — struck us as solid evidence that Romney was then an abortion-rights supporter. What about his views today? The issues portion of his website doesnt have a section on abortion, but Romney wrote an op-ed that was posted on the National Reviews website June 18, 2011, presenting his abortion views. It was written after he risked alienating anti-abortion activists by declining to sign a pledge offered by the Susan B. Anthony List, an anti-abortion group. The pledge includes a promise that if the signer becomes president, he will appoint pro-life candidates to head certain federal agencies such as the Justice Department and to advance legislation cutting off funding to Planned Parenthood clinics and other abortion providers. In the op-ed, Romney wrote: I am pro-life and believe that abortion should be limited to only instances of rape, incest, or to save the life of the mother. I support the reversal of Roe v. Wade, because it is bad law and bad medicine. Roe was a misguided ruling that was a result of a small group of activist federal judges legislating from the bench. I support the Hyde Amendment, which broadly bars the use of federal funds for abortions. And as president, I will support efforts to prohibit federal funding for any organization like Planned Parenthood. Romney goes on to say that if he is elected president, he will push for a law to protect unborn children who are capable of feeling pain from abortion and appoint judges who adhere to the Constitution and the laws as they are written, not as they want them to be written. Our ruling Romneys views on abortion rights today are clearly different from what he expressed in 1994 and 2002. Most significantly, Romney earlier voiced support for the Roe decision; now, he says it should be reversed.",1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,True

Final Rating: True  ",Says Your kid just ate 16 packs of sugar.,"In recent days weve heard a revival of an age-old question that highlights our nations shared love of sugar yet calls out our regional differences: Is it pop or is it soda? Or maybe its just Coke? While in bubbly debate over what to call soft drinks -- your PolitiFact Oregon staff does not agree on this -- a colleague of ours suggested a potential fact check that anyone might find intriguing, no matter what they call their carbonated beverage of choice. Youve probably seen the Sugar Packs ads around Multnomah County, put there by the Health Department as part of a healthy living and anti-obesity campaign that started in 2010.Its the one with a pile of packets of white sugar draining into a 20-ounce bottle of generic cola. Your kid just ate 16 packs of sugar, the ad states. All those extra calories can bring on obesity, diabetes and heart disease.Sixteen packets? Our collective stomachs cramped. Our teeth ached. We swallowed our distaste and started checking.Soda-sleuthing turned out to be quite easy, namely because theres a lot of pop in a newsroom. In fact, we found more than a dozen empties within spitting distance. A 12-ounce can of Coca-Cola regular, we learned, contains 39 grams of sugar, usually from high-fructose corn syrup in the United States. A 20-ounce bottle would then contain 65 grams of sugar. Corn syrup is not the same as white table sugar, but the county is talking equivalents. A packet of table sugar as shown in the ad is equal to about a teaspoon, or about 4 grams of sugar. So, indeed, there are at least 16 packs of sugar in every 20-ounce bottle of regular cola.Theres no arguing that thats a large chunk of sweet. The American Heart Association recommends no more than nine teaspoons -- nine packets -- of added sugar a day for adult men. For women, its six.But just for the fun of it -- no, were not on a sugar high -- we wanted to know what else could contain the equivalent of 16 packets of granulated white. And bingo: A 16-ounce Jamba Juice Banana Berry contains 60 grams of sugar. A 12-ounce Chocolate McCafe shake from McDonalds has 76 grams.A Starbucks Grande non-fat, no-whip Caramel Frappucino Blended Beverage contains 59 grams of sugar, although to be fair, the drink also includes 4 grams of nutritious protein. The iced lemon pound cake contains 46 grams of sugar -- but then, all you adults knew that -- and PolitiFact Oregon has fallen into tangential research.Back to the point.We figure children dont usually indulge in diet sodas, which are made with artificial sweeteners like aspartame, and not with corn syrup or sugar. Were told by a beverage trade publication that 12-ounce cans are the top sellers -- but a 20-ounce bottle doesnt seem out of line in this age of super-sized drinks and Double Big Gulps.Its whats available in our environment, said Sonia Manhas, who manages the program for the county.After all, McDonalds markets a 16-ounce soda as a small-sized soft drink and a 12-ounce drink as child-sized. We figure parents are smart enough to figure out the sugar-gram-to-cola-ounce ratio themselves. The smaller the drink, the fewer the sugar packets.All this really means is that we find the countys statement accurate. And thats the unsugar-coated truth.",1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,True

Final Rating: True",Says COVID-19 has killed more North Carolinians in a year than the flu has in 10 years.,"Like many states, North Carolina is tracking a record number of COVID-19 cases this holiday season. And in an attempt to explain the severity of the illness, the states top health official compared coronavirus deaths to data on the flu. Sadly more than 5,000 North Carolinians have lost their lives from this virus since our first death on March 12 of this year, Health Secretary Mandy Cohen said during a Dec. 1 press conference. To give some perspective, just under 1,500 people died from the flu in the past 10 years, Cohen said. In just 11 months, Covid has killed more than three times that number. Is it true that the coronavirus has killed more North Carolinians in a year than the flu has in 10 years? According to the states data, yes. North Carolinas Department of Health and Human Services tracks both COVID-19 and influenza deaths. As of Wednesday morning, the state had counted 5,284 COVID-19 deaths. DHHS says those deaths include people who have had a positive molecular or antigen test for COVID-19, who died without fully recovering from COVID-19, and who had no alternative cause of death identified. The deaths are reported by hospitals and clinicians directly to the local and state health departments. The first reported COVID-19 death did, indeed, occur on March 12. The states health department also tracks flu deaths and reports each flu seasons data on its website. Flu deaths are reported by health providers and were confirmed as influenza by an appropriate laboratory or rapid diagnostic test. PolitiFact reviewed the last 10 flu seasons, dating back to the 2010-2011 season. In total, we counted 1,486 reported flu deaths. DHHS spokeswoman Kelly Haight confirmed to us by phone that our total is accurate. Heres a list of the flu death counts by season, and a link to the report for each respective season: 2019-2020: 186 2018-2019: 203 2017-2018: 391 2016-2017: 218 2015-2016: 59 2014-2015: 218 2013-2014: 107 2012-2013: 59 2011-2012: 9 2010-2011: 36 The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention also tracks flu deaths by state. At a glance, it might seem like the CDC and North Carolina reports contradict one other. For instance, the CDC reported North Carolina had 2,064 flu deaths in 2018, while the states health department reported far less. Thats because the CDC sometimes combines flu and pneumonia deaths together, officials said. Under the flu & pneumonia section on the CDCs flu deaths by state website, most of those deaths are pneumonia deaths, said Jeff Lancashire, acting associate director for communications for the CDCs National Center for Health Statistics. Some pneumonia deaths are caused by the flu, but some can be caused by many other viruses, bacteria, bacteria-like organisms and fungi, said Kelly Haight, DHHS spokeswoman. The year 2018 is the most recent year of flu deaths available on the CDC site. If you start in 2018 and look back 10 years to 1999, Lancashire said there were 1,806 deaths from exclusively flu alone – without pneumonia (from the public database CDC WONDER – wonder.cdc.gov). So if Dr. Cohen was citing deaths from flu alone, she would be correct that COVID19 deaths have exceeded that (number) in NC, he said. The CDC has noted, however, that tallying death counts for COVID-19, flu and pneumonia is complicated and sometimes its data can be incomplete. Cohen said COVID-19 has killed more North Carolinians in a year than the flu has in the last 10 years. By the North Carolina health departments count, there have been 5,200 COVID-19 deaths this year and 1,486 flu deaths over the last decade. Cohens claim also tracks with data collected by the CDC, according to an agency spokesman. However, the CDC points out that exact numbers can be tricky to count because there are sometimes delays in processing death information.",1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,True

Final Rating: True  ",Says the state budget includes spending on commercials for Fortune 500 companies.,"State Rep. David Simpson says the state budget lawmakers sent to Gov. Rick Perry spends money in the wrong places — such as on Walmart commercials.Despite conservative boasts of cost cutting, not raising taxes and not using the Economic Stabilization Fund, or rainy day fund, the budget still preserves about $500 million of pork for special interests including film and music makers, video games and commercials for Fortune 500 companies, the Longview Republican said in a June 5 op-ed in the Longview News-Journal.Its well-reported that the state promotes music, film and even video games. But this is the first weve heard about funding TV spots for the top 500 U.S. companies that Fortune magazine ranks by revenue every year.To back up the statement, Simpson aide Michael Bullock noted that the 2012-13 budget the House approved on May 28 appropriates $32 million for film and music marketing, a program overseen by the governors office. The budget provides $16 million each year to market Texas as a film location and promote the Texas music industry, according to the May 26 House-Senate conference committee report.What does that have to do with Fortune 500 TV spots?Bullock pointed us to a March report by the Texas state comptroller analyzing the states economic development incentives for 2010. According to the report, lawmakers in 2007 revised the Film Industry Incentive Program, created in 2005, so its grants could be extended to companies working in the entire moving image industry, sweeping in makers of commercials, TV programs and video games.In 2009, the Legislature appropriated $64 million in incentives for the biennium.According to the report, from April 2009 through August 2010, the Texas Film Commission approved 152 applications to help fund the production of commercials, awarding $2 million to grantees who, all told, said theyd spend $37.4 million in Texas.And did any of the commercials promote Fortune 500 companies? The report lists a handful.As of Aug. 31, the company Action Figure No. 1. Inc., had received more than $8,000 for an AT&T television commercial, which was one of three commercials made for AT&T, a Fortune 500 company, by three different companies using state grants totaling about $25,600, the report says. Also, the company Radical Media received $32,000 in grant money to make a commercial for Walmart, another Fortune 500 company, and the company Modern Times received $11,133 to make a commercial for the TV show Friday Night Lights. That show aired on NBC, a network owned by the Fortune 500 company General Electric.We wondered if each Fortune 500 company benefits from grants going to separate production companies. Perry spokeswoman Lucy Nashed told us the grants can go to either the production company, advertising agency or the client — such as a Fortune 500 company — involved in a supported TV ad. Lastly, we turned to the Texas Film Commission, which says on its website that certain commercials — such as ads for state agencies or those that portray Texas negatively — arent eligible for incentives.Otherwise, state law permits incentives for a TV commercial project of up to 5 percent of the amount spent on the project in the state, according to the commission. To qualify, the maker must spend at least $100,000 in Texas, at least 60 percent of its shooting days must be completed in the state and at least 70 percent of the paid crew, cast and extras must be Texas residents.Nashed told us TV commercial projects will continue to be eligible for incentives in 2012-13.",1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,True

Kim Reynolds when Reynolds announced on Tuesday, May 11, that the statewill stop takingfederal funds for supplemental $300 payments to Iowans receiving unemployment benefits. The shift away from that COVID-19-related federal aid program, which means an end to the payment to out-of-work Iowans, is to take effect after June 12, 2021. The announcement came one day after an Iowa Workforce Development memorandum that said Iowa has a workforce shortage, which led Rep. Lindsey James (D-Dubuque) tostate on Twitter: There are more job openings than there are people on unemployment. Lets name the real problem here – Iowa needs higher wages. #ialegis More available jobs than people on unemployment to fill them? Yes, that is what theIowa Workforce Development report, from director Beth Townsend to Reynolds, states. Iowa had 60,900 unemployed workers in March for a 3.7 percent unemployment rate, that report stated, relying on U.S. Bureau of Labor Statisticsdata. More than 66,000 job openings showed up on the IowaWORKSwebsiteon May 10, Townsend wrote in the memorandum. Claims, continued and initial, continue to trend down, Townsends memorandum stated. Terminating the federal unemployment programs will not affect individuals eligible for regular state unemployment insurance claim benefits. Republicans, backed by business owners and trade groups,have arguedthat employers are having difficulty attracting workers in Iowa because of the jobless benefits money those prospective workers are receiving.The overwhelming message we receive from employers these days is the lack of workforce that is adversely affecting their ability to recover from the pandemic, Townsend said in a statement released by the governors office. Democrats, like James, counter that employers need to offer higher wages. Iowa had a labor shortage pre-COVID and it has continued now that we are recovering from COVID,James wrote in an email to PolitiFact Iowa.Moreover, she wrote,Iowa has more job openings that arent on the IowaWORKS website. Registered nursing jobs are most in demand in Iowa, the IowaWORKS website shows, but those jobs require special training and are an example of job requirements and pay disparity that exists. Other jobs, such as wait staff that Iowa restaurant owners toldThe Gazettenewspaper in Eastern Iowathey need, dont require the specialized college education a registered nursing job needs. Wait staff starting pay is around$8.45an hour, far less than the$23.84an hour entry pay for registered nurses in Iowa, state wage data show. After hearing about pandemic-related layoffs and job cuts the past year, seeing that more people are seeking jobs in Iowa than are taking unemployment benefits might surprise some. But the numbers back it up and both sides of the argument on what Iowa should do about unemployment benefits do not dispute it.

Final Rating: True  ",The potential Iran nuclear agreement would limit Iran to the number of centrifuges needed for a weapon but too few for a nuclear power program.,"The deadline for an agreement on Irans nuclear program is something of a moving target,but right nownegotiators need to wrap things up by June 2015. The five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council — China, France, Russia, the United Kingdom and the United States — along with Germany, have until then to strike a deal with the Islamic republic. If all goes the way the United States hopes, a signed agreement will keep Iran out of the nuclear weapons club. For now, the two sides are operating under an interim agreement, which rolls back Irans stock of enriched uranium and freezes the countrys capability to produce nuclear materials that could be used to make a nuclear bomb. In exchange, Iran can sell its oil more freely and gain access to millions of dollars in frozen assets. One element thats fully expected in a long-term arrangement is a limit on the number and kinds of centrifuges Iran can use to enrich uranium. Former CIA deputy director Michael Morell said theres an irony in that. If you are going to have a nuclear weapons program, 5,000 is pretty much the number you need, Morell, now a CBS analyst, said on Charlie Rose. If you have a power program, you need a lot more. By limiting them to a small number of centrifuges, we are limiting them to the number you need for a weapon. Morell told PunditFact he said 5,000 because that was lowest number he had heard was in play. The number of centrifuges in place today is a hair over 20,000, and a likely goal is to cut that to about 5,000. But Morells basic point struck us as just plain intriguing. We wanted to learn more about this idea that a nuclear power program would require many more centrifuges than youd need for a bomb -- which by extension means that limiting centrifuge capacity is just onenegotiating point out of many. The consensus among the experts we reached is that Morell is on the money. Matthew Kroenig at Georgetown University told PunditFact the Morell is is absolutely correct. Ditto for Daryl Kimball of the Arms Control Association and David Albright of the Institute for Science and International Security. Matthew Bunn at Harvard agreed with his colleagues.  People think surely you must need a bigger enrichment system to make 90 percent enriched material for bombs than to make 4-5 percent enriched material for power reactors, Bunn said. But exactly the opposite is true. Bunn said there are two reasons. First, you need tens of tons of material to fuel a power reactor for a year, but just tens of kilograms to make a bomb. According to the International Atomic Energy Agency, the threshold amount for a bomb is about 25 kilograms of the most highly enriched U-235. And while yes, its harder to make 90 percent enriched uranium (bomb) than 4-5 percent enriched uranium (power), its not that much harder, Bunn said. The toughest part in the process comes when you start with the raw uranium. By the time youve brought that to 4-5 percent, youve already done more than 2/3 of the work of going all the way to 90 percent U-235 for weapons, Bunn said. So the amount of work needed to make bomb material is only a modest amount more per kilogram, and the number of kilograms you need for bombs is 1,000 times less. Bottom line: Making bombs takes fewer centrifuges. And without a lot of centrifuges, its hard to make nuclear power. For the record, some centrifuge modelsare better than others, so that's also a factor. Today, Iran has just one nuclear power station, the plant at Bushehr that it bought from the Russians. To keep that facility running, Iran would need to increase its centrifuge capacity ten-fold. A steady supply of fuel from Russia is what keeps Bushehr online. Centrifuges and a nuclear deal This fact that bombs require fewer centrifuges than power is a source of frustration for Albright, a physicist with the Institute for Science and International Security. I wish it were reversed, he told us. Then we could easily tell if the program was for weapons. As the clock clicks down to reach an agreement, the number of centrifuges and their level of sophistication will draw a lot of scrutiny. Kimball, of the Arms Control Association, said the specific terms on this front will have to resolve a crucial question: What are Irans practical needs, and how do you square that with international concern about the real purpose? Ideally, Kimball said, Russia or another nation would continue to supply the fuel, but barring that, the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council and Germany aim to put on cap on the number of centrifuges for as many years as possible. Allowing about 5,000 would help. With that, it would take 12 months for Iran to produce enough material for one bomb, Kimball said. That would give you enough time to detect that activity. But Bunn underscored that an agreement would have many moving parts and a key element would be the number of years that Iran agreed to rein in its centrifuge capacity. Because the sides have already agreed in the (interim agreement) that after the agreement expires, Iran is to be treated like other parties to the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. That would mean it could build up its enrichment capacity to have enough to fuel Bushehr or even more reactors, Bunn said. The variables dont stop there. If Iran ramped up production of fuel for nuclear power, it would need a ready supply of raw ore, which it might need to purchase on the international market. During his interview with Charlie Rose, Morell warned that the focus on declared centrifuges is misplaced, because he expects that if Iran were to try to build a bomb, it would do so in secret. The only protection against that, Morell said, is unannounced inspections at any place in the country at any time. Our ruling Morell said that it takes fewer centrifuges to make bomb-grade nuclear material than it does to supply fuel for a nuclear power plant and argued that the focus on centrifuges can go too far. That argument aside, experts agreed that Morrell has his facts right. A power plant requires tons of fuel each year. A bomb requires about 25 kilograms of U-235 enriched to the 90 percent level. If an agreement limits Iran to about 9,000 centrifuges, that would be sufficient to produce enough bomb-grade material but would leave Iran well short of the capacity to generate fuel to power nuclear power plants.",1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,True

Final Rating: True  ","Under Mayor Tom Barrett, the number of Milwaukee police officers has not increased.","Milwaukee Ald. Bob Donovan, a candidate for mayor in 2016, worries that upcoming retirements could further reduce what he sees as an undersized police force under Mayor Tom Barrett. In his state of the city speech Feb. 24, 2014, Barrett noted he had added 120 new officers in his 2014 budget. Donovan hit on that number when interviewed in the wake of his mayoral announcement. The reality is the number of officers has not increased, Donovan said during a July 29, 2014 appearance on the Charlie Sykes show on WTMJ-AM. Now the mayor will continue to say were hiring 120 cops this year. That doesnt take into consideration the fact that weve had 150 retirements, or that we havent filled positions going way back. When we asked Donovan about the comment, he did not cite hard numbers, but told us he figures unfilled positions and retirements have outstripped the addition of recruits over the 10 years Barrett has been in office. Is Donovan right? Has police strength -- at least by the numbers -- been flat or gone down on Barretts watch? To answer that question, we turned to the citys Fire and Police Commission, which issues an annual report that details the size of the overall force. To be sure, the actual number of bodies on the force on any given date is constantly changing, since retirement dates vary while recruit classes mean a wave of new bodies joins the force at once. The Fire and Police Commission reports, available online, are as close to an official tally of police strength as we found. They list, by race and gender, the number of persons on the Police Department payroll as of the last pay period of each year. The latest covers 2012, so we obtained figures for 2013 and so far in 2014 directly from the commission. We used 2004 as the pre-Barrett baseline for our comparisons, because Barrett didnt take office until spring 2004 and therefore did not propose the budget for that year. All figures factor in retirements, terminations and new hires. Police officers At the end of 2004, 1,402 police officers were on the payroll. That number fell to 1,357 by the end of 2013, a 3 percent drop. By that measure -- the one the public sees -- Donovan is correct that officer strength has not increased. Barrett administration officials note it can be misleading to look only at strength of force at any one point in time. A new class of officer recruits came on line in late 2004, boosting the number, they said. A comparison of pay period one in 2004 to the same period in 2014, for example, actually shows a small increase in officer strength. A better measure than point in time comparisons, they said, is average strength across the whole year. That was 1,349 in 2004, they said, and based on the first half of 2014 its 1,341 now -- a smaller decline. Still, that approach does not change the accuracy of Donovans claim. Total sworn officers City officials often will refer to this larger figure when discussing officer strength, and Donovan did as well when we contacted him. It includes not only patrol officers but detectives, supervisors, various technicians and specialists as well as the police chief and the top command staff. At the end of 2004, the figures show 2,006 sworn officers were on board. That number fell to 1,828 by late 2013 and to 1,875 by mid-July 2014. Earlier in 2004, according to Barretts budget staff, the figure was 1,932. And Barretts office released figures using the average strength throughout the year that show a smaller drop in overall sworn strength. Again, those figures change the angle of descent, but not the downward direction of the trend. Within those numbers, the detective ranks fell by more than one fourth. So by this broader measure, Donovan is on target again. Ten-year trend The staff strength figures from the Fire and Police Commission show that the police officer ranks grew early in Barretts tenure, but have slipped gradually with one exception since then.  Year 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 P.O.s* 1,402 1,362 1,390 1,441 1,406 1,392 1,362 1,348 1,384 1,357 1,345** As for the broader sworn ranks, a similar trend is evident. By way of explaining the lack of growth in the police force, Barrett chief of staff Patrick Curley and city budget officials said state shared-revenue aid to Milwaukee has dropped by $25 million since 2004 while the police budget is $65 million higher. They said the department under Chief Edward Flynn has re-deployed officers from administrative tasks to community policing. That was accomplished by hiring more civilians to do those desk jobs, they said. Efficiencies have helped avoid layoffs seen in some big cities, Barrett spokeswoman Jodie Tabak said. The Barrett officials told PolitiFact Wisconsin that our inquiry for this fact check led the mayor to quickly unveil a proposal to add 15 more officers to a training class that will graduate in April 2015. It already had been under consideration to announce later this year, they said. The mayor will propose his 2015 budget in September. Our rating Donovan said the number of Milwaukee police officers has not increased under Mayor Tom Barrett. Donovans claim is on target because reports from the citys Fire and Police Commission indicate a decline in the number of officers since 2004. And other measuring sticks offered by Barretts office show the same trend.",1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,True

Final Rating: True  ","The status quo led the General Assembly to reduce pension payments four straight years starting in 2005, costing billions of dollars as the delay in contributions essentially borrowed from pension funds at a very high interest rate.","Illinois Gov. Bruce Rauner has been pushing for changes to the states pension funds since he first began running for governor in 2013. His proposed FY 2016 budget suggested moving all state employees into a pension plan with lower benefits. He moved away from that approach once the Illinois Supreme Court declared unconstitutional a law that sought changes to pension benefits. He hasnt, however, stopped blaming the Illinois General Assembly, with its Democratic majorities, for contributing to the states mushrooming pension debt. As he launched an extended media crusade this year, Rauner said legislators who approved pension contribution breaks from 2005 to 2009 cost state workers and taxpayers billions. The status quo led the General Assembly to reduce pension payments four straight years starting in 2005, Rauner wrote in Springfields Capitol newspaper, costing billions of dollars as the delay in contributions essentially borrowed from pension funds at a very high interest rate. For several years now, Illinois has had the dubious distinction of having the worst pension debt in the nation. Illinois current debt was listed at $129.8 billion in November by the state General Assemblys bipartisan Commission on Government Forecasting and Accountability.  We decided to dig in to Rauners claim that reducing payments cost billions and was like borrowing at high interest rate. Borrowed time A 2013 settlement Illinois officials made with the federal Securities and Exchange Commission confirms the reduced pension payments for the four years in question, said Laurie Cohen, senior analyst with the Institute for Illinois Fiscal Sustainability at the Civic Federation, a nonpartisan government finance research group. The SEC said that despite state claims that pension holidays would be offset by increased fund contributions from 2008 to 2010, a 2005 amendment allowed lawmakers to skip increasing contributions to make up for the pension contribution holidays. The SEC settlement document underscores Rauners claim that the delay in contributions exacerbated the state pension funds condition. Although the State disclosed the basic fact of these reduced contributions, it reads, the State did not disclose that each of these deviations exacerbated the Structural Underfunding, deferred contributions further into the future, impaired the ability of the State to meet its pension obligations, and negatively impacted the States creditworthiness. Daniel Hertz, a senior policy analyst with the progressive Center for Tax and Budget Accountability, agreed Rauners claim was supported by the facts. In an email, Hertz said, The legislation Rauner referenced did have the effect of reducing pension contributions below what they otherwise would have been for four years, and that additional underfunding was, essentially, borrowing that increased costs down the line. According to a 2006 COGFA report, Hertz said, the net effect of the law was to increase pension payments from the State by $6.8 billion between FY2006 and FY2045. Our ruling In an opinion piece published by a Springfield newspaper, Republican Gov. Bruce Rauner said lawmakers in the Illinois General Assembly authorized reduced pension payments from 2005-2009. He said those lowered contributions cost billions and were akin to borrowing from the funds at a high interest rate. The General Assemblys own finance agency and a federal settlement with the SEC confirms four years of reduced contributions. The SEC said the move aggravated the funds condition and ability to meet its obligations and worsened its creditworthiness. A 2006 report said the underfunding required $6.8 billion more in payments.",1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,True

Hillary Clinton during the April 16 Democratic debate ruled out meeting with Iran's President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. As she criticized the Bush administration for failing to deter Iran from pursuing its nuclear program, Clinton said Ahmadinejad's most recent inflammatory remarks would make it impossible for her to speak with him directly. I certainly would not meet with Ahmadinejad because even again today he made light of 9/11, and said that he's not even sure it happened and that people actually died, Clinton said. Ahmadinejad, who has a history of provocative statements on such things, including saying the Holocaust was a fake, did indeed, question the U.S. version of the events of 9/11 on three occasions in just over a week. He said U.S. claims about being attacked were a pretext for military action against Iraq and Afghanistan. Four or five years ago a suspect event took place in New York, Ahmadinejad said in an April 16 speech in the holy city of Qom that was broadcast live on state television, according to Agence France Presse. A building collapsed and they said that 3,000 people had been killed, whose names were never published. Under this pretext they (the United States) attacked Afghanistan and Iraq and since then a million people have been killed. Ahmadinejad first expressed his doubts about the attacks on April 8 at a ceremony in the holy city of Qom celebrating Iran's nuclear program, which U.S. officials worry could be used to make weapons. He questioned how aircraft could have evaded radar and intelligence and crashed into the twin towers undetected. Ahmadinejad repeated his doubts the next day at a speech at a Shiite holy shrine in the city of Mashhad, according to press accounts. Iran condemned the attacks soon after they occurred. The government at the time was headed by moderate President Mohammad Khatami. Ahmadeinejad has been given to bellicose pronouncement in the past and provoked a global outcry when he described the Holocaust as a myth. During his controversial visit to the United States in September 2007, Ahmadinejad, when asked about the death penalty Iran imposed on homosexuals, denied there were homosexuals in Iran. He has repeatedly called for Israel's destruction. On Wednesday, he reaffirmed his intention to change the international order, Agence France Presse reported. We have two missions, Ahmadinejad proclaimed. To construct Iran and change the global situation. It is impossible to reach the summits of progress without changing the corrupt and unjust order of the world. Tehran insists its nuclear program is peaceful and intended to expand energy supplies for a growing population. The statement may be startling, but it's true. Clinton accurately summarized Ahmadeinejad's recent comments about 9/11. We judge her statement to be True. ",1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,True

Final Rating: True  ",Says Mitt Romney suggested that employers should be able to make the decision as to whether or not a woman gets contraception through her insurance coverage.,"President Barack Obama and Republican candidate Mitt Romney clashed over contraceptives coverage in their second debate, with Romney ultimately declaring, the president's statement of my policy is completely and totally wrong.That sounded like a request for some fact-checking.So, was Obama totally wrong?The issue emerged in the Oct. 16, 2012, debate at Hofstra University after a question from the audience about how the candidates intended to fix income inequality for women.Obama touted signing the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, then said: Romney later responded: It's worth noting that they were talking past each other. Obama was referring to whether an employer should dictate whether employees insurance covers contraceptives. Romney sidestepped the issue about insurance coverage and said he opposes a different concept — whether employers can tell someone whether they can have contraceptive care.For this fact-check, were asking whether Romney has suggested that employers should be able to make the decision as to whether or not a woman gets contraception through her insurance coverage.The Blunt amendmentObamas support for his claim centers on something called the Blunt amendment.Early this year, congressional Republicans made a big push to roll back a provision by Health and Human Services under Obamas health care law that requires most employers to provide birth control coverage without any out-of-pocket costs, with a limited exception for certain religious institutions.In the Senate, Sen. Roy Blunt, R-Mo., sponsored an amendment that would exempt employers from providing any service that went against their beliefs or moral convictions. At the time, the issue put the Obama administration on the defensive and the president himself appeared at the White House briefing room to explain a work-around for religious affiliated hospitals, universities and the like.A few weeks later, with a vote on the Blunt amendment pending, Romney was asked where he stood. He told a Boston radio interviewer Of course I support the Blunt amendment.CNSnews.com, a conservative news service, put the question directly to the Romney campaign.Will Mitt Romney, on day one, rescind this mandate in its entirety — as the Catholic Church has urged the current administration to do — so that individuals, employers and insurers who have a moral or religious objection to contraception or sterilization will not be forced to violate the tenets of their own faith or act against their consciences?Romney campaign spokesman Ryan Williams responded: Yes. Gov. Romney would rescind the mandate in its entirety.In April, Romney reiterated his opposition to the rule at a meeting of the National Rifle Association. He said, As president, I will abolish it.So the Obama campaign argues if Romney supports an employers ability to decline to provide a service that goes against beliefs or moral convictions, that means he supports employers making the decision as to whether or not a woman gets contraception through her insurance coverage.Romneys responseWe asked the Romney campaign to explain his objection to Obamas claim. Here's a statement from spokeswoman Andrea Saul: The statement acknowledges that Romney opposes a nationwide mandate for contraception coverage. In the absence of a federal mandate, that would sometimes leave the decision to employers whether to offer coverage for birth control.(Before Obamacare, some 27 states already required such coverage, though were not sure how many had religious exceptions.)Our rulingObama said Romney suggested that employers should be able to make the decision as to whether or not a woman gets contraception through her insurance coverage.Romney says he doesnt believe bureaucrats or employers should make the call whether a woman can use contraceptives. But his support for the Blunt amendment endorses the approach that employers should be able to make the decision about whether contraception is covered by employees insurance.",1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,True

Final Rating: True  ",Says Central Texas river water sent to downstream rice farmers in 2011 equaled about three years worth of Austins water use.,"Austin-area residents worried about drought might rue an agencys 2011 decision to let thousands of gallons of water from the Highland Lakes flow past the capital to downstream farmers, the head of the Austin Water Utility said. A May 27, 2014, news story said: Massive releases of water to rice farmers downstream that greatly reduced lake levels in 2011, the single driest year in Central Texas history, didnt help either. The story--by StateImpact Texas, a collaboration of KUT Austin and KUHF Houston--then quoted Greg Meszaros, the utilitys director, as saying: Comparison-wise, about three years worth of Austins water use was sent to rice farmers that year. That much? Asked the basis of Meszaros comparison, utility spokesman Daryl Slusher referred to annual reports on water use from the Lower Colorado River Authority, which oversees water releases from the chain of man-made lakes along the Colorado River running through Austin: Buchanan, Inks, LBJ, Marble Falls, Travis and Austin. By email, Slusher said the reports show that in 2011, the latest year the authority sent water downstream to rice farmers, the provided water was three times the amount of water used by Austin in 2011, 2012 or 2013. According to the authoritys March 30, 2012, report on water use in 2011, the authority that year released 529,580 acre-feet in water for downstream agricultural purposes, including rice farming. That broke down to 433,251 acre-feet let go from the Highland Lakes plus 96,329 acre-feet of water used by farmers from the river alone, the report says. An acre-foot, 325,851 gallons, is roughly equal to the water used by three average Austin households in a year. And the 529,580 acre-feet of water that went to farmers compares to Austin using 168,334 acre-feet of water that year, the report states, including 61,712 acre-feet diverted from the Colorado River at Lake Austin and 106,622 acre-feet obtained from the Highland Lakes under a city contract with the authority. This result suggests the water released to farmers was equal to a little more than three times what Austin used that year. Also, Slusher pointed out that according to the authority, Austin used less water in 2012 (151,495 acre-feet) and even less again (142,027 acre-feet) in 2013, widening the 3-to-1 ratio for those years. Another way to suss Meszaros claim, Slusher wrote, lies in adding up the last three years worth of Austins water use, which gets us 461,856 acre-feet, or 13 percent less than the 529,580 acre-feet released to farmers in 2011. Our ruling Meszaros said billions of gallons of river water released to downstream rice farmers in 2011 equaled about three years worth of Austins water use. Equaled or exceeded is the long and short of it. TRUE – The statement is accurate and theres nothing significant missing.

Final Rating: True","Rep. Paul Ryan's budget proposal cuts nothing from Medicare, Social Security or defense in the next two to three years, and in three years, he does not cut one dime from the debt.","President Ronald Reagan's former budget director, David Stockman, has taken on a new public role calling out both Democrats and Republicans for failing to address budget deficits quickly, using spending cuts and tax increases.Democrats need to accept cuts to entitlement programs like Social Security and Medicare, Stockman wrote in a recent New York Times op-ed, while Republicans should accept tax increases, not only for the rich, but also for the middle class. Stockman appeared on the roundtable This Week with Christiane Amanpour on May 1 to make similar arguments.Prior to the roundtable, Amanpour interviewed Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wisc. As the chair of the House Budget Committee, he created a broad budget proposal that the U.S. House of Representatives approved, mostly along party lines, on April 15. It's unlikely the proposal will become law; Senate Democrats and President Barack Obama oppose the plan.Stockman didn't have kind words for Ryan's outline.I think both parties are delusional in thinking that this is a long-run problem. The Ryan plan gets the balanced budget in 2030, the fiscal hereafter. We have a here-and-now problem, Stockman said. Now, what does Ryan do in the next two or three years? Nothing. He cuts $600 (billion) or $700 billion of spending, mostly from a small part of the budget, discretionary and the safety net, leaves Medicare totally untouched for three years, leaves Social Security totally untouched for 10 years, leaves defense totally untouched for the next three years, and then, after cutting that small amount, gives it all back by extending all the Bush tax cuts that we can't afford. ... In three years, he does not cut one dime from the debt. Ryan's budget proposal accepts cuts already proposed by Secretary of Defense Robert Gates but doesn't suggest additional reductions. Ryan's budget proposal uses the same numbers for defense spending as the White House's proposed 2012 budget, though Obama has since suggested additional cuts to defense. The reductions amount to $78 billion over the next five years, a small number considering defense got approximately $720 billion in 2011 alone. Ryan's budget slows the future growth of defense spending, but he doesn't actually reduce it.Ryan's proposal says explicitly that the first job of government is national defense and rejects deep, across-the-board cuts in funding for national defense. (On this point, Ryan's proposal has attracted critics both for proposing too much and too little. A commentator with the libertarian Cato Institute says defense should be cut more, while one from the conservative Heritage Foundation says the spending isn't enough to achieve U.S. security goals.)We checked the proposal's numbers with Todd Harrison, an expert on the defense budget at the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments, a research institute that focuses on defense. Even with Gates' suggested reduction, the Department of Defense budget would not actually go down -- it would essentially stay flat (only growing with inflation) for the next 12 years, Harrison said via e-mail.In three years, Ryan does not cut one dime from the debt.As Stockman noted in his comments, Ryan's proposal does cut some discretionary spending in the short term. But it's not enough to make a dent in the public debt. Keep in mind what the debt is: It's the total of all the money we've borrowed. The deficit, on the other hand, is the yearly shortfall. So making the deficit smaller each year doesn't cut the debt. As long as annual deficits exist, the debt will grow every year.Ryan's proposal reduces deficits but it does not eliminate them until 2040, 29 years from now, according to the CBO analysis. The Path to Prosperity document includes projections for the public debt between 2011 and 2021, and it shows debt going up every single year. Congress is now debating an increase in the debt limit from its current level of $14.3 trillion; Ryan's budget shows the debt increasing to $16.2 trillion in 2012 and rising every year after that up to $23.1 trillion in 2021.So Stockman's right on this one, too. True.Other viewpointsWe checked with Ryan's office for a response to Stockman's complaints. A spokesperson describes Ryan's plan as common sense gradual reforms, and pointed out that it reduces deficits compared with current policy and compared with President Obama's budget.Economic growth, combined with a real solution to rising health care costs, is the key to putting our budget on a path to balance and our economy on a path to prosperity. Tax increases kill growth, and simply cutting benefits for current seniors is not a real solution to rising health care costs, said spokesperson Conor Sweeney via e-mail.Meanwhile, we should point out that liberal critics who dislike Ryan's plan would also disagree with Stockman's critique. Short-term spending should not be reined in because it would hurt the economic recovery, they've said.Here's how New York Times columnist Paul Krugman put it recently: Why not slash deficits immediately? Because tax increases and cuts in government spending would depress economies further, worsening unemployment. And cutting spending in a deeply depressed economy is largely self-defeating even in purely fiscal terms: any savings achieved at the front end are partly offset by lower revenue, as the economy shrinks.Our rulingWhether the deficit should be reduced quickly or slowly is no doubt a debate that will continue to burn. Stockman urges a dramatic approach to cutting spending and increasing taxes quickly, while Ryan's proposal offers a more gradual approach to cutting spending, and it doesn't advocate raising taxes. Stockman said Ryan's plan leaves Medicare totally untouched for three years, leaves Social Security totally untouched for 10 years, leaves defense totally untouched for the next three years, and then, after cutting that small amount, gives it all back by extending all the Bush tax cuts that we can't afford. ...

Final Rating: True  ","Wisconsins 2019-21 budget produced the first positive general fund balance since 2000, and the governors proposed 2021-23 budget would return it to a deficit.","Wisconsins state government is diving into another battle over how its budget will look for the upcoming two-year period. In February, Gov. Tony Evers, a Democrat, proposed a $91 billion spending plan for 2021-23, seeking to expand Medicaid, roll back Act 10-era collective bargaining limits, legalize marijuana and raise the minimum wage -- among scores of other items intended to put the state back on its feet after the coronavirus pandemic. On May 6, 2021, the Republican-controlled Joint Finance Committee stripped nearly 400 items from Evers budget, with the co-chairs saying it included a tremendous amount of excessive spending, pet projects, tax increases and divisive non-fiscal policy. Democrats say Evers budget would fix long-standing problems in the state and honor measures that are widely popular with voters. But Republicans say their plan would keep Wisconsinites from facing a higher tax burden. Theyve also argued that the governors budget would send the states general fund back into a deficit based on a common accounting standard, after its 2019-21 budget created the first positive balance by that standard that the general fund had seen since 2000. Staff of Sen. Howard Marklein, R-Spring Green, created a chart showing as much that several members of the Republican caucus have shared on social media. Is the claim correct? Lets dig in. The chart cited depicts Wisconsins general fund deficit dating back to 2000, at which time the deficit totaled around $1 billion based on Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, or GAAP. The line peaks in fiscal year 2010-11, when the general fund deficit was nearly $3 billion, by this measure. In 2020, the chart shows a negative deficit — or rather, a positive general fund balance. An arrow then indicates that Evers proposed 2021-23 budget would return the general fund to a deficit. Gov. Evers budget is a bounce back to larger GAAP deficits, Sen. Duey Stroebel, R-Saukville, tweeted along with the chart on April 7, 2021. Adam Gibbs, communications director for the office of Senate Majority Leader Devin LeMahieu, R-Oostburg, provided an analysis from the nonpartisan Legislative Fiscal Bureau that bears some of the claim out. The analysis, which Marklein requested in December 2019, indeed shows the states general fund had been in deficit since 2000, with the largest — $2.99 billion — during fiscal year 2010-11. It ends with fiscal year 2017-18, at a $1.25 billion deficit. The general fund deficit for the following year is detailed in Wisconsins Comprehensive Annual Financial Report. In 2019, it was just under $800 million in deficit. In 2020, the tide turned and the general fund reached $1.5 million under those standard accounting principles, according to the Comprehensive Annual Financial Report for the fiscal year ending June 30. At the time, Evers credited his government for working on issues important to Wisconsinites without running up the states credit card. It was the first time Wisconsin had reached a positive GAAP fund balance since the state began issuing the comprehensive annual financial reports, he said. Evers 2021-23 budget in brief, released in February 2021, outlines a return to the general fund deficit over the next two years. In 2021, the estimated closing GAAP fund balance is still positive, at about $921 million. In 2022, its estimated at a deficit of nearly $2 million. In 2023, the estimated deficit is about $938 million. This deficit doesnt mean the states budget isnt balanced — in fact, Wisconsin is required by law to pass a balanced budget where estimated revenues are at least equal to estimated expenditures. The GAAP system, however, counts future expenditures at the time that the state commits to spending on them, even if they wont be paid until the next budget cycle. The states other method of accounting, called cash modified accrual, doesnt count expenditures until it comes time to pay them. Members of the states Republican caucus claim that Evers proposed budget would return the state to a GAAP fund deficit, after its first positive balance in the fund in decades in the biennium prior. The Legislative Fiscal Bureau analysis shows the funds deficit through fiscal year 2018, and the states annual financial report shows it turning around in 2020. In the Department of Administrations estimation of the next two years, the deficit would return in 2022 and persist through 2023.  ",1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,True

Final Rating: True  ","Contends that President Obama literally said (if) his cap-and-trade proposals were to pass, that utility rates, his words now, would, 'necessarily skyrocket.'","With Congress debating a cap-and-trade plan to reduce global warming, House Republicans are touting an alternative that they say will be less expensive.Instead of regulating carbon dioxide by forcing power companies to buy and trade polluting credits, why not subsidize renewable fuel production and build new nuclear reactors, posited GOP Congressman Mike Pence on MSNBC's  Morning Joe  on June 10, 2009. Otherwise, he said, power companies will pass the cost of buying those credits on to the consumer, driving up the price of energy.Pence wanted to make clear that he was not taking credit for that economic prediction.I don't think you need to look any further than the president himself ... who literally said [if] his cap-and-trade proposals were to pass, that utility rates, his words now, would, 'necessarily skyrocket,' said Pence. He added that Democrat John Dingle of Michigan and the Commerce Committee said people don't realize this is a tax, and a 'great big one.'It didn't take us long to find Barack Obama's original quote, which came from a videotaped interview he did with the  San Francisco Chronicle  editorial board very early in the presidential campaign, January 2008.Under my plan of a cap-and-trade system, electricity rates would necessarily skyrocket, Obama told the  Chronicle  . Coal-powered plants, you know, natural gas, you name it, whatever the plants were, whatever the industry was, they would have to retrofit their operations. That will cost money. They will pass that money on to consumers.While Obama was talking specifically about cap-and-trade, he was also making a larger point that the biggest challenge will be making sure voters understand why such a plan is necessary.The problem is can you get the American people to say this is really important, Obama said.So, Pence is right. Obama did say that cap-and-trade would be costly to power plants and to consumers.What's fuzzy, however, is  how  costly. PolitiFact has already  looked into the issue  and found that estimates vary. Republicans say each household will pay $3,100 a year, a figure they came up with based upon a Massachusetts Institute of Technology study that predicted a cap-and-trade proposal would generate $366 billion annually. On March 24, 2009, we gave the claim a Pants on Fire ruling because the GOP's calculation was badly flawed and because the GOP used the figure even though the author of the MIT study had told them it was wrong. And in an April 1 letter to House Republicans, authors of the MIT study said that the report was being misinterpreted; by their count, estimates hover closer to $340 per family.Congress has its own estimate: A 15 percent cut in carbon emissions would cost the average household about $1,600, according to a March 12, 2009, Congressional Budget Office testimony.It is worth noting that the climate debate has changed substantially since Obama sat down with the  Chronicle  nearly a year and a half ago. Legislators have opted to give 85 percent of the polluting permits away for free instead of putting them up for sale, as Obama pledged to do on the campaign trail. In theory, this approach should reduce costs to consumers. Furthermore, revenue from auctioned permits will help consumers pay for increased energy prices, according to Obama's first budget.Despite those potential cost cuts, there's still little disagreement that consumers will pay for cap-and-trade, whether it's $3,100 a year or $340. Because that hasn't changed since Obama first said that utility rates would necessarily skyrocket, and because Pence got Obama's words just right, we give Pence a True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/6ffafdf4-5637-4e52-8ff3-7d5f0ecab7f6",1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,True

Final Rating: True  ","Financial conflict-of-interest laws don't apply to the president, right? So, the president doesn't have to have a blind trust.","How President-elect Donald Trump will handle his extensive businesses and financial holdings — and the potential conflict of interest that comes with them — when he gets into the Oval Office remains an open question. Trump has said his children will manage his business dealings. Many presidents in the past have put their assets in a blind trust, which is when an independent trustee manages another persons assets without the persons input. But Trump doesnt actually have to do any of this because the financial conflict-of-interest laws dont apply to him as president, said former New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, who is reportedly on the short list for a seat on Trumps cabinet. Well, first of all, you realize that those laws don't apply to the president, right? Giuliani told CNNs Jake Tapper Nov. 13. So, the president doesn't have to have a blind trust. For some reason, when the law was written, the president was exempt. Giuliani has the law pretty much right. Trump, as president, has no legal obligation to detach himself from his businesses and financial interests. The law at issue is Title 18 Section 208 of the U.S. code. It says federal executive branch employees cant participate in government matters in which they or their immediate family has a financial interest. Because of this law, some federal employees put their investments in a blind trust. This allows them to sidestep the regulation and participate in a matter that might otherwise pose a conflict of interest. But the president and the vice president, despite being executive branch employees, are exempt. According to the laws definitions, Title 18 Section 208 does not apply to them, nor does it apply to members of Congress or federal judges. It appears that presidents have mostly escaped the normal web of ethics and conflict-of-interest laws, said Scott Amey, general counsel at the Project on Government Oversight, a nonpartisan government accountability watchdog. Amey added that presidents are allowed to accept gifts in many cases, too. Its been this way since at least 1974, when the Justice Department issued a letter saying Title 18 Section 208 did not apply to the president. Congress expressly codified the exemptions in 1989. In the 1974 letter, the Justice Department said the legislative history of this conflict-of-interest provision indicated that it was never intended to apply to the president. Additionally, the Justice Department said placing conflict-of-interest laws on the president could constrain him in a potentially unconstitutional manner, though it did not give specific examples. As the head of the executive branch, the president may not be able to — and arguably under the Constitution it might not be possible to require the president to — recuse from government decisions, said Richard Briffault, a professor of legislation at Columbia Law School. While Title 18 Section 208 is the primary conflict-of-interest provision, there are other relevant rules, including a couple that dont exempt the president. Trump and Vice President Mike Pence will have to disclose their finances, which is required of all high-level federal employees, Briffault said. But the disclosures are not as detailed as federal tax returns, which Trump has not released. Then theres the Constitutions Emoluments Clause, which bans U.S. government employees from accepting presents or compensation from foreign governments, noted Kathleen Clark, an expert on legal ethics and a law professor at Washington University in St. Louis. The Trump Organization has numerous foreign ties, including several overseas real estate deals with possible foreign government connections. In 2012, for example, Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan attended a ribbon cutting ceremony for Trump Towers Mall in Istanbul. If any of Trumps business arrangements involve the receipt of payments from foreign governments, I believe that he, or his entities from which he receives money, would have to forgo those payments, or he would have to detach from those entities, Clark said. But it's not fully clear that presidents arebound by the Emoluments Clause, and no court has weighed into answer this question. The way the clause is constructred — that itdoesn't specify the president,unlike other provisions inthe Constitution, for example— and the fact that President George Washington himself took gifts from the French government without asking Congress for permission, together make a good case that it doesn't apply to presidents,said Seth Barrett Tillman, a professor at Maynooth University in Ireland who has studied the clause. Our ruling Giuliani said financial conflict-of-interest laws don't apply to the president, right? So, the president doesn't have to have a blind trust. The president is, in fact, exempt from the primary conflict-of-interest provision in the U.S. code. So presidents do not have any legal obligation to put their financial holdings in a blind trust or to detach themselves from their financial interests in any way. As president, Trump will have to comply with financial disclosure requirements, however, and it's possible he is constrained by a clause in the Constitution regarding income from foreign governments.

Final Rating: True  ","We, the bishops of the United States -- can you believe it -- in 1919 came out for more affordable, more comprehensive, more universal health care.","The Catholic church and the White House have been clashing over contraception requirements in President Barack Obamas signature health care law. As weve noted before, the Affordable Care Act requires Catholic hospitals to provide all birth control approved by the Food and Drug Administration to their employers with no out-of-pocket costs, including birth control pills, Plan B, diaphragms and hormone shots. Coverage for emergency contraception, but not abortion, is required. Religious employers are exempt from the requirement, but the hospitals dont qualify for exemptions because they both employ and serve people who may not share their religious beliefs. In an interview with David Gregory on NBCs Meet the Press, Cardinal Timothy Dolan of New York, perhaps the most prominent member of the Catholic heirarchy in the United States, spoke out against a mandate for hospitals to provide these services, including emergency-contraception pills. At the same time, though, Dolan cited some common ground between the church and the administration its been battling. We bishops have been really kind of in a tough place because we're for universal, comprehensive, life-affirming health care, Dolan said. We, the bishops of the United States -- can you believe it -- in 1919 came out for more affordable, more comprehensive, more universal health care. That's how far back we go in this battle, okay? We wondered whether the bishops support for comprehensive health care really goes back nearly a century. Experts pointed us to the history of the National Catholic Welfare Council, the predecessor of the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops. The council held an annual meeting in which U.S. bishops discussed national policy issues such as education, welfare and health care. During the February 1919, meeting, held just after World War I, a group of bishops, led by a Catholic social reformer, Father John A. Ryan, published the Bishops Program of Social Reconstruction, a guide to overhauling U.S. social justice. Dolan was referring to a section on social insurance, his spokesman said. The state, the guide read, should make comprehensive provision for insurance against illness, invalidity, unemployment, and old age. That wasnt the last time the USCCB has supported health care expansions. For example, the group has publicly supported a variety of proposals, including former President Bill Clintons ultimately defeated health care plan in 1993. The flap is over the (contraception) issue, said Maria Mazzenga, a Catholic history archivist at The Catholic University of America. Thats where it comes to appear that theyre against universal health care. Mazzenga said that, despite opposition to one specific part of Obamacare, all but the most conservative bishops have consistently supported health care efforts over the years. Our ruling Dolan said U.S. bishops have supported expanding health care since 1919. Hes correct that the National Catholic Welfare Council published pro-health-care expansion literature that year, and experts told us that the bishops have regularly supported proposals to expand health care over the years, despite disagreements over specific provisions enacted under Obama, including contraception regulations.",1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.5,1.0,1.0,True

Final Rating: True  ",The National Park Service has an annual budget that is less than the city of Austin.,"From the mountains to the valleys and to the oceans, the U.S. government spends less money running parks than Austin devotes to city government, a federal honcho told Congress. Jonathan Jarvis, director of the National Park Service, prefaced his June 14, 2016, mention of Austin with some agency self-celebration, telling the U.S. House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform: The NPS manages many of our nations most iconic and beloved landscapes and historic sites. We are responsible for managing more than 400 individual parks with more than 84 million acres of land, stretching from Acadia National Park in the State of Maine to the National Park of American Samoa in the South Pacific. The NPS also manages numerous wild and scenic rivers and national trails; programs that recognize our nations historic structures; and programs that help local governments and organizations provide recreational opportunities and protect open space. We are seeing record-breaking visitation -- more than 300 million last year -- and the resulting economic activity created by the parks topped $16 billion. We are accomplishing all of this, Jarvis said next, on an annual budget that is less than the city of Austin, Texas. Right off, Jarvis seemed right on the numbers. For the fiscal year that began Oct. 1, 2015, the park services budget amounts to $3.4 billion, which folds in $2.85 billion appropriated by Congress plus expected fee revenue, a park service spokesman, Jeff Olson, advised by email. The service has 22,000 employees, he said. Olson, asked how Jarvis came to single out Austin, said that in preparing for the House hearing, Jarvis was looking for another government entity's budget with which to compare the NPS. Jarvis settled on Austin for his comparison after looking online for the budgets of various cities, Olson said. For the same fiscal year, the Austin City Council approved a $3.5 billion budget, according to the published city budget. A city spokesman, David Green, conceded the numerical differences though he indicated that comparing the total budgets obscures vast differences between the federal agency and Austin city government. While it is accurate to say Austins $3.5 billion budget is larger than that of the National Park Service, Green said by email, it is difficult to make a direct comparison. The City of Austin has over 13,000 employees spread across more than 40 departments – including our own Water and Electric utilities – that provide daily direct service to more than 900,000 residents. The scope and mission of the city is simply too varied to make an apples-to-apples comparison, Green said. Olson, reacting to Greens analysis, said by email: It may be difficult to compare Austin to the NPS. While the city serves 900,000 residents, the NPS serves more than 300 million visitors each year, many of them from Austin, no doubt. A federal wrinkle? We asked a pro-parks group, the National Parks Conservation Association, about Jarvis claim. By email, spokeswoman Kati Schmidt said association experts pegged the services fiscal 2016 budget at $3.377 billion after adding appropriated funds plus fees and other mandatory funding. But Schmidt also illuminated additional money coming to the park service for federal road projects. Park service roads also benefit from Highway Trust Fund dollars for maintenance totaling $268 million this year, Schmidt wrote. That $268 million would drive up the agencys total expected 2016 spending to $3.645 billion by our calculation--which would exceed Austin city governments $3.5 billion budget. But hold on: We ran this thought past the park services Olson who said by phone its fair to say the additional roads money is being spent by the agency. Yet Olson said by email the $268 million is part of the U.S. Department of Transportation budget. The associations Schmidt further told us the park services resources/facilities also benefit at times from a variety of other random smaller sources like state grants and private donations (both monetary and in-kind), but we dont have any sum total of all funding sources that benefit the system. These other sources are not technically part of the NPS budget so in terms of Jarvis reference to an annual budget, indeed the claim appears to be defensible, Schmidt said. Citing insufficient knowledge about the citys budget, Schmidt declined to speculate about whether the director made a fair apples-to-apples comparison. Some differences beyond budget totals Its worth noting the park service and Austins city government draw on divergent revenue sources. Congress, which spends tax revenue, appropriated 84 percent of the park services budget. In contrast, just 24 percent of the citys 2015-16 budget, or $818 million, was penciled in to come from tax revenue. On the other hand, the city budget shows $1.9 billion in revenue from utility charges, largely meaning income from the sale of electricity, water and wastewater services; that chunk of money covers 54 percent of the city budget. Notably, too, the city has a capital improvements budget supported by debt, grants and fund transfers. In 2015-16, the Austin City Council appropriated $629.6 million for such projects; that amount is not part of the $3.5 billion total budget, city spokeswoman Alicia Dean told us by phone. So, the city plans to spend more than $4 billion in fiscal 2016, counting the regular and capital improvements budgets. Olson told us the park services 2016 budget folds in more than $192 million budgeted by the agency for comparable construction and repair/rehabilitation purposes. Put another way, he said, that money is part of the $3.4 billion total budget. Our ruling Jarvis said the National Park Service has an annual budget that is less than the budget for the city of Austin. For the fiscal year through September 2016, this is so by $100 million--though there are arguably plenty of differences between the agency and Austin city government that keep this comparison from meaning a great deal.

Final Rating: True",Says the media distortedwhat happened with a baby at his rally.,"Donald Trump is crying foul at news reports alleging he kicked a crying baby out of a Virginia rally last week. The media is going crazy. They totally distort so many things on purpose. Crimea, nuclear, the baby and so much more. Very dishonest! he tweeted. We looked into his widelyreported comments on Crimea and a host of other issues. But is it true that babygate isnt based on reality? Trumps charge of media distortion sticks. The scandal started at an Aug. 2 Trump rally in Ashburn, Va. As he was talking about trade, a baby began to cry in the audience, prompting the famously off-the-cuff Trump to chime in. I love babies. I hear that baby cry, I like it, he said. What a baby. What a beautiful baby. Don't worry, don't worry. The mom's running around, like, don't worry about it, you know. It's young and beautiful and healthy, and that's what we want. As the baby continued to cry, Trump continued to comment. Actually I was only kidding, you can get the baby out of here, he said. I think she really believed me that I love having a baby crying while I'm speaking. That's okay. People don't understand. That's okay. These sentences caught fire in the press. Heres a smattering of headlines from a variety of media outlets: • New York Daily News: SEE IT: Donald Trump kicks crying baby out of rally • Rolling Stone: Watch Donald Trump Throw Crying Baby Out of Rally • New York Times: Donald Trump Jousts With a Crying Baby at His Rally • Fox News: Trump has infant removed from rally for making noise • Salon:  You can get that baby out of here: Donald Trump, upstaged by crying baby, orders it removed from rally • Wired: Trump didnt just banish a baby. He banished a mother • Baltimore Sun: Trump banished the baby, humiliated the mother But, as our friends at the Washington Post Fact Checker reported, Trump didnt actually kick the baby out of his rally.  Toronto Star reporter Daniel Dale cleared things up that day, writing that Trumps get the baby out of here comment came as the mother was already exiting. A joke? Possibly. An insensitive, heartless, ordinary-person-embarrassing remark? Possibly. Trumps tone is eternally hard to read, Dale wrote. But, to my eyes, it certainly was not an ejection — it was an unusually barbed endorsement of the mothers own decision to depart. NBC reporter Katy Tur was also at the event and said comment was very clearly a joke and the baby stayed. Tur reported about the incident on Bloombergs With All Due Respect (around the 30 minute mark). Another guest on the program, the Washington Posts Phil Rucker, agreed: I was there, too. It was a joke. It was definitely a joke. The Associated Press reported that after saying you can get that baby out of here, Trump then seemed to suggest that he was joking and the baby could stay. The child soon stopped crying. Devan Ebert, the mother herself, said as much in widely circulated Facebook posts soon after the news reports began appearing. Ebert confirmed to PolitiFact that this statement came from her: I excused myself and my child when he awoke from his nap and began to cry. It was only because I had to grab my child's belongings and then make my way out of the aisle I was seated in that I wasn't out of there sooner. ... I fully support Mr. Trump. I thought he responded very graciously to my child crying and he made a lighthearted moment out of what I usually consider to be stressful. I actually was out of the auditorium before he even made his follow up comment about my child and even then, when I was informed of his comment. I laughed. I understand he says things jokingly, and I understand no one wants to speak over or struggle to listen over a crying baby. I am in no way offended and I again reiterate, Mr. Trump NEVER kicked me or my child out of the Briar Woods High School, Trump rally. Ebert reiterated this in an interview, telling us she was never kicked out of the rally and Trump still has her vote. I appreciate that Mr. Trump made light of an otherwise stressful situation, she said. At the time of this report, none of the publications listed above have issued corrections or updated their stories. Our ruling Trump said the media distortedwhat happened with a baby at his rally. Many media outlets reported that Trump threw out or ejected a crying baby from a campaign event in Virginia, based on his commentary on the incident. But this isnt true. Trumps comments came as the mother was already voluntarily exiting from the rally. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/598870c7-2bbd-47a5-8d22-04f0a67ebc97",1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,True

Final Rating: True","Today, for the first time in fifteen years, Master Locks unionized plant in Milwaukee is running at full capacity.","President Barack Obama hailed the return of manufacturing jobs that had been shipped overseas during his State of the Union speech on Jan. 24, 2012. The president discussed companies that have brought back production after labor problems in China, economic issues and higher shipping rates added to costs.Obama said: We cant bring every job back thats left our shore. But right now, its getting more expensive to do business in places like China. Meanwhile, America is more productive.He added: A few weeks ago, the CEO of Master Lock told me that it now makes business sense for him to bring jobs back home. Today, for the first time in 15 years, Master Locks unionized plant in Milwaukee is running at full capacity.Master Lock hasnt had this much publicity since it ran those Tough Under Fire Super Bowl ads showing their product surviving a sharpshooters bullet. Those ads ran for 20 years, starting in the mid-1970s.So whats the latest at the companys huge central city plant?The lock maker, a division of Fortune Brands Home & Security, Inc., was founded in Milwaukee in 1921.Fifteen years ago, Master Lock had about 1,154 workers at its Milwaukee plant, 2600 N. 32nd Street, a sprawling facility thats been described as the size of seven football fields. That year, Master Lock announced that it would begin importing locks from China, a move that began a string of large job reductions in Milwaukee.Two years later, the company announced that it would open a lock assembly factory in Nogales, Mexico. Because of the outsourcing and competition from those cheaper locks made elsewhere, employment in the Milwaukee plant fell to about 270 employees in 2003, the company said.The cost advantages of overseas production began to decline in the late 2000s. By the end of 2010, the company said, several dozen jobs were moved back to Milwaukee. Employment grew to 379, news reports said.In early 2011, company executives used the full capacity description of production in a Journal Sentinel story about the return of the outsourced jobs. That message returned at a White House meeting in January 2012, and again in the State of the Union address.The White House meeting was a in-sourcing forum. At that event, the president singled out Master Lock for praise.The company says employment in Milwaukee is now 412. Master Lock still operates factories in China and Mexico.So what does it mean when the company and Obama say that the plant is operating at full capacity? After all, there are nearly 750 fewer people working there than 15 years ago.Without providing specifics or revenue figures, Master Lock said in a written statement that the Milwaukee plant is a far different operation than it was in 1997.The Milwaukee plant is producing parts and components at a much higher volume than in 1997, reflecting our regained market share and Master Lock's overall revenue growth, which is approximately double 1997 revenues, the company said. Moreover, Milwaukee-made production is now being sold directly to Master Lock customers in China, reflecting its new competitiveness. Master Lock said it decided to re-size and convert Milwaukee into a more automated and highly efficient manufacturer of parts and components regardless of final assembly destination.Such lean manufacturing efforts have paid off for many companies, said Nick Hayes, a partner with FiveTwelve Group Ltd., a business research and consulting firm in Milwaukee.Manufacturers can become far more efficient by using automation, high-tech equipment and streamlining the way they move supplies and inventory around a factory, he said.Hayes offered an example of a factory he worked with that adopted lean manufacturing. The company downsized from a 60,000 square foot factory and 100 workers to one that was two-thirds smaller, with half the work force. Production increased 10-fold.The question I would have for Master Lock is how primitive were they before? Hayes said.Consumer demand for the product is another critical factor, he said. And Master Lock indicated that sales had increased.Without providing specifics, Master Lock said it hoped to continue to add jobs in Milwaukee.We plan to invest in the plant this year to add capacity as we in-source more work. We are also investing in training and working with area technical colleges and universities to find and equip skilled workers.Our conclusionObama singled out Master Lock saying the company brought back outsourced jobs and is operating at capacity for the first time in 15 years. Thats the same thing Master Lock executives said more than a year ago, and theyve continued to add jobs and said they would continue to do so. It also tracks with their efforts to attract a more highly skilled work force to run an updated operation.",1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,True

Final Rating: True  ",The number of inmates since 2000 on death row dying of natural causes has now surpassed the number of inmates executed.,"House Speaker Dean Cannon thinks the Florida court system overstepped its authority last year when it removed three Constitutional amendment questions from the statewide ballot. So, in 2011, he's talking about comprehensive court reform.Addressing a group of nearly 50 reporters and editors at the annual pre-session meeting organized by the Associated Press, Cannon again made his case that the court system should not have removed constitutional amendments that, if approved by voters, would have granted tax breaks for first-time home buyers and affected state redistricting. A third amendment was drafted in response to the new federal health care law to prohibit Florida from participating in any health insurance exchange that compels people to buy insurance.All three amendments were stripped from the ballot after judges ruled that the attached ballot language was either flawed or misleading.Cannon said he will propose legislative changes to effectively remove or diminish judicial review of ballot questions.But that's not all.Florida's judicial system has the authority to take away not only a person's liberty, but also a person's life. Understanding the severity and irreversible nature of that penalty, we have a responsibility to ensure that justice is administered not only fairly, but also efficiently, Cannon said. Criminal cases are complex in nature and in recent years we've seen cases overturned, and there have been errors. The number of inmates since 2000 on death row dying of natural causes has now surpassed the number of inmates executed. Significant and unreasonable delays plague the current process of conducting state post-conviction review in these cases and it appears that there is little the Supreme Court can do to improve or streamline the process.Cannon said that is where the Legislature can step in.I believe the Legislature can and should work with the judicial branch to significantly improve the administration of justice in death penalty cases, he said. I am hopeful that reform could lead to a more equitable judicial system for all Floridians, and as we move forward toward the 2011 legislative session, we will continue to explore this issue to determine when and what the right course of action for Florida may be.Cannon hasn't specified what court reform legislation might look like, though by his comments it sure sounds like he wants the appeals process in death row cases hastened. In that vein, we decided to check his facts about Florida's death row, focusing on this claim: The number of inmates since 2000 on death row dying of natural causes has now surpassed the number of inmates executed.Of the 392 people now on Florida's death row,House records indicate that145 inmateshave been there for 20 years or longer and 34have been there for 30 years or more, according to Cannon spokeswoman Katie Betta.Gary Alvord has been on Florida's death row since April 1974, according to the Florida Department of Corrections. Alvord escaped a Michigan mental hospital and wound up in Tampa, where he killed three women. Alvord, who turned 64 on Jan. 10, 2011, has been on death row for more than 13,400 days. This April, he will have been awaiting execution for37 years.John Vining, who was sentenced to death in 1990, is the oldest person on death row. On March 13, 2011, he will turn 80.Vining wasconvicted of shooting and killing a woman who was trying to sell him a $60,000 diamond.Since Florida reinstated the death penalty in 1976 (and began carrying out sentences in 1979), 69 people have been executed -- a rate of a little over two per year. One reason, for starters,is a lengthy and costly appeals process. But politics plays a role as well. The governor must sign a death warrant for an execution to proceed.And sometimesother complicating factors are cited.Alvord, for instance, has a long history of mental illness and has been declared mentally incompetent by several courts.The last person to be executed in Florida was Martin Grossman in February 2010. Grossman was convicted of shooting a Pinellas County wildlife officer who happened upon Grossman shooting a stolen handgun in a wooded area.Gov. Charlie Crist signed the death warrant of David Eugene Johnston in 2010 as well, but Johnston died while awaiting his sentence. He was convicted of stabbing an 84-year-old Orlando woman to death in 1983.That transitions naturally to Cannon's claim.The Florida Department of Corrections provided PolitiFact Florida with a list of 55 inmates who died on death row starting Jan. 1, 2000. Thirty of the 55 somehow died while awaiting their sentence (the state does not describe the nature of a person's death), and 25 were executed.For example, Eddie Lee Sexton Sr. died on Dec. 29, 2010, while living on death row. Sexton was convicted of murder after a jury found that he ordered his mentally impaired son to strangle Sexton's son-in-law at a Florida park. Sexton feared that the son-in-law was going to report family abuses to local authorities, prosecutors said. Sexton was sentenced to death in 1998.Robert Power died on Dec. 3, 2010, while awaiting sentence for the rape and murder of a 12-year-old Orange County girl. Power had been on death row for 20 years. The waiting and appeals process certainly comes with additional cost. The Death Penalty Information Center, a Washington policy group that does not advocate for or against the death penalty, published a 2009 report discussing the cost of enforcing the death penalty. The group cited a 2000 Palm Beach Post analysis, which said that the state spends $51 million a year enforcing the death penalty. That's $51 million a year more than it would cost to punish all first-degree murderers with life in prison instead. The figure has been repeated by several other news publications as well as Rex Dimmig, chief assistant public defender of the 10th Judicial Circuit, in testimony before a state Senate committee discussing the death penalty.Make no mistake, the death penalty is a controversial and complex policy issue. But here, we're focusing on Cannon's call for reforms based on death row inmate data. He said: The number of inmates since 2000 on death row dying of natural causes has now surpassed the number of inmates executed. He's right. Of the 55 death row inmates to die since Jan. 1, 2000, only 25 actually were executed.",1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,True

Final Rating: True  ",Sherrod Brown has voted with Barack Obama 95 percent of the time.,"Republicans in Washington, D.C., and Ohio have vast ideological differences with U.S. Sen. Sherrod Brown, an Ohio Democrat.Brown says the government plays a positive role in peoples lives when it provides a safety net (new health insurance programs, financial regulation, help for cash-strapped cities and schools) while supporting the private sector. Republicans say the government needs to step back to propel the economic engine that is the private sector.While lofty, that makes for a poor sound bite. But the GOP knows this, and is prepared to frame its November election effort against Brown like this: When you look at his voting record, what's going to stick with voters is that he has voted with Barack Obama 95 percent of the time. He can talk about differences some of the time, but you've got to look at the record.That quote comes from Christopher Maloney, communications director for the Ohio Republican Party. Maloney made the claim to The Plain Dealer during a telephone interview in December 2011, and again with a slight variation on Jan. 22, 2012, that well discuss in a moment. It is that variation that we're checking here.The interview was for a story, published Jan. 23, on how Republicans plan to campaign against Brown in the coming political season. While the newspaper checked out the figure and had reason to believe it was accurate, it also believed -- for purposes of PolitiFact Ohio -- that the figure deserved further examination, and a ruling on the Truth-O-Meter. After all, voters are likely to hear the claim a lot this year.Maloney said his figure came from Congressional Quarterly, a nonpartisan journalism organization that reports on Capitol Hill lawmaking dispassionately. CQ, as it is known, serves as a bit of a bible for journalists, congressional offices and even lobbyists, because it goes into the weeds of legislating like few other publications do. Its reporting winds up in CQ Today, CQ Weekly, CQ online products, and an annual hard-bound political almanac, Politics in America.Besides covering hearings and more, CQ examines voting patterns for every member of Congress and sorts them in ways that allow comparisons. One of those ways is through an annual examination of presidential support, or the number and percentage of votes by each lawmaker on bills in which the sitting president has staked a position.So, for example, CQ counted a vote for the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, better known as the economic stimulus bill, as a vote in support of the president. The same principle applied to the health care reform vote of 2010, to votes on taxes, the debt ceiling, and so on. Presidents weigh in on fewer than half of all Senate votes (Obama had a position on 39 percent of the Senates 235 votes last year), and some bills have broad bipartisan support no matter who is in the White House.No lawmaker winds up with a presidential support score of zero -- not even such small-government fans as Republicans Jim DeMint of South Carolina or Rand Paul of Kentucky. But the closer to zero, or to 100, a score is, the higher the lawmakers opposition or support for the presidents agenda.Back to the figure Maloney cited: He stated from the start that his source was CQ. He originally said the figure for Brown was 97 percent -- that is, that Brown has voted with President Obama 97 percent of the time. That was based on an average of CQ ratings, for 2009 (Obamas first year, when Brown scored 96 percent) and 2010 (98 percent). Maloney was accurate when he made the statement because CQ Weekly had not yet published its ratings for 2011.That changed, just before The Plain Dealer was about to publish its story. A new issue of CQ Weekly came out, with new numbers covering 2011. And the positions of Brown and Obama, it turns out, diverged slightly more often in 2011 than in the previous two years.Browns presidential support rating dropped to 92 percent in 2011 -- matching, it turns out, the 92 percent support rate that other Democratic senators had on average for the president last year. In contrast, Browns Ohio colleague, Republican freshman Rob Portman, voted with the president 59.5 percent of the time in 2011 -- which while not as high as the 71.90 percent rate of Maine Republican Susan Collins, still put Portman in the top tier, at 13th, of Republicans voting most often for Obamas positions. DeMint and Paul, by contrast, each had presidential support ratings of 41 percent in 2011.When averaged for the three years of Obamas presidency so far, then, Browns support fell from 97 percent to 95 percent. (Do the math: 96 plus 98 plus 92, divided by 3, equals 95.3.) Maloney, when told by The Plain Dealer that CQ had had just put out brand new figures, updated his statement to reflect that 95 percent rate.We report this without judgment on whether it is good or bad to support the Obama agenda. Brown has disagreed with Obama on foreign trade and on some greenhouse gas-regulation issues. But Maloney says that youve got to look at the record.And the record -- compiled not by an opposition party but by a publication regarded as eminently impartial -- provides an average of 95 percent. The figure is current. On the Truth-O-Meter, Maloneys claim merits a rating of True.",1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,True

Final Rating: True  ","There is nothing in the current state public records law that prohibits sensitive or confidential business information from being just that, confidential.","New Gov. John Kasich has made it clear his top priority while in office is to bring jobs to Ohio and turn the economy around.JobsOhio, a publicly funded, private nonprofit corporation, is Kasichs big idea to attract businesses here and create jobs. The nonprofit corporation will act as a privatized version of the Department of Developments economic development efforts. Yet the transition of this public agency, which Kasich has described as sluggish and ineffective, to the private sector has raised concerns about transparency and accountability.Kasich, a Republican, wants JobsOhio to be exempt from Ohios public records and open meetings laws. The corporation would be audited annually to show the public its spending. But Democrats have loudly criticized the exemptions, saying they would keep the corporations operations under wraps and out of the public view, inviting scandal and a misuse of taxpayers dollars. Kasich and other Republicans say the exemptions are needed to help JobsOhio move at the speed of business. Public disclosure could disrupt business negotiations, they argue.State Rep. Matt Lundy, a Democrat from Elyria, is not convinced JobsOhio needs to be shielded from public records laws, and he has introduced legislation to subject the corporation to those rules.There is nothing in the current state public records law that prohibits sensitive or confidential business information from being just that, confidential, Lundy said in a Feb. 7 news release announcing his legislation, which he called the Taxpayers Right to Know Act.Republicans control the Ohio House of Representatives, so Lundys bill is unlikely to get much attention. But since his effort highlights ongoing concerns about JobsOhio, PolitiFact Ohio decided to check out Lundys claim and examine how Ohios public records laws treat the states interactions with outside businesses.Ohios public records law, section 149.43 of Ohio Revised Code, establishes the public availability of records kept by public offices, whether its a city hall or local school district or the governor. The law also includes numerous exceptions, which range from a police officers home address to adoption records.These exceptions also apply to certain business records.Sensitive business records often fall within the trade secrets exception to Ohios public records law, said David Marburger, an attorney for Baker Hostetler in Cleveland and counsel for the Ohio Coalition for Open Government. Marburger, who often represents The Plain Dealer on issues of public access to government, called the trade secrets exception extremely broad.Ohio Revised Code section 1333.61 defines a trade secret as any information, including business information, financial information, technical information, formulas, names addresses and telephone numbers, of actual or potential economic value.Marburger said the trade secret exception is a nearly impenetrable shield when a government entity and a business share sensitive or confidential information.Kent State University School of Journalism and Mass Communication professor Tim Smith agreed. He also cited the trade secrets exception when asked about Lundys statement. From my knowledge about the open records law, Lundys statement is accurate, said Smith, a former managing editor for the Akron Beacon Journal.Kasichs administration and Republicans in the House of Representatives, which already has approved the JobsOhio plan, have offered a cross-section of scenarios in which public disclosure would impede JobsOhios mission. (The Republican-controlled Ohio Senate is still reviewing the plan.) For example, if communication between JobsOhio and a sought-after company was public record, another states could use that information to trump Ohios offer.PolitiFact Ohio is not rating whether JobsOhio should be exempted from public records laws. Regardless of the advantages or disadvantages, Lundys statement that Ohios public records law includes exceptions that protect sensitive and confidential business information is correct.On the Truth-O-Meter it earns a rating of True.",1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,True

Final Rating: True  ",There are countries in Africa where they have higher vaccination rates than here in the United States.,"Sunday show talking heads continued to debate vaccinations of children -- specifically, how there should be no debate -- as they analyzed political missteps from the past week. BBC World News America anchor Katherine Katty Kay made a startling comparison to highlight how Americans have been less diligent in making sure their children are properly immunized. There are countries in Africa where they have higher vaccination rates than here in the United States, Kay said on NBCs Meet the Press. Because when people really need it,and they see the effects that measles can have on their communities, they will make sure that their children vaccinate. Rhetoric about the measles outbreak stemming from Disneyland in California, home to a significant measles-resistant population, is keeping PunditFactand PolitiFactbusy. We wanted to continue our look at this re-emerging viral threat by examining the accuracy of Kays claim. While we did not hear back from her by our deadline, we have a pretty good idea of Kays source. The World Health Organization, which recommends infants be vaccinated with at least one dose of the MMR vaccine before their first birthday, maintains immunization rates for the measles vaccine among 1-year-olds by country. The most recent data is for 2013. There were 16 African countries that beat the U.S. rate of 91 percentfor the measles-mumps-rubella vaccinein 2013, according to the WHO data. (TheCenters for Disease Control and Prevention putsthe measles immunization rate in the United States is91.9 percent.But the WHO and CDC measure the statistic in different ways, and as you'll see, it doesn't make a difference.) The countries besting the United States are Algeria, Botswana, Burundi, Egypt, Eritrea, Gambia, Kenya, Lesotho, Libya, Mauritius, Morocco, Rwanda, Seychelles, Tanzania, Tunisia and Zimbabwe. United States  91 percent * Algeria 95 percent Botswana 94 percent Burundi 98 percent Egypt 96 percent Eritrea 96 percent Gambia 96 percent Kenya 93 percent Lesotho 92 percent Libya 98 percent Mauritius 99 percent Morocco 99 percent Rwanda 97 percent Seychelles 97 percent Tanzania 99 percent Tunisia 94 percent Zimbabwe 93 percent  Of course, many African countries facing steep impoverished conditions have lower and substantially lower rates, such as Central African Republic (25 percent), Chad (59 percent), Equatorial Guinea (42 percent), Ethiopia (62 percent), Nigeria (59 percent), South Sudan (30 percent) and South Africa (66 percent). More broadly, its not just African countries beating the United States. Latin American countries with rates about the same as or exceeding the United States include El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras and Mexico. South Africa-based think tank Good Governance Africa spurred news about the United States trailing some African countries in a Feb. 5 press release highlighting the WHO data. Researcher Kate van Niekerk hailed the improved availability and widespread usage of the vaccine as a major public health success that has reduced child deaths even though the disease continues to kill about 400 children every day. Still, Dr. Cathy Troisi, infectious disease epidemiologist at the University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston School of Public Health, said the nearly universal use of the measles vaccine in some parts of Africa is the result of a large international effort to reduce child mortality. Reducing by two-thirds the under-five mortality rate between 1990 and 2015 was one target of the United Nations millenium goals. Unlike in some regions of Africa, where measles remains a leading cause of child death, some American parents are strangers to scary, eradicated diseases that afflicted prior generations, she said. Americans also generally value individual rights over community needs, she added. Im old enough that I was born before the polio vaccine became available, Troisi said, and you can bet when it came out, my mom was first in line to get me vaccinated. Part of the reason were seeing this refusal is because parents havent seen what these diseases can do. Because we were curious, we wondered how the U.S. vaccination rate stacked up against its more populous companions. The U.S. population is about 319 million, making it the third-most populated country. China, with 1.36 billion people, is at 99 percent. India, with 1.24 billion people, has a rate of 74 percent. Indonesia, at 253 million residents, had a rate of 84 percent. Brazil and its population of more than 200 million residents had a measles vaccination rate of 99 percent. Our ruling Kay said, There are countries in Africa where they have higher vaccination rates than here in the United States. We found ample evidence to back up her point, with several African countries boasting better vaccination rates than the United States. Mauritius, Tanzania and Morocco have nearly complete vaccination of 1-year-olds, according to World Health Organization data.",1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,True

Final Rating: True",Over 50% of the people now in the House and state Senate have not been born in Virginia.,"U.S. Rep. Denver Riggleman, R-5th, recently accused the newly-elected Democratic majority in the General Assembly of embracing liberal policies that are out of sync with Virginia. Democrats last fall won control of both legislative chambers for the first time this century. Riggleman, during a Jan. 23 radio interview on the John Fredericks Show, said the party has gone absolutely loco in passing gun control bills, proposing a gas tax hike to improve roads and backing measures he said will hurt small businesses. He said Democrats could be facing the shortest tenure ever for a majority, based on the craziness coming out of the state legislature. He added, Over 50% of the people now in the House and the state Senate have not been born in Virginia. And most of them, completely new. Theyre not even Virginians by grace yet. We fact-checked Rigglemans statistic. Well leave it to you to determine what, if anything, qualifies a person to be a Virginian by grace. The numbers To learn where lawmakers were born, we consulted their biographies on the House and Senate websites and in General Assembly manuals. In a few cases, we turned to newspaper stories or asked legislative aides. The newly-elected House of Delegates sworn in last month has 52 members born outside Virginia and 48 born inside the state. The newly-elected Senate has 22 members born outside the state and 18 born within. Combining the chambers, 74 legislators were born outside Virginia, 66 inside. Thats a flip from 2019, when Republicans held narrow majorities in both chambers. In the House 52 delegates were born in Virginia, 48 werent. In the Senate, 22 were born in Virginia, 18 were not. Combing the chambers, 74 lawmakers were born inside Virginia, 66 outside. In other words, there was a net addition in both chambers of four members born outside the state. But these numbers are tricky and dont suggest - as Riggleman implies - that those born outside Virginia are alien to its culture. Nine current General Assembly members (six senators and three delegates) listed as being born out of state were delivered across the Potomac River in Washington D.C. Their biographies show six of them (four senators and two delegates) graduated from high school or college in Virginia. If counted, Rigglemans claim about out-of-state majorities would fall. Twelve other legislators were born in states bordering Virginia: North Carolina; Maryland; West Virginia; Kentucky; and Tennessee. Republican Del. Terry Kilgore, for example, has lived in Gate City in Southwest Virginia for all of his life, except when he attended college and law school in other parts of Virginia. But he was born in a hospital 20 miles away in Kingsport, Tenn. and - in Rigglemans claim - doesnt count as a native-born Virginian. Demographics So far, weve been focusing on the details of numbers between 2019 and 2020 and, by strict count, there has been a transition to where a majority of General Assembly members were born out of Virginia. But a broader trend emerges if we use 1960 as our starting point. The increase in non-Virginia legislators over the past 60 years reflects the increase in non-native-born Virginians living in the state. In 1960, Virginia was in the final years of domination by a political machine controlled by Democratic U.S. Sen. Harry Byrd that was rural in origin and segregationist. The House of Delegates had 96 Democrats and four Republicans; the Senate had 38 Democrats and two Republicans. Eighty-five percent of the legislators were born in Virginia, as was 71% of the states population. These days, Virginias politics are dominated by a suburban crescent arching from Northern Virginia through Hampton Roads. Theres been a large migration to the state through these suburbs - particularly Northern Virginia - by a professional class of government workers and contractors. The U.S. Census Bureau estimated that 50.5% of the states population in 2018 was born outside Virginia. That nearly matches the 52% of legislators this year who were not born in Virginia. People like to vote for people who reflect them, said Larry Sabato, a University of Virginia political scientist. These legislators reflect the people they represent. Rigglemans living in the past. Weve become a different state, said Bob Holsworth, a political scientist and consultant. I certainly understand some people who regret that some of the traditions have gone by, but in terms of overall prospects (offered by Virginia), theres a big difference between now and 65 years ago. By the way Although its not part of fact-check rating, we took a quick look at Rigglemans contention that most of the out-of-state legislators were elected last year. Hes wrong. Only nine of the 52 non-Virginia born delegates were elected last fall, as were only five of the 22 senators born out of state. Our ruling Riggleman says, Over 50% of the people now in the House and state Senate have not been born in Virginia. Fifty-two delegates in the 100-member House were born outside of Virginia; so were 22 members of the 40-seat Senate. We have trouble with Rigglemans implication that those born outside Virginia are out of step with the state. Many born outside the state grew up and were educated in Virginia. Moreover, the 52% percent of lawmakers born in other places nearly matches the 50.5% of Virginia citizens born elsewhere. ",1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,True

Final Rating: True","If you look at the number of illegal immigrants coming into the country, it is net zero. It's been that way now for almost two years.","As millions watch them during their national convention in Tampa, Republicans are trying to appear tough on illegal immigration without offending Hispanic voters.Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, who is bilingual and met his wife in Mexico, has warned his fellow Republicans they need to watch their tone on the immigration issue. He repeated that warning in an interview on Meet the Press the weekend before the convention.My personal view is that we need to get beyond where we are, Bush said. We need to create a climate of border control. And thats begun to happen, if you look at the number of illegal immigrants coming into the country, its net zero. Its been that way now for almost two years. And if you say, well, weve gotten a much better grasp on the number of people just coming in without papers, then you could develop a strategy thats part of economic growth. For this fact-check, we will research whether Bush was correct when he said the number of illegal immigrants coming into the country is net zero, and that its been that way for two years.Pew Hispanic Center studiesWe turned to the Pew Hispanic Center for an answer. The center is a nonpartisan research organization that does not take positions on policy issues.Its 2012 report about Mexican immigration concluded, After four decades that brought 12 million current immigrants -- most of whom came illegally -- the net migration flow from Mexico to the United States has stopped and may have reversed. The report was based on the centers analysis of federal census data.We interviewed Jeffrey Passel, a senior demographer at Pew and an expert on Hispanic immigration. He said that Bushs claim is true. Passel said that we can infer that the outflow of unauthorized immigrants exceeded inflows between 2007 and 2009 because the overall size of the unauthorized population living in the U.S. decreased between 2007 and 2009 from 12 million to 11.1 million.There are four ways the number of unauthorized immigrants changes: the inflow of new unauthorized immigrants, the outflow of those leaving the U.S., deaths and unauthorized immigrants gaining legal status.Those last three categories -- outflow out of the U.S., deaths and conversion to legal status -- exceeded the first category of new inflows of unauthorized immigrants by about 900,000 between 2007 and 2009. But deaths and conversion to legal status are not large figures. Therefore, Passel said, the major source of the decline is almost certainly an excess of outflow of unauthorized over inflow.You can read about Pews reports about net migration from Mexico here and in general about trends in the illegal immigration population here and here.We also sent Bushs claim to groups with opposing views on immigration and all agreed that Bushs statement was correct.I think you will find everybody agrees with it being zero or close to it, said Roy Beck, executive director of Numbers USA, which advocates for low immigration.A spokeswoman for The National Immigration Forum, which advocates for immigrants, sent us a New York Times op-ed piece co-written by two professors, one a former foreign minister of Mexico and the other co-director of the Mexican Migration Project at Princeton. That op-ed piece also stated that the rate of undocumented immigration is nearing zero. Our rulingBush said If you look at the number of illegal immigrants coming into the country, it is net zero. It's been that way now for almost two years.It is difficult to get a precise figure on the population of illegal immigrants. But data from Pew Hispanic Center, a widely respected source referred to by those of different political viewpoints on immigration, supports Bushs claim.",1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,True

Final Rating: True  ",2008 was the deadliest year of the war (in Afghanistan) for American forces.,"Long since eclipsed by Iraq, the Afghan conflict, known to the military as Operation Enduring Freedom, has often been relegated to the back pages of the newspaper. Even as it has faded from view, however, the war has grown ever deadlier, President Barack Obama said in a speech to government officials and military officers at the White House on March 27, 2009. It's been more than seven years since the Taliban was removed from power, yet war rages on, and insurgents control parts of Afghanistan and Pakistan, Obama said, announcing the deployment of 17,000 more troops to Afghanistan. Attacks against our troops, our NATO allies, and the Afghan government have risen steadily. And most painfully, 2008 was the deadliest year of the war for American forces. We wondered if that was true and checked the latestPentagon statistics. Indeed, U.S. military deaths numbered 155 in 2008, which is the highest since the war began in 2001. The number of U.S. deaths has increased almost every year, with two exceptions. The year-to-year fatality count, from 2001 to 2008, is: 11, 48, 45, 52, 98, 98, 117, 155. In the first two months of 2009, there were 30 U.S. military deaths, putting this year on pace to be the deadliest yet. We looked for any indication that this statistic was unrepresentative of the conditions in Afghanistan. Quite the contrary — it is one of several measures by which the situation in Afghanistan has deteriorated. The number of U.S. military personnel wounded in action has also increased every year, from 33 in 2001 to 790 in 2008, totaling 2,713. Military deaths of personnel from the 21 other outside countries involved in the conflict have increased every year since 2004, to a peak so far of 139 in 2008 (and 2009 is on pace to surpass that). Afghan civilian casualties hit a high mark too last year, with 2,118 civilians killed, up from 1,523 in 2007, according to the United Nations. In testimony to the House Armed Services Committee in September, Adm. Mike Mullen, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said Taliban and al-Qaida fighters are coordinating better from safe havens in Pakistan and launching ever more sophisticated, even infantry-like attacks against fixed coalition positions. I'm not convinced we're winning it in Afghanistan, Mullen said. Defense Secretary Robert Gates told the committee Afghanistan was in some ways a more complex challenge than Iraq. We don't have a single adversary, he said. We have the Taliban, we have the Gulbuddin Hekmatyar group, we have the Haqqani network, we have narco-thugs, we have al-Qaida, we have foreign fighters. So Obama's claim is not only technically correct, but also accurately reflects the deteriorating security conditions in Afghanistan.

Final Rating: Mostly False  ","Says Joe Biden told Americans, If you elect me, your taxes are going to be raised, not cut.","A new ad from a pro-Trump super PAC uses out-of-context footage of Joe Biden to claim that the former vice president wants to raise taxes for Americans across the board. Versions of the ad from America First Action began airing Aug. 4 on Facebook and on TV screens in Wisconsin and North Carolina. They focus largely on a comment Biden made in response to a voter during a February campaign stop in South Carolina. But the America First Action ad presents that remark out of context. And while some tax experts estimate that Bidens plan would mean higher taxes on average for all income groups, those increases would be relatively small for all but the biggest earners.  The 30-second version of the ad opens with a narrator saying, Sometimes, politicians accidentally tell the truth, before cutting to the clip of Biden from the South Carolina event. Guess what, if you elect me, your taxes are going to be raised, not cut, Biden says. The ad replays the clip later, in between additional narration. The New York Times says Bidens tax increases are more than double Hillary Clintons plan. Even the Tax Policy Center admits taxes would increase on all income groups, the narrator says, before showing the clip a second time. Big tax increases, crushing our recovery. The spot finishes with Biden saying, It could go higher. America First Actions portrayal of Bidens comments in South Carolina gives the impression that Biden told a crowd that all Americans would have their tax rates raised on his watch. Thats not the case. When Biden said your taxes are going to be raised, not cut, he wasnt talking about his plan for all taxpayers. He was addressing one person at the February event. The person indicated that they had benefited from the Republican-led tax bill that became law under President Donald Trump. The exchange took place after Biden said, By the way, how many of you did really well with that $1.9 trillion tax cut? Really good shape, right? The crowd mostly laughed or groaned, but one member of the audience caught Bidens attention off camera by signaling that they benefited. Addressing that person directly, Biden said: Well, you did. Well, thats good. Im glad to see youre doing well already. But guess what, if you elect me, your taxes are going to be raised, not cut, if you benefited from that.  The full exchange shows that Biden was saying his plan would raise taxes for people who, in his words, benefited from the GOPs Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. A Biden campaign official said his point was that the wealthy — not all Americans — would not benefit from his plan. The ads portrayal of the exchange leaves a different impression. The same could be said of the ads second clip of Biden, in which he says, It could go higher. The ad doesnt specify what Biden was referring to when he made the remark. But the completeDecember interview with CNBC shows that Biden was talking specifically about the top tax rate for capital gains, the profits earned from selling property or investments, which are often taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income. We should charge people the same tax for their capital gains as their tax rate is, Biden said. And I think we should raise the tax rate back to, for example, I take it back to where it was before it was reduced. It could go higher.  America First Action frames Bidens tax plan as providing increases that are more than double Hillary Clintons plan and would impact all income groups. The ad cites a report from the New York Times and an editorial from the Wall Street Journal, both published in December, as well as a March 5 analysis from the Tax Policy Center, an independent group that models the effects of tax legislation. The New York Times said Biden was proposing more than double the tax increases proposed by Clinton, the Democratic presidential nominee in 2016. Thats accurate, said Gordon Mermin, a senior research associate at the Tax Policy Center and co-author of the March analysis. The Tax Policy Center estimated that Bidens proposals would raise revenues by 1.5% of gross domestic product over 10 years, Mermin said, citing what he said is the preferred metric for comparing across time. The groups analysis of the Clinton plan put that figure at 0.6% of GDP. But the America First Action ad was less exact in its claim that even the Tax Policy Center admits taxes would increase on all income groups. As FactCheck.org noted, thats a partial quote from the groups March report. The full sentence from the report said: In 2021, the proposals would increase taxes on average on all income groups, but the highest-income households would see substantially larger increases, both in dollar amounts and as a share of their incomes. Biden has publicly vowed not to raise taxes for those making less than $400,000 per year. His plan aims to raise up to $4 trillion in tax revenues over a decade, according to the Tax Policy Center, in part by rolling back some of the GOP-led tax laws tax cuts for corporations and for people with taxable incomes over $400,000. Among Bidens proposed changes, he would: Increase the top corporate tax rate to 28% from 21%. Raise the top individual federal income tax rate to 39.6%. Place a 12.4% Social Security tax on incomes above $400,000. Tax capital gains at the same rate as ordinary income for very high earners. The highest earners would bear the brunt of the new tax burden brought on by Bidens plan, according to the Tax Policy Center and other analyses of his proposals. The plan would lead to small, modest increases in costs for lower-income groups, Mermin said. But as weve reported, those changes would not be because of higher federal income tax rates across the board. Those small tax increases for the first four quintiles — and this is said in our brief — are almost all due to the indirect effects of the increase in the corporate tax rate, Mermin said, including lowered wages for workers. On average, the Tax Policy Centers March report predicted that the bottom 80% of earners could wind up paying between $30 and $590 extra annually on Bidens watch. It estimated that over 90% of the tax increases would be borne by the top 20% of earners. No direct taxes are imposed on any household making less than $400,000 per year, the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget wrote in its analysis of Bidens plan. RELATED: Facebook post wrongly claims Biden would hike tax rates for family earning $75,000 Biden has also added to his proposals since March, Mermin said, including pitching some tax credits that could potentially offset some of these increases for the middle-income folks. An America First Action ad showed Biden saying, Guess what, if you elect me, your taxes are going to be raised, not cut. The ad takes his words out of context. Biden was not speaking about the impact of his plan on all Americans. The comment came during a South Carolina event, when a member of his crowd said he or she had benefited from the GOP-led tax bill. The full context of the quote shows Biden saying that individuals taxes would be raised, not cut, if you benefited from that.",0.3,0.9,0.9,0.5,0.4,0.6,0.6,0.8,0.2,Mostly False

Final Rating: Mostly False  ",Californias Proposition 63 would CRIMINALIZE the sharing of ammunition between friends who may be hunting or shooting together.," Proposition 63, a gun and ammunition control initiative on Californias November ballot, would require instant background checks for the sale of ammunition statewide. Known as the Safety For All Initiative and proposed by Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom, the measure is considered a significant addition to Californias already strict gun regulations. The initiative is in some cases more stringent than gun control bills introduced by state Senate leader Kevin De León and recently signed into law by Gov. Jerry Brown. Recently, a gun rights group, the Firearms Policy Coalition, in a June 16 email blast claimed Proposition 63 would restrict not only ammo sales, but criminalize the sharing of bullets between hunting and shooting partners. The Sacramento-based coalition describes itself as a grassroots nonprofit dedicated to defending Second Amendment rights. We decided to examine the claim: Would Proposition 63 really criminalizes the sharing of bullets between friends? Our research We started by checking the text of the Proposition. It broadly restricts ammunition sales by requiring instant background checks and requiring, by January 2018, all sales be conducted or processed through a licensed ammunition vendor, according to Section 8 of the text. Law enforcement would be exempted. Currently, the state does not require a license or record keeping for ammunition sales, according to the San Francisco-based Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence. By contrast, the restrictions Proposition 63 places on sharing or transferring ammunition are not as strict. Still, they would change some aspects of the largely unregulated practice. The measure would: -- Make it illegal for an individual to share bullets with any person who he or she knows or using reasonable care should know is banned from owning or possessing ammunition; -- Make it illegal for someone to share bullets if they know they will be subsequently sold or transferred to a person banned from owning them; -- Require individuals meet face-to-face to transfer ammunition; The new crimes would be classified as a misdemeanors, punishable by up to one year in jail and a $1,000 fine, according to the measure. They are listed under proposed changes to Sections 30306 and 30312 of the California Penal Code. They could still freely transfer and share that ammunition with their hunting and shooting partners provided that they do so in person and do not have knowledge that the ammunition would subsequently be provided to a felon or other prohibited person, Dan Newman, spokesman for the Safety For All Initiative, wrote in an email. Representatives from the Firearms Policy Coalition did not respond to our requests for comment. An AK-47 rifle 30-round magazine is seen with 30 rounds of 7.62x39mm ammunition, in Alexandria, Va., Wednesday, Feb. 10, 2016. (AP Photo/Cliff Owen) Our ruling The Firearms Policy Coalition recently claimed Californias Proposition 63 would Criminalize the sharing of ammunition between friends who may be hunting or shooting together. The initiative would create some new restrictions on bullet sharing. It would be it illegal to knowingly share bullets with a felon; to share with any other person banned from owning them; or with anyone who would subsequently share them with a banned person. It would also require people meet face-to-face to transfer ammunition. Breaking the new rules would be considered a misdemeanor. The coalitions statement, however, gives the wrong and overly broad impression that friends on a hunting trip or at a shooting range could never legally share a bullet -- that somehow the measure would criminalize all aspects of sharing a box of bullets with your shooting partner. Instead, the vast majority of people could keep sharing, as long as they know or within reason should know theyre not sharing with a felon or another person prohibited from owning a gun and ammunition.

Final Rating: Mostly False  ",Greg Abbott did nothing to pursue reports of the sexual abuse of boys at a West Texas state-run school.,"In a TV ad suggesting Greg Abbott failed to act when allegations of misconduct came to his office, Wendy Davis reminds Texans of the sexual abuse scandal that touched off a 2007 legislative overhaul of the Texas Youth Commission. In the ad, a narrator says in a dark tone: Young boys at a state-run school are sexually abused. When a local investigation lags, a Texas Ranger notifies Attorney General Greg Abbott, asking him to investigate. Abbott does nothing, the narrator says, adding that 11 months then went by with more incidents of abuse and neglect. But Abbott didnt pursue the case, the narrator says. By way of backup, the Davis campaign offered news stories describing attempts by a Texas Ranger to get authorities outside of West Texas, including the attorney general, to look into the alleged incidents at the West Texas State School in Pyote. We reviewed those news reports and others, which together chronicled initial inaction by a state lawyer before Abbotts office presented the related allegations to a grand jury. Abbott does nothing? Public knowledge of alleged sexual wrongdoing by officials at the remote school traces to February 2007 news reports by the Texas Observer and Dallas Morning News. But a Texas Ranger, Brian Burzynski, had been on the case for years and had already reached out to the state for help. Burzynski emailed an assistant state attorney general, Will Tatum, on Feb. 21, 2006, graphically detailing sexual abuse of male youths at the school, according to information released by Abbotts office in March 2007. The Rangers email said the local prosecutor had the case but hasn't done anything with it and I am losing hope that he will. ... I would like you to view this report and tell me what you think. Burzynski had begun his investigation in February 2005. According to Abbotts office, Tatum declined to pursue the case because of jurisdictional concerns; under state law, the attorney generals office needed a local prosecutor to ask for assistance before it could get involved. As Burzynskis emailed request became public, Abbotts state spokesman, Jerry Strickland, said Tatum still should have forwarded the report to his supervisors before responding to the email, but he didn't follow agency procedures, according to news reports at the time. Knowing the seriousness of the allegations contained in that email, action would have been taken by the attorney general's office, and this agency would have actively engaged in the matter in any way possible, Strickland said. But Strickland also said that two days after Burzynski sent the email, Tatum correctly told the Ranger that the Ward County district attorney, Randall Reynolds, would have to ask Abbott's office for help on the case. An April 2007 Austin American-Statesman news story said Tatum sent Burzynski the name and address of his supervisor, Adrien McFarland, for the Ranger to give to Reynolds. Abbott acted in 2007 Strickland said the attorney general's office began an aggressive investigation after Reynolds asked for help; that request came in Jan. 17, 2007. In April 2007, a Ward County grand jury returned 13 indictments against two former school administrators for improper sexual conduct with six students, ages 16-19, the attorney generals office announced at the time. Abbott and other state prosecutors appeared before the grand jury to present the charges against former Texas Youth Commission officials Ray Edward Brookins and John Paul Hernandez, Abbotts office said. Abbott said at the time: With today's indictments, the victims of sexual abuse at West Texas State School are a step closer to the justice they deserve. According to the state announcement, on April 4, 2007, District Judge Bob Parks had granted the attorney generals office sole authority to investigate and prosecute allegations of abuse at the Ward County facility. Parks appointed the attorney general as District Attorney Pro Tem after the local district attorney recused himself from the case, the announcement said. Footnote: In April 2010, a jury sentenced Brookins to 10 years in prison on his conviction for sexual relations with a teenage inmate. In 2011, a jury acquitted Hernandez on 14 counts of molesting boys in 2004 and 2005. Texas law on the attorney general and criminal prosecutions Generally, the April 2007 Statesman news story pointed out, the Texas attorney general is an executive who primarily defends the state in civil disputes, though in local criminal cases involving fraud in insurance, Medicaid or elections, the attorney general can usually find a way to involve himself, one way or another. His staff, using a provision in the penal code dealing with computer crimes, can even initiate investigations into the solicitation of sex from minors on the Internet. Charges like the ones from West Texas, the story said, are off-limits until a local prosecutor requests assistance in writing. Eric Nichols, deputy attorney general for criminal justice, told the newspaper the state agency followed the letter of the law. At the time, the Texas Government Code said: A prosecuting attorney may request the assistance of the attorney general in the prosecution of all manner of criminal cases or in performing any duty imposed by law on the prosecuting attorney. In requesting such assistance, a prosecuting attorney may appoint any assistant attorney general as an assistant prosecuting attorney. The 2007 Legislature amended the law to say the attorney general may offer assistance in any criminal prosecution. Another adopted revision: The attorney general may offer assistance in the prosecution of criminal offenses concerning the Texas Youth Commission. The Statesman story said two lawmakers, Democratic Reps. Jim McReynolds of Lufkin and Jim Dunnam of Waco, questioned Nichols about whether Abbotts office should initially have done more: Even if he couldn't initiate prosecution, couldn't he have picked up the phone and called Reynolds, or even the governor, the state's chief executive officer? Nichols said in an interview at the time that Abbotts aides assumed the local prosecutor was doing his job. Do you automatically draw the conclusion that nothing is going to happen? Nichols asked. On the other hand, the Statesman story said, it might not have mattered whether someone in the attorney general's office called Reynolds to offer help. Burzynski told lawmakers in 2007 that Reynolds continually assured him he would prosecute the case. The story said Reynolds had said little in his defense except to blame politics or a breakdown in communications. A timeline accompanying the story said Abbott learned of the West Texas investigation at a meeting of senior agency staff Jan. 22, 2007. On March 9, 2007, Abbott announced the grand jury would soon begin hearing the case. Our ruling In her ad, Davis said Greg Abbott did nothing to pursue reports of the sexual abuse of boys at a state-run school. In 2006, Abbotts office reacted to a Rangers report detailing such allegations by saying a local prosecutor needed to seek state assistance--and a state lawyer reportedly did nothing more. But this charge ignores a pivotal development. In 2007, after the local prosecutor requested help, state attorneys overseen by Abbott steered a grand-jury presentation leading to indictments.

On May 23, Senate Democrats tried to change the media narrative by holding a news event at a gas station near Capitol Hill. The Senate Democrats collective Twitter account documented the event. The account posted a Spanish-language tweet featuring a clip of Sen. Bob Menendez, D-N.J., talking about high gasoline prices and placing the blame on Trump. The Spanish-language text says: El precio de combustible ha aumentado un 25% este año. Los analistas dicen que el presidente tiene la culpa. Gracias @realDonaldTrump.

(Menendez, speaking in Spanish in the tweets uploaded video clip, didnt use those exact words and didnt cite a percentage increase.) So is the tweet correct that gas prices are up 25 percent since the start of the year? Not quite. While prices have increased, they havent risen by that much. We turned to data from the Energy Information Administration, a federal statistical clearinghouse. We found that retail gasoline prices were $2.52 a gallon on Jan. 1, 2018, and rose to $2.92 on May 21, 2018. Thats an increase of 15.9 percent — a distinct bump, but smaller than the tweet had said. When we looked at crude oil prices, the increase was a bit larger than for gasoline but still not 25 percent. On Jan. 2, 2018, crude was $60.37 a barrel and on May 21 it was $72.26. Thats an increase of 19.7 percent. Sandy Fielden, a commodities analyst at Morningstar Inc., told thestreet.com in late April that Trump may be at least a partial cause of the price rise, citing threats of a trade war with China, heightened tensions in the Middle East, and the U.S. exit from the Iran nuclear deal, Fielden said. All these bearish factors pushing prices higher are arguably directly caused by Trump administration policies, Fielden told the website. Trumps suggestion that the OPEC oil-producing companies may be to blame for higher prices is definitely a case of the pot calling the kettle black. After we inquired with the Democratic Senate leadership, the tweet was deleted and a replacement was posted. The new tweets caption stuck closely to Menendez wording in the video, saying, El precio de gasolina sigue subiendo y subiendo. Y es por consecuencia, en gran parte, de la política del presidente. (That translates as, The price of gasoline keeps rising and rising. And it is, to a large extent, due to the president's policies.) The Democratic staff on the Senate Finance Committee subsequently told PolitiFact that the 25 percent figure stemmed from a math error and has since corrected the report it came from. El precio de gasolina sigue subiendo y subiendo. Y es por consecuencia, en gran parte, de la política del presidente. pic.twitter.com/yLbrmBwtxR The original version of the tweet said, El precio de combustible ha aumentado un 25% este año, which translates as, The price of gas has increased 25% this year. Gas prices have risen, but not by that much — 15.9 percent, rather than 25 percent.",0.4,0.6,1.0,0.5,0.0,0.5,0.5,0.8,0.7,Mostly False

Final Rating: Mostly False  ",It has been over 80 years since a lame-duck president appointed a Supreme Court justice.,"The death of U.S. Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia was a key topic at the start of the Republican presidential debate in South Carolina Saturday night. Some of the candidates, including Sen. Marco Rubio, called on President Barack Obama to hold back on his replacement and leave the decision to the next president. I do not believe the president should appoint someone, said Rubio, a Florida senator. And it's not unprecedented. In fact, it has been over 80 years since a lame-duck president has appointed a Supreme Court justice. Lets see what history shows about lame-duck presidential picks to the Supreme Court. We emailed spokespersons for Rubio and did not hear back. Nominations Technically presidents dont appoint a justice to the Supreme Court. They nominate someone who is then confirmed by the U.S. Senate. Theres also the problem of whether Obama should be considered a lame duck or not. Some would say Obama isnt a lame duck until after Election Day in November when his successor is chosen. Others might say all second-term presidents are lame ducks because they know they wont serve again. The definition has evolved, said Larry J. Sabato, director of the Center for Politics at the University of Virginia. Decades ago, the lame-duck label was applied to a president after an election, but the term has changed over time to include any officeholder in his or her last term. Either way, election-year Supreme Court nominations are rare. Rubios statement prompted several comments on Twitter from those who noted a specific exception to his claim: the nomination of Justice Anthony Kennedy. The Senate confirmed Kennedy 97-0 on Feb. 4, 1988. That was about 28years ago -- not 80. Kennedy replaced Justice Lewis Powell, who retired, and was Reagans third nomination for the opening, after Robert Bork and Douglas Ginsburg. Powell announced his retirement in June 1987. Reagan, who was in his second term, nominated Kennedy in November 1987. Kennedy was confirmed in February 1988. In November 1988, Reagans vice president George H.W. Bush won the presidency. The nomination actually wasn't in the election year, although the confirmation vote was, said Harvard law professor Mark Tushnet. This came up minutes later in the debate, when U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas said, We have 80 years of precedent of not confirming Supreme Court justices in an election year. Debate moderator John Dickerson of CBS News corrected Cruz by noting that Kennedy was confirmed in 1988. Were not certain which nomination Rubio was referring to 80 years ago. One possibility is when President Herbert Hoover nominated Benjamin Nathan Cardozo to fill a vacancy in February 1932, and Cardozo was confirmed that same month. Hoover then went on to lose re-election later that year. But Hoover was not a lame duck; he was eligible for re-election even though he lost, said Russell Wheeler, an expert on the courts at the Brookings Institution and former deputy director of the Federal Judicial Center. As of 2010, the Senate has rejected 16 of 34 Supreme Court nominations because of opposition to the nominating president, according to a 2010 Congressional Research Service report. Seven of the rejected nominations were put forward by presidents in their final year in office after a new president had been elected but before the successor took over. But those were more than 80 years ago. Each of these lame duck nominations transpired under 19th century presidents when the post-election period lasted from early November until early March, the report states. Our ruling Rubio said, It has been over 80 years since a lame-duck president appointed a Supreme Court justice. The most recent contradiction of this claim would be Reagans nomination of Kennedy. Kennedy was nominated in November 1987 and confirmed during Reagans final year of office in February 1988. Reagans timeline doesnt exactly line up with what Obama faces; Reagan had more time between his nomination and the end of his presidency. But its hard for us to see how Obama can be considered a lame duck but not Reagan. Both were second-term presidents who knew they would not serve again but did not yet know who their successor would be.",0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,Mostly False

Final Rating: Mostly False  ","One person, Kathleen Sebelius, was going to determine whether or not 10-year-old lung patient Sarah Murnaghan would live or die.","Many Americans were transfixed recently by the story of Sarah Murnaghan, a 10-year-old Pennsylvania girl with cystic fibrosis whose family won a court battle to improve her chances of getting a lung transplant. Under the existing transplant rule, Murnaghan was too young to qualify for a place on the waiting list for adult lungs. So the girls family asked Kathleen Sebelius, the secretary of health and human services, to waive the rule. On May 31, 2013, Sebelius did order a policy review of the age requirements, but that option could take months -- likely longer than the girl could afford to wait. Sebelius declined to waive the rule in a way that would quickly aid her. Sebelius explained her reasoning to a House committee, saying there are about 40 very seriously ill Pennsylvanians over the age of 12 also waiting for a lung transplant, and three other children in the Philadelphia (area) at the same acuity rate as Sarah waiting for a lung transplant. The decisions of the  transplant committee -- which is not bureaucrats; it's transplant surgeons and health care providers who design the protocol -- are based on their best medical judgment of the most appropriate way to decide allocation in an impossibly difficult situation. But Sebelius found herself overruled on June 5, 2013, when U.S. District Judge Michael Baylson ordered her to temporarily waive the rule, allowing Murnaghan to join the adult list. At the House committee hearing, two Republican lawmakers -- Reps. Tom Price of Georgia and Lou Barletta of Pennsylvania-- grilled Sebelius about her role in the Murnaghan case. Soon after, conservative commentators, including Sean Hannity and Rush Limbaugh, took up the 10-year-olds cause and used it to criticize the Obama administration. Sebelius had already been under attack from conservatives for her role in implementing President Barack Obamas health care law. In discussing the Murnaghan case, Limbaugh drew a parallel with Sarah Palin's famous death panels claim, which suggested that the government could determine who lives and dies. (We awarded it our 2009 Lie of the Year.) On his June 6 show, Limbaugh told listeners, Until the judge moved in, Kathleen Sebelius was the death panel. One person, Kathleen Sebelius, was going to determine whether or not (Murnaghan lived or died), and she said, Some people live. Some people die.  All the while, the regime is denying, of course, that there were death panels and that Obamacare was not going to be doing this, and everybody knew that it was. We wondered whether Limbaugh was correct when he said that Sebelius was the sole decision maker. Where Limbaugh has a point Limbaugh is correct that Sebelius did have the power to overrule the age requirements of the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network -- the entity that oversees transplants in the United States. According to the current organ-transplant rules, which were adopted under President Bill Clinton, the networks board of directors is responsible for developing policies for the equitable allocation of organs. However, the rules allow an appeals process to the HHS secretary. The secretary can either reject the complaint, direct the network to revise the policies or practices or take such other action as the secretary determines appropriate. Its worth noting that the HHS secretary has not traditionally taken a hands-on role overseeing day-to-day transplant policy. And historically, a decision to change the rules based on one or two patients cases would be unusual, said I. Glenn Cohen, co-director of the Petrie-Flom Center for Health Law Policy, Biotechnology, and Bioethics at Harvard Law School. Still, Tait Sye, an HHS spokesman, did not dispute that Sebelius had a role in the process. He said that Sebelius decision not to issue a waiver -- at least until told by the judge to do so -- stemmed from her belief that medical experts, not a government official, should take priority. The interest of patients on the transplant list will not be well served by having an individual reach in and unilaterally change an organ allocation policy, Sye said. Given the specifics of the Murnaghan case, we think its reasonable to say that Sebelius, in her role as a source of appeal for the transplantation network, had a role in determining the likelihood of the girl being placed on a transplant list. How Limbaugh ignored others involved in the decision The problem with Limbaughs claim is that he uses the term one person, boiling down what amounts to a life-or-death question to Sebelius alone. Thats not accurate. For starters, if Sebelius had given her blessing immediately to the transplant-list switch, it wouldnt have determined Murnaghans life or death. Switching Murnaghan to the adult list would likely improve her chance of survival, but whether she actually survives depends on the availability of organs, whether they match with Murnaghans blood type, who else ranks ahead of her on the list, how well her own health holds up while awaiting surgery, and how successful the transplant surgery is. More importantly, the system for deciding who gets organ transplants includes several layers of responsibility. The guidelines were put together in an exhaustive rulemaking process, with wide public input. On an ongoing basis, the medical experts on the networks board interpret and enforce these rules. Then, Sebelius serves as a court of appeal. Finally, a federal judge has the power to overrule her appeal, as one did in this case. So there are many people who collectively enforce and interpret the rules. The national organ-allocation network is developed around a consensus of medical expertise and is meant to apply to all transplant candidates ... not to apply uniquely to one individual, said Joel Newman, a spokesman for the United Network for Organ Sharing, which manages the organ-sharing network under contract to the Department of Health and Human Services. Newman added that the rules are designed to provide as many individuals as possible an equitable opportunity to receive a transplant. Several bioethicists we contacted said that despite the obvious sympathy people have for patients like Murnaghan, Sebelius had sound reasons to act as she did. I don't think it would be proper to change the rules for one person rather than alter the entirety of the criteria for who gets priority, Cohen said. Arthur Caplan, a New York University bioethicist, agreed. The system of rules is built on decisions by medical and transplant experts in the area, in this case lungs, he said. No one person can or should have all authority over rationing organs. Appeals to the government or the courts need to be weighed carefully, because by intervening, the authority and legitimacy of an evidence-based, neutral system is put into doubt, and that is not a good thing for society or those waiting for transplants. Jonathan Moreno, a professor of medical ethics and health policy at the University of Pennsylvania, noted that a switch in Murnaghans status is not risk-free. Her medical condition, size and other factors compromise her chances, and a failure here means two dead -- Sarah, and the patient who didn't get the organ, Moreno said. Our ruling Limbaugh said that one person, Kathleen Sebelius, was going to determine whether or not 10-year-old lung patient Sarah Murnaghan would live or die, essentially serving as a one-woman death panel. Its true that Sebelius played an appeals role in the transplant-policy process. However, she was not the only person or entity that did -- existing rules, medical experts and a federal judge also played a role in Murnaghans case. In addition, Sebelius didnt have the power to grant or revoke life; many factors, including the availability and suitability of organs, will ultimately determine her likelihood of survival. UPDATE: On June 12, 2013, Murnaghan underwent lung transplant surgery.",0.3,0.8,0.9,0.4,0.6,0.7,0.5,1.0,0.5,Mostly False

Final Rating: Mostly False  ",Prop 56 cheats schools out of at least $600 million.," Opponents of Proposition 56, Californias proposed $2 per pack cigarette tax hike, are flooding radio airwaves with attacks on the measure. The initiative is one of many on the states November ballot. The No on 56 campaign is funded by tobacco companiesPhillip Morris and R.J. Reynolds. Its campaign says online and in radio ads that the measure cheats schools out of at least $600 million a year. The industry attacks are not surprising. And theyll likely continue as opponents of the measure have raised more than $35 million, while supporters have collected about $17 million. We wondered whether theres any truth to the claim that Prop 56 cheats schools out of all that money. Our research Nearly three decades ago, voters in California approved Proposition 98 requiring a minimum level of funding for public education. It requires the state to dedicate roughly 40 percent of new General Fund revenues to K-12 schools and community colleges. Prop 56 would generateup to $1.4 billion in tax revenue its first year. But instead of sending that revenue to the General Fund, Prop 56 would place it in a special fund to help pay for Medi-Cal, which provides health coverage for millions of low-income Californians. We asked the No on 56 campaign for evidence that the tobacco tax measure cheats schools. A spokeswoman pointed to language in the measure that exempts Prop 56 from the school funding guarantee. The campaign said this exemption is proof that the measure undermines the funding guarantee and cheats schools. But the experts we spoke with say theres nothing new about this proposal. Past tobacco taxes, in 1988 and 1998, also established special funds rather than sending money to the General Fund. One of the experts said the opponents claim is misleading. When I think of this claim that the schools are going to be cheated -- particularly that word cheated out of this money -- that suggests something thats wrong or illegal. And this is not the case, said Steve Boilard, executive director of Sacramento State Universitys Center for California Studies. Theres plenty of examples where new revenue is raised that is not subject to the Prop 98 funding guarantee. Boilard pointed to Proposition 63, a tax on wealthy Californians that funds mental health services.  Curran Kelleher / Flickr Others reject claim State Superintendent of Public Instruction Tom Torlakson rejected the claim that the new tax measure cheats schools. In a recent letter circulated by the Yes on 56 campaign, he wrote: Make no mistake, Proposition 56 will not divert a dime away from schools. Rather, it will raise revenues for school based tobacco prevention and intervention programs. A report by the Legislative Analysts Office estimates Prop 56 will add $20 million for those school based programs. The Sacramento Bees fact-checking team, PoliGRAPH,recently examined the same claim about Prop 56 cheating schools. It found that it isnt fair to say the measure 'cheats'schools out of $600 million a year. Nothing in the measure reduces school funding. If the measure passes, the budget for schools does not decrease. Our ruling The No on 56 campaign is running ads that say the proposedtobacco tax cheats schools out of at least $600 million a year. The measure includes an exemption from the states school fundingguarantee. A portion of its revenues, estimated at up to $1.4 billion, could otherwise have been directed toward school funding. But past tobacco taxes and a tax to fund mental health services have also legally avoided this guarantee. Those had exemptions allowing their revenues to fund health services. This doesn't mean, however, that money will be taken from schools or community colleges under Prop 56. The measure, in fact, sends about $20 million to schools for tobacco prevention programs. The claim that Prop 56 cheats schools goes too far. It might have been accurate to say the measure exempts most all revenue from going to schools. But the term chosen by No on 56 is misleading.

Final Rating: Mostly False  ",Says Donald Trump bans disabled veterans from his high rise.,"A PAC supporting Marco Rubio says Donald Trump mistreats those less fortunate than him -- including disabled veterans. Trump bans disabled veterans from his high rise, states the ad by the Conservative Solutions PAC. The ad has aired in San Francisco and multiple markets in Florida, including Miami and Tampa. Did the New York billionaire give the boot to disabled veterans from his high rise? No, he didnt do that. Instead, he wanted to ban disabled veterans who were given special licenses to peddle from selling their wares in front of his high rise. It is simply not true and a misrepresentation of the facts in every way, Trump spokeswoman Hope Hicks told PolitiFact Florida. A few days after the ad started running on TV, the PAC changed the wording of the line about veterans. We are putting the ads original claim on the Truth-O-Meter, but we will explain how and why the PAC tweaked the wording. Trumps Fifth Avenue high rise Trump wanted to get rid of street vendors around the Trump Tower, a 68-story condo and retail building on Fifth Avenue. The ad shows a Jan. 28, 2016, headline from the Daily Beast: Donald Trump wanted vets kicked off Fifth Avenue. (A spokesman for the PAC referred PolitiFact to the Daily Beast article and the New York Daily News article cited within it.) Peddling exemptions for disabled veterans have a long history in New York. First approved by the state in 1894, the exemption allowed disabled veterans to peddle on any commercial street or park throughout the state. In 1991, the state Legislature took up a bill to amend the law. Most peddling was prohibited on Fifth Avenue -- but 176 disabled veterans still had permission to peddle there. Trump wrote a letter to John Dearie, then-chairman of the state Assemblys Committee on Cities, according to the New York Daily News: While disabled veterans should be given every opportunity to earn a living, is it fair to do so to the detriment of the city as a whole or its tax-paying citizens and businesses? Trump wrote. Do we allow Fifth Avenue, one of the worlds finest and most luxurious shopping districts, to be turned into an outdoor flea market, clogging and seriously downgrading the area? In July 1991, New York City Mayor David Dinkins announced that an agreement had been reached with the Fifth Avenue Association, which represented hundreds of businesses. The businesses would offer disabled veterans jobs at twice the minimum wage, and the association would set up a fund to pay for job training, education or to move vendors to other parts of the city. The next month, then-Gov. Mario Cuomo signed a bill to repeal the peddling, but only for four years. In 1995, when the bill was up for renewal, the Legislature struck a compromise that banned peddling from Midtown Manhattan but included a plan to allow it in other zones to be defined later. Months later, some veterans continued to peddle in the banned area. In 2004, Trump complained about the vendors in a letter to then-Mayor Michael Bloomberg. Whether they are veterans or not, they (the vendors) should not be allowed to sell on this most important and prestigious shopping street, Trump wrote, according to the New York Post. Trump wrote that business owners had to repeatedly clean up debris left as a result of the vendors. Frankly, I have no idea how they can be doing business with the mess they have outside their front door, he wrote. Fifth Avenues comeback is going to be a short one if this situation is not corrected immediately. In response to his letter, a small group of protesters waved signs in front of Trump Tower that read, Vendors to Trump: You're Fired! and Why can't vets vend on streets we die to protect? We told the PACs spokesman that the ad could cause viewers to wrongly assume that Trump wanted to ban disabled veterans from living in his high rise. Ad didnt mention living, Jeff Sadosky replied. PAC changes ad After we started our fact-check, the PAC changed the wording of the ad. The original ad started Feb. 26, according to the Political TV Ad Archive, a website that tracks campaign ads and partnered with PolitiFact and other fact-checkers. On Feb. 29, Factcheck.org wrote that the ad was miseading and left out crucial details. By that date, the ad had aired at least 135 times in the Miami, Tampa and Orlando markets. PolitiFact first contacted the PAC about the ad on Feb. 29 and then later noticed on TV that the script had changed. The original ad said that Trump bans disabled veterans from his high rise. But the new version said that Trump bans veterans from in front of his high rise. Sadosky said the PAC changed the ad on March 1 to be more specific. Our ruling A pro-Rubio Super PAC said Trump bans disabled veterans from his high rise. The TV ad is misleading because viewers could assume that Trump tried to ban disabled veterans from living in his high rise. His beef was with street vendors including disabled veterans who were given special vendor licenses selling wares around his Trump Tower.Nothing in the ad makes it clear that this related to vendors selling on the street.",0,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,Mostly False

Final Rating: Mostly False  ","If we pass immigration reform, it will make wages go up on average $250 for the average household.","While presidential candidate and former Maryland Gov. Martin OMalley was in Austin on a campaign stop, he said immigration reform would pay off for all Americans through their paychecks. In a Nov. 12, 2015 interview on Overheard with Evan Smith, OMalley discussed President Barack Obamas executive order on immigration, and whether he would take similar action. OMalley told Smith he believes the country needs immigration reform because its something important for the economy of the United States. If we pass immigration reform, it will make wages go up on average $250 for the average household, he elaborated. Why? Because youre getting 11 million people in many times off-the-books jobs onto the open economy of the United States of America. The number of undocumented immigrants in the United States has hovered around 11 million since 2009, according to a July 2015 report from the Pew Research Center, evaluating data through 2014. Undocumented immigrants make up 5.1 percent of the U.S. labor force, Pew reported in July 2015. We dont and cant check predictions. Still, we wondered whether it was true, based on research, that immigration reform could mean $250 more for the average American household, as OMalley said. Long-term figure OMalleys campaign press secretary, Haley Morris, said the governor got the $250 figure from a July 2013 White House report, published in support of a 2013 Senate immigration reform bill. That report, The Economic Benefits of Fixing Our Broken Immigration System, states that in the long run, the Senate bill raises wages for all groups of workers by boosting productivity. The White Houses conclusion relies on the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Offices analysis of the economic impact of that bill, the Border Security, Economic Opportunity, and Immigration Modernization Act.  The $250 figure OMalley cites is certainly long term. It refers to a rise in wages between 2013 and 2033 – and doesnt otherwise estimate year-by-year changes. As the White House report breaks it down: CBO estimates that real wages will be 0.5 percent higher in 2033 than projected under current law. In todays terms, that would be equivalent to an additional $250 of income for the median American household. Wages would increase partly because immigration reform would lead to a higher rate of return on capital throughout the next two decades. A web search led us to George Borjas, a labor economist specializing in immigration issues at Harvards John F. Kennedy School of Government. He questioned the assumptions behind the CBOs calculation. To reach its conclusion about immigration reforms effect on wages, the CBO report uses a positivity effect, a name for the effect of a correlation between state GDP and immigration. However, Borjas says, the relationship between higher state GDP and immigration could be correlation, not causation, which would put the $250 figure into question. Borjas, who reviewed the report at our request, said: Maybe immigrants are smart enough to realize they should settle in states with high productivity. Other research released when the bill in question was in the Senate in 2013 supported the CBOs analysis. An August 2013 article from the Brookings Institution compared the bills potential effects to immigrations historical impact on the economy, finding that on average, previous waves of immigrants tended to boost American wages. On the other hand, neither analysis said American households would see an immediate or steady spike in income. Lower wages in the short term Even if the long-term $250 figure holds true, the CBO concluded that comprehensive immigration reform actually would lead to lower average wages in the short-term before boosting overall productivity. In the first decade, according to its analysis, average wages would decrease by 0.1 percent. By the CBO's estimates, average wages would be slightly lower than under current law through 2024 before they rise above current wages the following decade. Comprehensive immigration reform also would lead to a temporary imbalance in the labor market, causing slightly higher unemployment through 2020, when the labor market would adjust. Wages would be lower at first, the CBO says, because growth of the workforce would outpace capital available. In addition, new workers would be less skilled and have lower wages, affecting average wages for the entire workforce. Brookings pointed out that wage decreases would be larger for workers with some high school or only a high school diploma, who would be more likely to compete with new workers, compared to college graduates.  Other considerations Immigration reforms effects on the economy extend beyond immediate and long-term effects on average wages. As Gregory Wright, an assistant professor of economics at University of California-Merced who studies international trade and migration, points out, Immigrants are very entrepreneurial relative to the native population, and high-skill immigrants tend to generate a disproportionate number of patents and are more innovative by other measures. In another section of its report, the CBO specifies that immigrants receive patents at twice the rate of the native-born U.S. population. Additionally, Wright says, immigration reform would create work through demand-side channels. Moving undocumented workers into the open would allow them to raise their own standard of living and they would subsequently demand more housing, education and generally more of all goods and services, which generates work for others, Wright said. Increasing the sheer number of people in the workforce raises output and consumption, or GDP, Wright says. The CBO estimated that immigration reform would raise real GDP by 3.3 percent in 2023 and by 5.4 percent in 2033. Immigrants entering the official workforce will then pay taxes, supporting the aging U.S. population, Wright added. Our ruling OMalleys claim that immigration reform would make wages go up on average $250 for the average household would not be accurate anytime soon. The $250 in question is a calculation based on mathematical assumptions -- assumptions that some question -- that refers to a long-term result over two decades. In the near term, the same analysis projects wages would dip slightly. OMalleys statement contains an element of truth, but the wage-raising conclusion is misleading.

Final Rating: Mostly False",I negotiated open borders to let fleeing refugees into safety from Kosovo.,"As a way of burnishing her credentials to be commander in chief, Sen. Hillary Clinton made a number of claims during an interview with CNN, including, I negotiated open borders to let fleeing refugees into safety from Kosovo. On May 14, 1999, first lady Clinton visited a refugee camp in Skopje, Macedonia, for ethnic Albanians leaving Kosovo. The trip received extensive press coverage focused on the plight of families trying to escape violence at the hands of Serbian forces. I want to send a message to the refugees that we do not intend to let the evil which (Yugoslavia President Slobodan) Milosevic perpetrated against these people keep them away from their homeland and their homes, Clinton said on the trip. Hillary Clinton's campaign has put forward statements from former Bill Clinton administration officials about the importance of the trip. Richard C. Holbrooke, who negotiated the 1995 Dayton Accords ending the war in Yugoslavia and is supporting Sen. Clinton's presidential bid, said the first lady pressed officials on her trip to keep borders open and then continued to lobby for refugees when she returned to Washington. After visiting refugees and gaining a first-hand assessment of the situation, the first lady had intense talks with President Gligorov and Prime Minister Georgievski, Holbrooke said in a written statement. In these talks, one in the Presidential Palace, another in the residence of the American Ambassador, Christopher Hill, Mrs. Clinton pressed the Macedonian government to fully open the border so that Kosovar Albanian refugees could flee the war zone to safety. The trip seemed more designed to gain media coverage than to conduct substantive diplomacy, however. Clinton visited the area for less than 12 hours, arriving at 9:20 a.m. and leaving at 5:45 p.m. According to the itinerary provided to news organizations, she arrived at the camp and was briefed on relief efforts at 10 a.m., toured the camp at 11 a.m., and met with nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) at 1:30 p.m. Her meetings with officials appear to have been brief. Holbrooke is correct on some of the details he mentions, but the meetings all took place within the space of a single afternoon. The itinerary shows photo opportunities for the traveling press at 2:20 p.m. with Prime Minister Branko Crvenkovski at the U.S. Ambassador's Residence; at 2:50 p.m. with President Kiro Gligorov at the president's residence; and at 3:30 p.m. with first lady Gligorov at the president's residence. TheNew York Timesreported that her visit to the camp was so carefully scripted that administration officials chose which refugees Mrs. Clinton would speak with. Macedonia opened its borders before Clinton visited, so it seems unlikely that she personally negotiated for border openings. But the Clinton administration wanted to make sure the borders stayed open amid concern that Macedonian officials were trying to keep refugees out. In this context, her trip suggests a diplomatic visit intended to reinforce U.S. goals in the region. In her biographyLiving History, she mentions her visit and describes it as supporting the administration's diplomatic agenda around the world, but she does not mention taking part in specific negotiations. We tried and failed to find an independent expert who could speak to her role in negotiating open borders. Janusz Bugajski, an expert on the region with the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, D.C., said via e-mail of her visit, No doubt she tried to help the plight of refugees, but whether she was mandated by President Clinton to speak on behalf of the U.S. administration concerning policy in the region one would need to ask the former president. Our reading of the record shows a good deal to suggest Clinton was concerned about the plight of the people of Kosovo, but almost nothing to indicate she was a major player in border negotiations. We'll give her the benefit of the doubt for traveling to Macedonia and meeting with officials, but the way her statement is phrased, it makes her sound primarily responsible for the United States' efforts in the region. We don't find evidence to support that aside from her less-than-12-hour visit, and so we find her statement to be Barely True. ",0.3,0.7,0.8,0.4,0.2,0.5,0.6,0.9,0.5,Mostly False

Final Rating: Mostly False",Crimea was sort of taken away from President Obama.  And he wanted Russia to be out of what was called the G-8. And that was his determination.," President Donald Trump entered the G-7 summit in Biarritz, France, urging his fellow members to re-admit Russia to the group, from which it had been expelled in 2014. Other G-7 members gave the idea a cool reception. During a post-summit question-and-answer session with journalists, Trump was asked about it. Yamiche Alcindor of PBS asked Trump, Why do you think its appropriate to invite Russia to the G-7, given that theyve meddled in the 2016 election? And are you worried that if Russia does come to the G-7, that it might hurt you politically, because its only going to be a couple months before the 2020 election? Trump said it was better to have Russia inside the room than outside, but he then turned his focus to his predecessor, President Barack Obama. A lot of bad things happened with President Putin and President Obama, Trump said. Trump cited Crimea, a peninsula located on the Black Sea. Following the ousting of Ukraines pro-Russia president Viktor Yanukovych, Russian forces invaded Crimea in 2014 and officially absorbed it into Russia. (Until 1954, Crimea had previously been part of Russia.). It was sort of taken away from President Obama, Trump said. Not taken away from President Trump; taken away from President Obama. President Obama was not happy that this happened because it was embarrassing to him. Right? It was very embarrassing to him. And he wanted Russia to be out of what was called the G-8. And that was his determination. He was outsmarted by Putin. He was outsmarted. President Putin outsmarted President Obama. Experts contacted by PolitiFact said Trumps statement is filled with misleading assertions. For starters, Russia did invade and, eventually, annex Crimea during Obamas presidency -- in February and March 2014. But Russia didnt take Crimea away from either Obama or the United States – it took the region away from Ukraine, of which it which it was an internationally recognized part. Trumps statement is a very odd way of thinking about Crimea and the United States role in Ukraine, said Susanne Wengle, a political scientist at the University of Notre Dame. It is highly misleading and factually incorrect. The U.S. exercised a certain influence among certain Kiev and Ukrainian politicians – how much and whom is disputed – but the U.S. never had Crimea. In addition, Trumps phrasing – sort of taken away – soft-pedals Russias coercive actions in seizing Crimea, said Anders Åslund, a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council. This is not what you call a military occupation, Åslund said. Its also worth noting that, despite Trumps focus on his predecessor, Obama wasnt alone in opposing Russias annexation. Virtually the entire global community refused to recognize the annexation, which was the first such takeover in Europe since the end of the Cold War. Europe, the United Nations and other U.S. allies opposed the invasion and annexation, said Yoshiko Herrera, a University of Wisconsin political scientist. It wasnt just Obama who opposed it. Trumps statement is problematic for other reasons. While the Obama administration did support Russias expulsion from the G-8 over the annexation of Crimea, it did not do so unilaterally, and in fact could not have acted unilaterally. The G-7 was united behind the decision to kick out Russia from G-8, so it was a common consensus decision, Åslund said. In a communique dated March 24, 2014, the leaders of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom, the United States, the European Council and the European Commission jointly wrote that they strongly condemn Russias actions in Crimea. The signatories agreed that they would not participate in a scheduled G-8 meeting in Sochi, Russia, and that they would suspend our participation in the G-8 until Russia changes course and the environment comes back to where the G-8 is able to have a meaningful discussion. To date, the G-8 has not invited Russia back into the fold. All in all, Trump seems to find it hard to believe that there could be any reason other than embarrassment to oppose aggression and territorial dismemberment of a major European state, said Steve Sestanovich, a senior fellow for Russian and Eurasian studies at the Council on Foreign Relations. Trump said that Crimea was sort of taken away from President Obama.  And he wanted Russia to be out of what was called the G-8. And that was his determination. Obama did oppose Russias annexation of Crimea and back its expulsion from the G-8, but Trumps view leaves out much of the story. Trumps remark ignores both widespread opposition to Russians actions within Europe and among U.S. allies, as well as the strongly worded decision by the remaining G-7 nations to expel Russia from the group. It also ignores that Crimea was taken away from Ukraine, not Obama.",0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,Mostly False

Final Rating: Mostly False",Michael Bennet cast the deciding vote for the stimulus and the health care bill.,"If you're seeking to tie your opponent to two controversial bills, what better way to do it than to say he cast the deciding vote to pass them? That's exactly what the National Republican Senatorial Committee is doing in the Colorado Senate race between incumbent Democrat Michael Bennet and GOP nominee Ken Buck.On Oct. 6, 2010, the Senate Republicans' campaign arm ran an ad attacking Bennet's role in helping pass two Democratic-sponsored bills, the economic stimulus and the health care overhaul.One vote makes a difference, the narrator says. Michael Bennet cast the deciding vote for Obama's stimulus that wasted billions, added to the debt and didn't create the jobs they promised. Bennet cast the deciding vote to allow passage of the trillion-dollar health care bill that slashed Medicare, hurting seniors. Bennet's vote was the key to billions in job-killing taxes, too. Michael Bennet: He's been their vote, not Colorado's.We won't tackle the ad's description of the substance of the two bills. (We've addressed some of those points in the past.) Instead, we'll look at whether it's fair to call Bennet the deciding vote on those bills.First, some background on how the bills passed. Both measures had long and roundabout legislative paths to President Barack Obama's desk, but we'll stick to the two votes the ad specifically references on screen.The stimulus vote cited in the ad was taken Feb. 13, 2009. It was to approve the conference report of the bill -- that is, the version that both chambers must pass with identical language. Once both chambers pass identical versions, the bill goes to the president to be signed. For the stimulus, the final vote was 60-38, with exactly the number of votes needed to meet the three-fifths supermajority required of most major actions in the Senate.Meanwhile, the health care vote mentioned in the ad was taken Dec. 23, 2009. The vote was to invoke cloture -- that is, to cut off debate so that consideration of the bill could proceed. Invoking cloture requires 60 votes, and in this case the Democrats once again got exactly the 60 votes required.The idea that the Democrats couldn't spare even a single vote is the crux of the NRSC's argument.Absolutely Michael Bennet was the deciding vote, NRSC spokesman Brian Walsh told PolitiFact. Had he not done so, they wouldnt have passed the health care bill, regardless of whether he was first, middle or last to cast his vote. End of story.But is it? What about the argument that Bennet was merely one of 60 deciding votes. Couldn't the same charge be leveled at every member of the Senate who voted as Bennet did?We ran the issue by a variety of congressional scholars, and most agreed that it was a stretch for the NRSC to label Bennet's vote the deciding vote.That statement is misleading and a distortion of fact, said James Thurber, a political scientist at American University.Several experts we spoke to pointed to historical examples in which lawmakers waited until the last moment to help push the bill over the top.Norman Ornstein, a resident fellow at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, pointed to President Bill Clinton's attempt to pass the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 -- a bill that critics loathe for raising taxes but which supporters praise for eventually producing surpluses in the latter part of the decade. Lacking any Republican support in Congress, the measure faced nail-biter votes in both chambers, with then-Rep. Marjorie Margolies-Mezvinsky, D-Pa., and Sen. Bob Kerrey, D-Neb., attracting wide attention for remaining undecided until shortly before the votes and then ultimately voting yes. In Margolies-Mezvinsky's case, her loss the following year was universally blamed on that vote.Then there was the 1985 vote on President Ronald Reagan's budget by then-Sen. Pete Wilson, R-Calif. Wilson was wheeled onto the Senate floor wearing blue pajamas following surgery for a ruptured appendix. That could be called a deciding vote, said Stephen Hess, a Brookings Institution senior fellow emeritus.Indeed, there's a long and storied history of senators holding back on supporting a bill until certain demands are met, said Donald Ritchie, the historian of the Senate. This approach takes some nerve, because the undecided vote may come under fire from both sides, but the rewards can sometimes be significant, Ritchie said.So, did Bennet's approval of the stimulus and the health care bill follow the same pattern? The short answer is no.On the stimulus, Bennet spoke favorably of the bill at least as early as Jan. 31, 2009 -- two weeks before he cast the vote cited in the ad -- when the Rocky Mountain News paraphrased him saying he likes the overall direction of the legislation. He was part of a bipartisan group of 20 Senators trying to shrink the size of the stimulus, which suggests that he was sufficiently supportive of the bill that he was willing to work behind closed doors to see it succeed. His approach does not seem like that of a reluctant holdout.On health care, Bennet actually took to the Senate floor to forcefully criticize deals struck by party leaders on behalf of holdout Democratic Senators, hoping to persuade them to vote for the health care bill. Columnists opposed to reform have criticized me for saying that I am willing to lose my seat to enact meaningful health care reform, he said on Dec. 21, 2010, two days before the vote. Now, I am being asked why I didn't negotiate a special deal with leadership. In fact, there was a report this morning criticizing me because the National Republican Senatorial Committee was rejoicing that I did not ask for special favors. Only in Washington would someone be attacked for not negotiating a backroom deal. Just because others choose to engage in the same tired Washington rituals, doesn't mean that I have to. Bennet continued, So I have a message for the columnists, the political professionals, and those back home. I am not happy about the backroom deals. I am not happy that the public option was held hostage by people in our own party. I do not support rewarding delay with special deals. I will let others justify their vote and their tactics. Indeed, as the health care debate came to a climax in the Senate, a stronger case can be made that any of several other senators deserve the title of the deciding vote. In a Dec. 24, 2009, account tracing the health bill's Senate endgame, Noam N. Levey and Janet Hook of the Los Angeles Times cited Sen. Joe Lieberman, I-Conn., as a late holdout, due to his opposition to a proposal for a Medicare buy-in. That policy would have allowed certain non-senior citizens to voluntarily join the federal health care plan for the elderly.According to the article, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., knew that he had to keep Lieberman in the tent. And the next night, when Democrats gathered for a special caucus meeting, Reid did not call out the Connecticut senator, focusing instead on the need to unite and move forward. Without the Medicare buy-in, Lieberman would be the 59th vote. At the meeting, Reid turned to Sen. Ben Nelson, D-Neb., who had a long list of demands, including more restrictions on funding abortions and full federal funding to expand Nebraska's Medicaid program. ... Reid was closing in on a deal.Suddenly, another roadblock appeared: Republican opponents of the bill threatened to filibuster -- that is, indefinitely block consideration of -- an unrelated defense appropriations bill as a way of indirectly delaying the health care measure. To get around that, Reid had to convince Sen. Russ Feingold, D-Wis. -- an opponent of the defense bill for substantive reasons -- not to join the Republican blockade.Reid was unwilling to challenge Feingold on a vote of conscience,the Los Angeles Times article reported. And when Democrats gathered for yet another special caucus meeting ... Reid was ready to concede defeat. But as dejected senators began to leave, Feingold arose: He would put aside his convictions on the war, he said, and vote with his party. 'I don't think there was a dry eye in the caucus room,' said Sen. Benjamin L. Cardin, D-Md.And there was at least one more potential deciding vote -- the late Sen. Robert Byrd, D-W.Va. It wasn't a question of whether Byrd would support the bill but rather a question of whether he'd be physically able to reach the chamber to vote.Byrd had spent six weeks in the hospital earlier in 2009 with a staph infection. On the day of the vote, Byrd was pushed onto the Senate floor in his plaid wheelchair, bundled in a coat, scarf and hat, according to an account in the New York Times.Lieberman, Nelson, Feingold, Byrd -- any of them could easily have been described as the deciding vote on the health care bill. So could any of the other 56 senators voting in favor. The NRSC ad is true, but not very informative, since there were 60 deciding votes, concludes David W. Rohde, a Duke University political scientist.The NRSC ad would have been quite justified in describing Bennet's vote for either bill as crucial or necessary to passage of either bill, or even as a deciding vote. But we can't find any rationale for singling Bennet out as the deciding vote in either case. He made his support for the stimulus bill known early on and was not a holdout on either bill. To ignore that and the fact that other senators played a key role in completing the needed vote total for the health care bill, leaves out critical facts that would give a different impression from message conveyed by the ad.",0.4,0.7,0.9,0.5,0.2,0.6,0.5,0.9,0.3,Mostly False

Final Rating: Mostly False  ","Says the Defense Department shrink-wrapped $10.8 billion in American money, loaded it on 175 pallets and put it on a transport plane to Iraq where they passed out $100 bills and no one has any receipts.","Cleveland Democratic Rep. Dennis Kucinich blasts the Iraq war every chance he gets. With Republicans promising budget cuts now that theyve taken control of the U.S. House of Representatives, its not surprising whats at the top of Kucinichs list of potential trims.To meet your stated purpose of protecting American taxpayers from waste, fraud and abuse, it is essential that you examine the Department of Defense and money wasted during unnecessary wars, Kucinich said in a Jan. 4 letter to Oversight and Government Reform Committee Chairman Darrell Issa, a California Republican.Kucinich has also taken to television to make his case for Defense Department cuts. He alleged outrageous abuses during a Jan. 6 interview with Fox News anchor Jon Scott.Listen, when you can have a Defense Department that can shrink wrap $10.8 billion in American money, load it on 175 pallets and put it on a, on a transport plane and ship it to Iraq where they pass out $100 bills and no one has any receipts, when you know that kind of waste is going on, . . . we have concerns in this country that we have to start taking care of, and it's important that we track the misspending that's going on through the Department of Defense so that we can keep that money for the things we need at home, Kucinich said.We thought it would be worth investigating Kucinichs claim that the Pentagon loaded billions of shrink-wrapped U.S. dollars onto transport planes and flew them to Iraq, where these $100 bills were dispensed out without receipts.Kucinich spokesman Nathan White said his boss claim stemmed from a February 2007 House Oversight Committee hearing conducted by the committees then-chairman, Henry Waxman of California, which examined massive shipments of U.S. currency to Iraq as part of the war effort.A transcript of that hearing indicates the money at issue consisted of nearly $12 billion in cash that the Federal Reserve (not the Defense Department) sent to Iraq on C-130 cargo planes, mainly in shrink-wrapped packages of $100 bills, between May 2003 and June 2004. The money wasnt U.S. tax dollars – it came from Iraqi oil sales that were put in a development fund for the Iraqi people. It was sent in cash because no banks or financial system existed in Iraq immediately after the U.S. occupation. Some of the money was used to stabilize the country by launching large public works programs to create jobs. Much of it was given to Iraqi ministries to pay the salaries and pensions of Iraqi civil servants who hadnt had a paycheck since before the war. Although the Iraqi ministries lacked good payroll records, former Coalition Provisional Authority Administrator Paul Bremer told the committee that delaying their payments until better records were available would have been demoralizing and unfair to millions of Iraqi families, and might well have exacerbated danger to the American soldiers on the ground.Under Saddam Hussein, the Iraqi government had been by far the countrys largest employer, providing about four out of five of all jobs, Bremer testified. But for several months, since before the war, millions of Iraqi families had not received money owed them for civil service, salaries or pensions.Special Inspector for Iraq Reconstruction Stuart Bowen, who was charged with auditing money sent to Iraq for reconstruction, told the committee that more should have been done to track how the money was spent. His auditors said nearly $9 billion was improperly accounted for. In a recent interview, he stressed that his findings didnt mean all that money was used improperly, although his office found cases of graft that totaled in the tens of millions of dollars. He said 44 people have been convicted of crimes uncovered by his office.There were weak controls that made the money susceptible to waste and abuse, said Bowen. The money was given to these interim Iraqi ministries who spent it and used it as they chose. The fact that it was Iraqi money didnt in any way diminish our duty to make sure we carried out our fiduciary responsibilities. It was not well managed and not well accounted for.Bowens office released an audit last year that found inadequate accounting for $8.7 billion of another $9.1 billion in subsequent shipments of Iraqi cash that the Defense Department sent to Iraq after January 2004. It found several cases of bribery, fraud and money laundering by U.S. officials that resulted in eight criminal convictions and $7.8 million in fines, forfeitures and restitution payments, the report said.Kucinichs spokesman did not respond to questions asking why Kucinich told Fox that $10.8 billion was at issue, when $12 billion was the amount discussed by Waxmans committee. Bowen said he wasnt familiar with any cases where $10.8 billion were shipped to Iraq on 175 pallets, as Kucinich claimed, though he applauded Kucinichs advocacy for effective Iraq oversight.He is one of the reasons why the Special Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction has been able to succeed in the last seven years of work, Bowen said of Kucinich. Pentagon spending may be a legitimate place to look for budget cuts, but money misspent from this source could not be used for the things we need at home.",0.5,0.7,0.8,0.6,0.1,0.5,0.4,0.7,0.6,Mostly False

We recently came across a Facebook page that posted a collection of heartbreaking images that purports to show scenes of different animals caught in the fires. Theres just one problem: Many of the images are not from the wildfires in Australia. Some are not even from a fire event. We fact-checked several of the photos in the post, including this viral photo of a tiger on fire that was taken in 2012 in Jakarta, Indonesia. It depicted a bonfire of taxidermy animals. The multi-photo post that included that image has been shared over 84,000 times since Jan. 4 and displays 29 photos showing animals surrounded by smoke or fire, with the caption, Huge wildfire in Australia has resulted in deaths of more than 480 milion animals. Hundred of rare koalas are also reported dead among them. Lets pray for Australia Source: University of sydney report #wildfire. The University of Sydney estimated on Jan. 3 that 480 million animals have been killed in the New South Wales bushfires since September 2019. The post containing this photo gallery was flagged as part of Facebooks efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) We were able to track down several of the photos using the reverse-image search tool, Tin Eye. Here are some that are included in the post with their original locations and dates. (Note to readers that many of these images are disturbing.) An image of a horse being pulled through a smoky field was taken by photographer Étienne Laurent on Oct. 30, 2019, in Simi Valley, California. Horses were being pulled by ranchers to evacuate a burning ranch as the Easy Fire spread. A photo of a deer standing near a burned residence shows the aftermath of the Camp Fire that tore through Paradise, California. The photo was taken on Nov. 10, 2018, by photographer Josh Edelson. (Another image of a deer in the post wasnt taken during a fire event and was found on Adobe Stock Images, titled Red Deer in morning Sun.) An image of a burned cat was also taken in Paradise, California, showing destruction from the Camp Fire. Photojournalist Jane Tyska took the photograph on Nov. 11, 2018. A photo of a group of burned sheep lying dead in a field was taken in Australia, but it was taken in January 2013 in a New South Wales field after bushfires swept through the area. We found that a few of the other photos were taken in Australia more recently, in September 2019, but several more date back multiple years. Though this viral post contains a smattering of images that are legitimately connected to the current wildfires devastating Australia, it appears an overwhelming number of those depicted here are not.",0.3,0.8,1.0,0.2,0.5,0.4,0.6,0.7,0.4,Mostly False

Final Rating: Mostly True  ",We are the only state in the country that state employees don't contribute [to their pensions].,"Gov.-elect Rick Scott is taking office next month with big plans to cut state spending.One idea Scott has suggested is to cut $1.4 billion in state pension costs by making government employees contribute to their own retirement. Scott brought up the issue during the campaign and again on Dec. 14, 2010, in a meeting with state legislators.What do you all think about employees contributing to the pension plan?'' Scott asked legislators about ways to shrink state spending. We are the only state in the country that state employees don't contribute'' to their pensions.Last year, according to the Sarasota Herald-Tribune, the state and local governments contributed nearly $3.4 billion to the retirement fund, the Florida Retirement System. Governments typically contribute between 9 and 10 percent of an employee's annual income towardretirement. Employees are required to contribute nothing.Is Florida the only state with a system like that?Not quite, according to a PolitiFact Florida review of the state retirement systems of all 50 states. But Scott isn't far off either.PolitiFact Florida individually researched the state retirement systems across the country, as well as consulted with Ron Snell, the director of state services for the National Conference of State Legislatures. Snell studies state pension and retirement systems.Most state retirement systems are based on a defined benefit plan -- a system where the state multiplies an employee's years of service bysalaryandby some percentage to arrive at a pension amount. To qualify, employees have to be vested into the system -- meaning they work for the state for a certain number of years, often five. They also must contribute some percentage of their pay to the overall pension fund. (In most states, individualcontributions don't fund the retirement, but go into the overallpension fund.)A few states, however, have begun to adopt more private-sector-like 401(k) plans where the employee voluntarily contributes to a retirement fund and the employer eithermatches a portion of the contributions, or contributes on their own.And some states offer voluntary, optional 401(k) plans on top of a government pension.With state revenue sources drying up, states have been moving away from 100 percent employer-funded pensions to plans where employees are required to contribute.Missouri, for instance, will start making employees hired after Jan. 1, 2011, contribute 4 percent of their pay to their retirement plan, said Christine Rackers at the Missouri State Employees' Retirement System. Virginia lawmakers this year passed legislation requiring new employees to contribute 5 percent of their pay to their retirement. Current employees are operating under old rules where they do not have to contribute, though Virginia has discussed making them pay, too.Wisconsin also passed legislation making workers pay toward thepensionfund -- though their contribution is as little as .2 percent.Where are governments still footing the entire bill?The largest chunk of state employees in Utah are not required to contribute to their retirement. But a small percentage do.In Tennessee, state employees and higher education employees are not asked to pay toward their retirement, said spokesman Blake Fontenay. But some local government employees and all K-12 teachers are required to contribute, Fontenay said. The state, back in 1981, discussed either having employees contribute toward their retirement or forgo a pay raise that year, Fontenay said. The government chose no raise.And in Michigan, employees aren't necessarily required to contribute to their retirement because they have a traditional 401(k) plan, said Kurt Weiss with the state's Department of Technology, Management and Budget. The state contributes the equivalent of 4 percent of an employee's salary into a 401(k) regardless of whether the employee contributes. The state will then match up to an additional 3 percent employee contribution.A few other states exempt certain, small classes of employees -- like public safety employees -- from having to contribute to their retirement. But in every case, the bulk of state employees are required to participate in the state retirement system through payroll deductions.Wisconsin government analysts crafted a good synopsis of the state retirement plans in 2009 as that state was pondering changes. Contribution requirements are listed on Page 22.A note: Our analysis isn't meant to say Florida's retirement plan is a better deal for state employees than employees in other state governments. It's entirely possible that other state employeesreceive better pensions than Florida workers, even after accounting for employee contributions. Our focus solely was on where employees are asked to contribute to their retirement. And as we previously pointed out, Florida has the lowest payroll expenditures per resident -- $38 -- in the country, according to the state Department of Management Services. The national average was $72 per resident.Which brings us back to Scott's statement. In a meeting with state legislators, Scott suggested the state might save money by requiring state employees to contribute to their own retirement. Specifically, he said, that Florida is the only state in the country where government workers are not required to help fund their retirement.Scott is largely on the mark.Florida will be the only state, starting Jan. 1, 2011, where no one in the state retirement system is asked to contribute toward their pension. Two states -- Virginia and Missouri -- recently switched their retirement system meaning new hires will have to pay toward their retirement, but not existing employees. Michigan doesn't force its employees to participate either, but that state has a more private-sector-like 401(k) program. And Tennessee and Utah still do not require many of their state employees to contribute toward retirement, although other employees in those states do.",0.8,0.5,1.0,0.7,0.0,0.2,0.3,1.0,0.6,Mostly True

Approximately 60,000 Canadians currently live undocumented in the USA, tweeted Bush, a Missouri Democrat, Sept. 23. You dont see the militarized presence, cops on horseback, and calls for a wall on that border. The issue has never been about immigration. Its about anti-Blackness and racism. Bushs criticism came as the Biden administration dealt with fallout from its handling of thousands of Haitian migrants who in September crossed the border illegally into Texas. Images and videos of Border Patrol agents pursuing the migrants prompted outcry from some within Bidens party, as did the administrations decision to expel thousands. For decades, the U.S. governments treatment of refugees has varied greatly depending on where they are from. An Associated Press analysis of asylum data, for example, found that from October 2018 through June 2021 Haitians were granted asylum at the lowest rate of any nationality. We wanted to know if Bush was right about the number of undocumented Canadians in the U.S. We found that her statistic is in the ballpark of some available data, but the data lacks precision. Bushs congressional office declined to comment since she tweeted from her personal account. Her campaign did not respond to our query. There is no exact science for calculating the size of the unauthorized population in the United States.We reached out to nonpartisan experts and found that while their estimates vary, they tend to be in the same ballpark. The Migration Policy Institute estimates that approximately 57,000 unauthorized immigrants from Canada resided in the United States as of 2018, accounting for less than 1% of the 11 million unauthorized immigrants in the country. Some of the largest pockets of unauthorized immigrants from Canada were in Los Angeles, the Boston area, Floridas Broward County, Arizonas Maricopa County, and Washington states King County, the Migration Policy Institute found. The Pew Research Center estimated that in 2017 there were about 80,000 unauthorized immigrants from Canada. That estimate had a margin of error of +/- 15,000, which puts it in the same ballpark as the Migration Policy Institute number. The number of unauthorized immigrants from Canada has been dropping steadily in recent years, said Jeffrey Passel, senior demographer at Pew. For unauthorized Canadians, a figure of 60,000 for today is roughly consistent with the findings of our research, Passel said. Robert Warren, a senior fellow at the Center for Migration Studies, estimated that in 2019 the undocumented Canadian population in the U.S. was 32,000. Warren is a former longtime demographer for the U.S. Census Bureau and the former Immigration and Naturalization Service. None of these estimates rely on post-COVID era data, so they do not reflect a snapshot of what has happened during a period when it has been more difficult to cross the U.S. border. The Department of Homeland Security releases annual reports on the number of foreign visitors who came to the U.S. legally, but stayed beyond the time period for which their admission had been authorized. These visitors are referred to as visa overstayers, although Canadians generally dont require a visa to visit the U.S. for a few months. Ravi Jain, a Toronto-based immigration lawyer who is also licensed to practice law in Massachusetts, told us that undocumented Canadians in the U.S. are often looking for work, some as models, actors and singers. When they get a gig, they stay. Sometimes they find a romantic partner in the U.S. and just just dont file the paperwork timely, too. The Homeland Security overstay report for 2019 showed out of about 10 million expected departures, there were about 84,000 suspected Canadian overstayers. The overstay estimates available could be inflated. To give a concrete exampleYou have a temporary visa that calls for you to leave the U.S. on Sept. 28 but you leave on Oct. 2. You will be counted as a suspected in-county overstay as of the end of the fiscal year (Sept. 30) even though you have left the country, Passel said. Bush tweeted that approximately 60,000 Canadians currently live undocumented in the USA. Its difficult to pinpoint a precise count of undocumented Canadians, but Bushs number is in the ballpark of data by experts including those at the Migration Policy Institute and the Pew Research Center.

Final Rating: Mostly True  ","Thirty years ago, the United States ranked sixth among advanced economies in the share of women in the workforce. You know where we are today? Twenty-three.","During a visit to Howell, Mich., President Joe Biden touted key agenda items under negotiation in Congress. One of the proposals he wants to see receive final Congressional approval is support for child care, which he said would benefit both children and their parents, including mothers who want to take jobs outside the home. How can we compete in the world if millions of American parents, especially moms, cant join the workforce because they cant afford the cost of child care or elder care? They have to stay home, Biden said in the Oct. 5 speech. He went on to say that the United States had fallen behind its industrialized peers in the percentage of women in the labor force. Thirty years ago, the United States ranked sixth among advanced economies in the share of women in the workforce, Biden said. You know where we are today? Twenty-three. Twenty-two countries have a higher percentage of their women in the workforce making a competitive wage than the United States. While our competitors are investing in the care economy, were standing still. Has the United States really fallen so far behind in womens participation in the labor force? Our research shows it has. We asked the White House for a source, and they pointed to data from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, a think tank that studies advanced industrialized nations. The data broadly supports how Biden characterized the shifts between 1990 and 2020. There are multiple ways to measure the phenomenon Biden addressed — notably, what age ranges are used. If you look at the labor force participation rate for all women at least 15 years of age, the United States ranked seventh in 1990, behind Denmark, Sweden, Estonia, Finland, Norway and Canada. But by 2020, the United States ranking had fallen to 17th. (Labor force participation rate refers to the percentage of a given group that is either employed or is actively seeking work.) An alternative statistic — the labor force participation rate for women in the prime working ages of 25 to 54 — shows an even steeper U.S. decline. In 1990, the United States ranked seventh, behind the same six countries. But by 2020, the U.S. had fallen to 31st. The White House used a slightly different version of the OECD data than we did, which accounts for the differences in the U.S. rankings. But multiple economists told us that the differences in rankings were minor, and that the trend line was much more important. Specifically, the U.S. percentage of women working basically stagnated over those 30 years, even as 13 nations leapfrogged the U.S. between 1990 and 2020: Belgium, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Israel, Japan, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Portugal, Spain, and the United Kingdom.  However you define it, I think the president is highlighting genuine trends, said Gary Burtless, an economist with the Brookings Institution. Historically, women in the U.S. gravitated to the labor force earlier than women in other countries did. Right after World War II, only about one-third of U.S. women were in the labor force, but by the late 1990s, that percentage had risen steeply, to the low-60% range. Since then, however, it has plateaued and even fallen modestly overall.  By the early 1990s, the United States ranked higher on this measurement than most of its economic peers. Since the 1990s, the downturn has been driven mostly by married women with a college degree, particularly those married to high-earning men, said Stefania Albanesi, an economist at the University of Pittsburgh. Albanesi said her research suggests that a rise in earnings of college-educated men, particularly those at the top of the income distribution, has reduced the pressure for married women to take paying work outside the home. As the U.S. rate began to fall, other nations caught up. Several factors drove these international shifts, economists say. One is that women in other countries have belatedly made gains in educational attainment, giving them a boost in the labor market. But perhaps the biggest difference comes from the lack of social policies in the United States that enable women with children to take jobs. The policies that are common in other industrialized countries but not in the U.S. include publicly provided child care services, an entitlement to paid parental leave, laws giving workers the right to demand a change to a part-time work schedule without exception and without being discriminated against, said Mihaela Pintea, an economist at Florida International University. The upshot of the lack of such policies in the U.S. is that its costly or burdensome for women with kids to remain in the workforce after they have a child, Burtless said. Claudia Goldin, a Harvard University economist, cautioned that its tricky to make cross-national comparisons on labor-force participation. Perhaps the biggest factor complicating Bidens comparison is that countries define part-time work differently. Generally speaking, when looking only at participation among women who work full-time hours, the U.S. ranks higher in international comparisons, Goldin said. If you did this comparison just for full-time work, wed be up there, she said. If you weighted by hours, wed be up there. Pintea added that, despite grim statistics like those cited by Biden, U.S. women who are working may still be better positioned in some ways. Effectively, the U.S. labor market environment pushes women to either skip working entirely or take a full-time job, rather than finding a middle ground. In a lot of other countries, women might work part-time as opposed to full time and may be less likely to be promoted into managerial positions, or may have lower wages than their male counterparts because of their career path, she said. Biden said, Thirty years ago, the United States ranked sixth among advanced economies in the share of women in the workforce. You know where we are today? Twenty-three. The specific rankings vary a bit depending on what measure one uses, though by one measurement, the U.S. position is even worse than Biden said. The general conclusion is the same: The United States used to rank near the top of the pack of industrialized countries in womens participation in the labor force, but over the past 30 years, many other countries have leapfrogged the U.S. in that measurement, as the rate in the U.S. stagnated or even fell. Economists say the U.S. rate has been lagging for several reasons, including a lack of government policies encouraging child care and paid leave and other countries catching up to the United States earlier gains in womens educational attainment.",0.8,0.2,1.0,0.7,0.1,0.2,0.5,1.0,0.6,Mostly True

Final Rating: Mostly True  ",House Democrats have a two-to-one advantage money-wise against House Republicans.,"On the Aug. 1, 2010, edition of ABC's This Week with Christiane Amanpour, the show's host asked House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., how she felt when President Barack Obama's spokesman, Robert Gibbs, suggested a few weeks earlier that the Democrats could lose their House majority in the fall elections. Pelosi exuded confidence. You know what, I'm speaker of the House, Pelosi said. I have a great chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, Chris Van Hollen. We have a solid plan of messaging and mobilizing at the grassroots level and management of our campaigns. And we have a two-to-one advantage money-wise. So we feel very confident about where we are, whether that's well known to that gentleman or not. We thought the part of Pelosi's comment worth checking was that House Democrats have a two-to-one advantage money-wise against House Republicans. Because Pelosi mentioned the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee just two sentences earlier, we began by looking at the money statistics for the DCCC and the parallel GOP organization, the National Republican Congressional Committee. Both groups work to elect members of their party to House seats. According to the Center for Responsive Politics, a Washington-based group that tracks money in politics, the DCCC had $33,783,724 in the bank through Aug. 3, 2010, compared to $17,039,525 for the NRCC, and neither committee had any debt. That works out almost exactly to a ratio of two-to-one -- just as Pelosi said. But while the DCCC/NRCC ratio for cash on hand is probably the best statistic to use, it isn't the only one. So we decided to look at a handful of others for comparison. -- The ratio of money raised for the DCCC and NRCC -- not just what's left in the bank. The DCCC has raised $93,706,323 during the 2009-2010 campaign cycle, compared to $75,531,984 for the NRCC. That's a 1.24 to 1 ratio -- a much more even split than cash on hand. -- Money totals raised and held by House candidates themselves, rather than by the DCCC or the NRCC. When you look at money raised by the candidates themselves, the Republicans have actually raised slightly more than the Democrats as of Aug. 3, 2010 -- $355,067,654 to $351,238,367. Meanwhile, Democrats running for the House have $245,223,757 in the bank, compared to $173,422,985 for Republican candidates. That's a ratio of about 1.4 to 1. Since the Republicans have more candidates running for the House, we also decided to adjust these numbers to reflect amounts raised and held per candidate. The Democrats lead in total money raised per House candidate, $589,326 to $323,670 -- a 1.82 to 1 ratio. They lead by an even larger ratio in cash on hand per House candidate -- $411,000 to $158,000, or 2.6 to 1. -- Independent expenditures. Independent expenditures are dollars spent on campaigning by sources other than the candidates' own campaign treasuries. Through July 11, 2010, $19,017,868 was spent independently either for Democratic candidates or against Republican candidates, compared to $7,776,690 spent in support of Republicans or against Democrats. That's a ratio of about 2.4 to 1 favoring Democratic candidates. So let's sum up. When comparing the DCCC and the NRCC in cash on hand, Pelosi is on target when she says that there's a two-to-one Democratic advantage. But using four other measures, the Democrats have a smaller lead, including one case in which the Republicans narrowly lead. Using two other measures, the Democrats have a lead of greater than two to one. Of course, these statistics can change before Election Day, and it's not especially surprising that the Democrats lead the Republicans in fundraising -- being the incumbent party in power. Either way, we think the single best statistic to use is the one Pelosi cited correctly, so we'll rate her comment Mostly True.",1.0,0.0,1.0,0.8,0.0,0.0,0.5,1.0,1.0,Mostly True

Final Rating: Mostly True  ",57% of the jobs created in Austin from 2009 to 2013 do not pay families a living wage.,"Austin isnt as affordable as it needs to be, mayoral aspirant Steve Adler says on his campaign website, adding: Our children cannot afford to live in the Austin where they grew up when they graduate and leave home. Even during a time of historic job growth, 57% of the jobs created from 2009 to 2013 do not pay families a living wage. We wondered about that percentage. By email, Adlers campaign manager, Jim Wick, said Adler saw the figure in an April 26, 2014, Austin American-Statesman news analysis by Dan Zehr citing data compiled by Idaho-based Economic Modeling Specialists International, which analyzes workforce-related data. That story said that while the Austin metro area had gained thousands of jobs in recent years, inflation-adjusted earnings had fallen. Then came the declaration that drew Adlers attention, which didnt speak generally to families or to jobs in Austin alone. From 2009 to 2013, the article said, almost 57 percent of the newly created jobs in the area paid less than the living wage for a single parent with one child ($19.56 per hour), according to data from EMSI and the oft-cited living wage calculator created by researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. That living-wage figure, identical for Travis and Williamson counties, appears on web pages overseen by Amy Glasmeier, an MIT professor of economic geography and regional planning. According to the entries, the living wage is the hourly rate that an individual must earn to support their family, if they are the sole provider and are working full-time (2,080 hours per year). To our inquiry, Zehr provided a spreadsheet he built based on increases or decreases in jobs across more than 730 professions in the Austin-Round Rock Metropolitan Statistical Area, also showing the estimated median hourly wage for each of the professions. By email, EMSI spokesman Joshua Wright said its median hourly wage data came from the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics and that information was benchmarked to the firms own industry-by-industry data drawn from agencies like the BLS and U.S. Census Bureau. By our calculation, some 53,315 of the 92,620 net jobs added in the Austin area from 2009 to 2013, or 58 percent, had a median hourly wage less than the living wage for a single parent with one child. These lower-wage jobs encompassed 394 types of jobs including positions in oil, gas and mining as well as loan interviewers and clerks, pest control workers, skin-care specialists and medical secretaries, according to the spreadsheet. In reviewing these details, we also wondered if the outcomes for Austin workers were as dire as Adler said. For instance, the MIT website presents lower living wages including, for Travis and Williamson counties, $18.51 an hour for two adults and a child; $14.88 for two adults only; and $9.43 for one adult alone. If you focus on earnings at a lower living wage, in turn, youre going to conclude more workers fared better. According to the spreadsheet, for instance, 40,560 of the 92,620 net jobs gained from 2009 to 2013, or 44 percent, had median hourly wages less than $14.88; 15,099 of the net jobs gained, 16 percent, had median hourly wages less than $9.43. It also occurred to us the median wage might not be a perfect way to gauge who exactly is earning enough to get by. That is, the median wage in each occupation is the boundary between the highest paid 50 percent and the lowest paid 50 percent of workers. It stands to reason, then, that some workers in the 57 percent still made more than the living wage for a single parent with a child. But its also so that some of the other 43 percent made less than the same living wage.  The limits of public wage data evidently make it difficult to calculate a precise percentage. Next, for an independent look at this claim, we turned to Cynthia Osborne, a University of Texas associate professor and director of the Child and Family Research Partnership at the Lyndon B. Johnson School of Public Affairs. By email, Osborne told us the 57 percent figure might be right, but shed need more information -- particularly the variations in wages around each median -- to reach a conclusion. EMSIs Wright told us he didnt have that type of information, but could share the wages for each occupation at specific points along the wage curve. Daniel Dillon, a research associate for the partnership, later said three interpolations drawing on this added detail basically confirmed about 57 percent of the jobs added in the Austin area didnt pay the living wage for an adult with one child. Our ruling Adler said: 57% of the jobs created from 2009 to 2013 do not pay families a living wage. To be precise, thats the estimated share of net jobs added in the multi-county Austin area (not Austin alone) pegged as having median wages less than the living wage for an adult with one child. Families vary in size, though, as do related living wages. MOSTLY TRUE – The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information.

Final Rating: Mostly True  ","The President wants to cut 3 MILLION people from SNAP, including children, seniors and veterans.","Over Thanksgiving week, a North Carolina Democrat drew attention to a Trump Administration proposal that would cut the number of people who receive public funding for food. U.S. Rep. Alma Adams, a Democrat representing the Charlotte area, tweeted on Nov. 26 about the administrations proposal for cuts to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, known as SNAP. The President wants to cut 3 MILLION people from #SNAP, including children, seniors and veterans, Adams tweeted. This is unacceptable. SNAP is the first line of defense against hunger and I stand with @TheBlackCaucus to protect Americas most vulnerable: our children. #1MillionKids. Is it true that the Trump administration is proposing to cut 3 million people from the SNAP program? Does that proposal include children, seniors and veterans? There are multiple proposed changes to the SNAP program, The SNAP program provides nutritional assistance to people who are low-income or disabled. Adams referred to proposed changes to categorical eligibility. And, as it turns out, the Adams claim is mostly on-point. 3 million The proposed change to categorical eligibility rules would affect 3.1 million people currently receiving those benefits, according to the USDAs own estimates. SNAP currently allows states to grant categorical eligibility to people who are already on other social programs. The USDA believes some those people wouldnt qualify otherwise. As a result, some households can qualify when they would not under regular programs rules, the department wrote in a fact sheet. The Trump administration sees this change as closing a loophole allowing some to abuse a program thats intended to be a temporary safety net, NPR reported. Whos affected? We reached out to the USDAs Food and Nutrition Service department for insight on how many SNAP participants might be affected by the proposed change. An estimated 673,000 households with seniors and 597,000 households with children are projected to lose benefits, the USDAs communications office told us in an email. As for military veterans, the number is a little less clear. We reached out to the USDA and other groups that track SNAP beneficiaries, but struggled to find a specific number of veterans that might be affected. Veterans not tracked USDA does not have data to determine the specific impacts of the rule on households with veterans, as veteran status does not impact eligibility and therefore is not captured in the caseload data used to analyze the rule, the USDA told us. But its possible veterans would be affected. About 40 million people participate in the SNAP program. About 1.4 million veterans live in participating SNAP households, according to a 2018 study by the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. The center analyzed data provided by the U.S. Census Bureau and estimated SNAP is currently assisting 55,000 veterans in North Carolina. Rebecca Vallas, a senior fellow at the left-leaning Center for American Progress, believes its more than fair to conclude veterans would be affected. She believes Adams is on strong footing. Our ruling Adams said President Trump wants to cut 3 million people from SNAP, including children, seniors and veterans. Its true that his administrations proposal would affect 3 million people, including children and seniors. Veterans also receive SNAP benefits, but we dont know how many veterans would be directly affected. Given that uncertainty, we believe Adams statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information.",0.8,0.6,1.0,0.7,0.5,0.4,0.3,1.0,0.5,Mostly True

Final Rating: True  ","North Korea has a substantial standing army, one of the largest, certainly the largest per capita, in the world.","In recent weeks, the North Korean government has made numerous increasingly provocative statements threatening South Korea and the United States, at one point warning South Korea that our retaliatory action will start without any notice from now.  As the rhetoric was escalating, U.S. Sen. Jack Reed, a Rhode Island Democrat, spoke of North Koreas military capabilities during an appearance on WJAR Channel 10s 10 News Conference. Reed was asked about North Koreas recent moves and generally about what threat it could pose to the United States. Reed said that there is concern that, in five or more years, North Korea could increase its capability to launch nuclear missiles that travel longer ranges. They have a substantial standing army, one of the largest, certainly the largest per capita, in the world, he said of their conventional, non-nuclear, military. We wanted to know whether North Korea -- officially the Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea -- really has such a large force, based on the best-known information. The caveat of best-known is underscored by a recent New York Times news analysis, which reported on the difficulties the United States faces getting accurate intelligence about the country and raised questions about the accuracy of information about things such as nuclear weapons. We contacted Chip Unruh, Reeds spokesman, who e-mailed links to several documents. One is a U.S. Department of Defense report to Congress on North Korea that says that countrys total military -- army, air and naval capabilities -- ranks in personnel numbers as the fourth largest military in the world. It fields primarily legacy equipment, the report states, meaning hardware based on designs of the Soviet Union and China, dating back to the 1950s, 60s and 70s, though a few systems are based on modern technology. According to the Department of Defense report, at about 950,000, the ground forces comprise the vast majority of North Koreas military. The report estimates that country has some 60,000 naval personnel and 92,000 air force personnel -- a total of about 1.1 million. Several other sources provided by Unruh, including a March 28, 2012, statement before the House Armed Services Committee by Gen. James D. Thurman, commander of the United States-South Korea combined forces, supported the statement that North Korea has the fourth largest military in terms of sheer manpower, behind China, the United States and India. The 2012 U.S. Department of States Bureau of East Asian and Pacific Affairs fact sheet said the estimated active-duty military force in North Korea is as many as 1.2 million personnel. Unruh also supplied a link to a short 2011 article and graphic in The Economist magazine. Using data from 161 countries for which such information was available, according to the magazine, the graphic said China had the largest active military in number of personnel -- more than 2.25 million -- while the United States was second with upward of 1.5 million active-duty personnel. India was third in manpower. The Economist placed North Korea fourth in overall personnel at about 1.2 million, but the Economist also noted that, if looked at per population, North Korea was, by far, the most heavily militarized of all, saying there were 49 military personnel for every 1,000 North Koreans -- a ratio greater than that of any other nation. China has a population estimated at 1.3 billion people, with 1.7 military personnel for every 1,000 Chinese, and the United States has a population estimated at more than 316 million, with 5.5 military personnel per 1,000. We checked the CIAs latest estimate, for July 2013, which put North Koreas population at about 24.7 million people. Finally, we contacted the International Institute for Strategic Studies, which issues an annual report The Military Balance on nations military capabilities. Mark Fitzpatrick, director of the institutes nonproliferation and disarmament program, e-mailed that Reeds statement sounds correct to me but suggested checking the militaries of some smaller nations such as Israel. The Economist reported that Israel had 23 military personnel per 1,000 population. Of course, sheer manpower numbers arent necessarily a good measure of a nations military capability. And analysts often assert that much of North Koreas technology and hardware is outdated or obsolete. But thats beyond the scope of our analysis. Our ruling U.S. Sen. Jack Reed, D-R.I., said, of North Korea: They have a substantial standing army, one of the largest, certainly the largest per capita, in the world. Numerous publicly available documents support his claim.",1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,True

Final Rating: True  ","Says since he took office, the City of Milwaukee has seen the creation of 7,000 new affordable housing units.","Seeking his fifth term as mayor, Tom Barrett has focused on bringing more jobs and housing to Milwaukee, among other issues. On the campaign trail, and again in his Feb. 10. 2020 State of the City address, Barrett has touted his 10,000 Homes Initiative, announced in 2018, which aims to increase affordable housing availability in the city by building or improving 10,000 housing units within 10 years. That reminded us of a claim from his Nov. 20, 2019 campaign launch we wanted to check. I am more optimistic now than I have ever been about the future of our city, Barrett said during that speech, before touting various accomplishments. Its about building for the future of this city. Weve done so by creating homes, 7,000 homes. The issue of housing in Milwaukee has also entered the mayoral race. Primary opponents, including state Sen. Lena Taylor, D-Milwaukee, have criticized Barretts record on housing. Is Barrett, first elected in April 2004, correct that 7,000 homes have been created since he took office? Lets take a look. When asked for the evidence to back up the claim, Barretts staff directed PolitiFact Wisconsin to a Department of City Development (DCD) report. The report shows that as of October 2019, a total of 7,261 affordable housing units had been developed since Barrett took office in 2004. Of those, 690 were downtown and 6,571 were outside downtown. All are rental units. The majority are apartments located in both newly-constructed buildings and existing buildings, including offices, manufacturing space, warehouses and vacant schools that have been redeveloped into apartments, said Martha Brown, deputy DCD commissioner, in an email. The total also includes several hundred new single-family homes, and both one- and two-family vacant houses that have been completely rehabilitated and made available as affordable rental housing. Milwaukee housing changes Map shows the change in the number of residential properties in each aldermanic district from 2004 to 2019. Design: Eric Litke, Milwaukee Journal SentinelSource: Wisconsin Elections Commission  According to Brown, the developments were financed with federal Low Income Housing Tax Credits allocated by the Wisconsin Housing and Economic Development Authority. Under the program units are deemed affordable based on a variety of factors, but cant go to anyone making more than 60% of the median income for the area. For a family of four, the cut-off would be $49,380. In many cases, the apartments are earmarked for those making an even smaller percentage of the median income. Brown also noted that Habitat for Humanity develops affordable housing for homeownership and those units were not included in DCDs count. Brian Sonderman, executive director of Habitat for Humanity Milwaukee, said since 1984 the group has built or rehabbed 620 single-family homes and has assisted more than 700 additional families through affordable home repair and loan assistance. We believe affordable homeownership is key to helping local families build strength, stability and independence, Sonderman said in an email. Sonderman said the city has helped the process with acquisition as well as funding. For instance, the city may sell vacant lots to the group for $1 each. Habitat also receives federal grant money allocated through the city. So, by the numbers, Barrett is on target. Is there anything else to consider? Residential vs. apartments According to the city Assessors Office, the count of residential properties as reported on the citys 2004 Statement of Assessment (the year Barrett was elected) was 135,352. The number from 2019 showed 137,098 parcels. But that figure accounts for only residential housing and condos, not the apartments that are the focus of the tax credit program. In August 2019, Mike Ruzicka, president of the Greater Milwaukee Association of Realtors, sent a letter to community leaders in Milwaukee, Ozaukee, Washington and Waukesha counties urging officials to think twice before approving more apartment projects. Greater Milwaukee is following a trend seen across the country, he wrote. Numerous multifamily units are being built at the expense of owner-occupied condominium and single-family units. Indeed, at the same time the city has been adding affordable housing units, it has been busy bulldozing derelict ones. Between April 1, 2004 and Oct. 31, 2019, some 3,542 units were razed by the city, and 3,123 razed privately, for a total of 6,665 units razed, according to the city Department of Neighborhood Services. These are not places where people live; and in many instances, removal of these blighted structures spurs additional neighborhood revitalization and growth, said Christina Klose, a department spokeswoman. Our ruling Barrett said since he took office, the city has seen the creation of 7,000 new affordable housing units. The numbers back him up: Through affordable housing programs, 7,261 units have been created since Barrett took office.",1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,True

Final Rating: True  ","Says when he was governor,we expanded participation in Virginia in early childhood programs by nearly 40 percent.","Democratic Senate hopeful Tim Kaine says a key step in building a workforce trained for the future is to ensure all children are prepared to enter kindergarten. And he offers his record as governor as proof of his commitment to that goal.The research clearly demonstrates high-quality early childhood opportunities help children succeed, he wrote in a paper laying out his economic policies. Thats why we expanded participation in Virginia in early childhood programs by nearly 40 percent...We checked whether Virginias early childhood programs really did grow by 40 percent during Kaines term as governor from 2006 to 2010.During his gubernatorial campaign, Kaine proposed making Virginias pre-kindergarten program available to all 4-year-olds -- not just those from families living close to the poverty line. The universal access was estimated to cost $300 million a year.Once in office, Kaine scaled back that ambition in the face of a recession that eroded state revenues. But he did seek increases preschool programs every year during his term.Budget records show he proposed an extra $4.6 million for the 2007-08 fiscal year to add 1,250 children to the program. In his full biennial budget, which covered 2008 through 2010, Kaine sought $56 million in additional funding, according to reports. The request was pared to $40 million, then $22 million, as lawmakers sought to cope with the recession.Over the course of Kaines term, the Virginia Preschool Initiative saw a steady rise to its annual budget from $46.3 to $58.6 million. (That trend has continued into the recently approved budget, which provided $68.2 million for 2013 and $68.5 million for 2014.)Virginia Preschool Initiative teaches social and learning skills to 4-year-olds who will become eligible for free or reduced lunch programs when they enter public schools. The pre-K program is open to at-risk children who live above the poverty line. Children below that line qualify for the federal Head Start program.In the 2005-06 school year, when Kaine took office, 11,343 children were enrolled in Virginias preschool initiative. By the time his term ended, in the 2009-10 school year, the program had 15,901 children. The increase is 40.2 percent.Our rulingKaine claimed that he was part of expanding participation in early childhood programs in Virginia by nearly 40 percent.

Final Rating: True  ",More than half of Virginias school buildings are older than 50 years.,"State Sen. Jennifer McClellan, D-Richmond, is leading a bipartisan effort this winter to raise money to repair and replace Virginias aging school buildings. Studies have shown more than half of Virginias school buildings are older than 50 years, she and Sen. Bill Stanley, R-Franklin, wrote in a Feb. 15 guest column published in The Roanoke Times. We wondered whether the figure is correct, particularly in the wake of a Feb. 11 fire that gutted Richmonds 111-year-old William Fox Elementary School. An advisor to McClellan pointed us to a June 2021 report the Virginia Department of Education gave to a legislative commission studying the conditions of the states school buildings. More than half of all school buildings are greater than 50 years old, the report said, using almost the same words as the guest column. The report surveyed 2,005 school buildings across the state and found 1,017 of them - or 52% - were at least 50 years old as of June 2021. The median, or middle, age was 52. Here are percentages of local schools at least 50 years old: Chesterfield, 38%; Hanover, 48%; Henrico, 64%; Richmond, 72%. McClellan says the state and localities are falling behind on renovating and replacing old schools and, without change, the problem will worsen. Shes proposed a number of bills that would raise more money for modernization. The measures include: Allowing all localities in Virginia to impose a 1% increase in their sales tax, subject to voter approval, for school construction or renovation. Only nine localities are now granted that option; Letting local school systems set aside operating budget surpluses for school construction; Lowering the interest rates on state loans to localities for school construction and upgrades; and Expanding state aid for school building projects. Her bills easily passed in the Democratic-led Senate with bipartisan support. But identical measures have been killed in the Appropriations Committee of the Republican-led House. Its unclear whether there will be any movement in the House, where the majority has been focused on Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkins agenda of cutting taxes. We should finally note that problems with aging school buildings are not confined to Virginia. In June 2020, the U.S. Government and Accountability Office reported that about half of the nations public school districts need to replace multiple building systems or features. The average age of U.S. school buildings was 44 in 2013, according to the most recent survey by the National Center for Education Statistics. McClellan writes, More than half of Virginias school buildings are older than 50 years. State Department of Education records show 52% of Virginia schools had crossed the half-century mark in June 2021. ",1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,True

Final Rating: True  ","Says, Since 1994 when VAWA was first passed, incidents of domestic violence have dropped more than 50 percent.","Violence - or the potential for violence - is everywhere. Its the reason we have police and laws, jails and federal programs to study the causes and suggest responses.Its the reason, too, that Congress passes laws to address crime in all its facets. One of those is the Violence Against Women Act, which is intended to protect women from domestic abuse and violence. It provides federal dollars for an array of programs to achieve that goal. Oregon, for example, collected $9.4 million in 2012 for programs to protect women from violence.The law was first passed in 1994 and easily renewed in 2000 and 2005 by lopsided majorities. But it was allowed to lapse in 2011 after a partisan Congress couldnt reach agreement. (Partisanship in Congress? Shocking, we know.)Now its back and in an effort to build momentum and the votes to renew it, supporters like Sen. Jeff Merkley, D-Ore., have been talking about the laws benefits.Heres what Merkley said Feb. 7 during a conference call with reporters: Since 1994 when VAWA was first passed, incidents of domestic violence have dropped more than 50 percent.That seems to be a pretty strong selling point and as the bill moves toward a final vote in the Senate its something that will be repeated and emphasized during debate.But is it true?First, we need a quick fly-by of the law and what it provides. The law, known by the shorthand VAWA, first passed in 1994 and was written by then senator and now Vice President Joe Biden.It acknowledged domestic violence and sexual assault as crimes, and provided federal resources to encourage community-coordinated responses to combating violence. When it was re-authorized in 2000 lawmakers expanded the definition of crime to include dating violence and stalking. Its subsequent reauthorization in 2005 created new programs to meet the emerging needs of communities working to prevent violence.Until it expired in 2011, the law was expansive and reached into every corner of the country. (Some funding continued into 2012.) Among other things, it provided grants to states and local law enforcement to beef up enforcement as well as money to prosecutors to focus on gender-based crime. Included in the array of programs and assistance, VAWA provided money for direct services for victims of sexual assault and for things like transitional housing and legal assistance.According to Merkley, all those programs made a difference.Which brings us back to his claim that since it was first enacted domestic violence has fallen 50 percent.Another fortunate development when it comes to crime is that governments at all levels but especially the federal government go to great lengths to quantify, parse and sub-total crime. Data abounds.Its also unambiguous.From 1994 to 2010, the overall rate of intimate partner violence in the United States declined by 64 percent, from 9.8 victimizations per 1,000 persons age 12 or older to 3.6 per 1,000, the U.S. Justice Departments Bureau of Justice Statistics reported in November 2012.The report notes that over that same period 4 in 5 victims of intimate partner violence were female.A report by the National Network to End Domestic Violence, an interest group focusing on the issue, comes to a similar conclusion.The rate of nonfatal intimate partner violence against women has decreased by 63 percent and the number of women killed by an intimate partner has decreased 24 percent, between 1994 and 2010.The group connects the numbers directly to the VAWA, saying the law has changed the way federal, tribal, state and local entities respond to domestic violence, sexual assault, dating violence and stalking.Surveys by the American Bar Association and other independent groups had similar findings.Thats a lot of scholarship and paper, sponsored, collected and analyzed by federal and independent researchers. And while the results dont perfectly align, all agree that the incidence of domestic abuse has dropped by more than 50 percent since the Violence Against Women Act was passed in 1994. You can quibble about the minor differences but not the accuracy of Merkleys statement.",1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,True

Final Rating: True  ",Says he is the only candidate in the race for Clackamas County Chair who will refuse to join the Public Employees Retirement System.,"Wilsonville businessman John Ludlow is in a four-way race for Clackamas County Commission Chair in next week's election. He says that he is the only candidate in the race who will refuse to join the Public Employees Retirement System.Is he the only candidate in the race to make such a promise? Perhaps just as important a question: Are elected officials even able to decline joining the retirement system?The Public Employees Retirement System is a hot-button issue with critics who claim it eats way too much money, hurting taxpayers to benefit public employees. The retirement program is open to participating employers, from the state of Oregon to school districts and cities.We turned to Paul Cleary, the retirement system's executive director. He pointed to Oregon Revised Statutes 238A.100 (2):  A person who is elected or appointed to an office with a fixed term ...may elect not to become a member of the pension program by giving the Public Employees Retirement Board written notice not later than 30 days after taking office. The trick here, says Cleary, is that for a person to decline membership, that person cannot have been a PERS member, ever. Ludlow is a former Wilsonville city councilor and served as Wilsonvilles mayor from 1989 to 1991, but received no retirement benefits from his time in public office.Ludlow, 63, says he has never been a member of PERS, and the Public Employees Retirement System confirms he is not a member.The other Clackamas County commission chair candidates are members of the Public Employees Retirement System. They are county Chairwoman Charlotte Lehan, county Commissioner Paul Savas, and state Rep. Dave Hunt. They cannot opt out. Savas said he never knew he could decline to join.

Final Rating: True  ",Says that Tennessee law requires that schools receive half of proceeds -- $31 million per year -- from a half-cent increase in the Shelby County sales tax.,"Education funding issues often provoke emotional arguments, and a measure to increase the local option sales tax in Shelby County by a half cent has led to accusations that an education-advocacy group is trying to manipulate voter sensibilities with misleading claims about the benefits for school-children.We've covered some education funding issues before, like the claim that the education burden on Tennessee and Shelby County taxpayers is among the lowest in the nation (Mostly True) and the assertion that local governments have not increased spending on schools over six budget cycles (True).In this case, Stand For Children is leading the campaign to persuade voters in Memphis and unincorporated Shelby County to raise the local option sales tax levied by the county from the current 2.25 percent to 2.75 percent (the state sales tax rate is 7.0). The overarching message on expensive, glossy mailers -- the future of the adorable children smiling in photos will be brighter if voters approve the half-cent sales tax increase.Stand is allied with a bi-partisan coalition of supporters, including Memphis Mayor A C Wharton and most of the Memphis City Council, Shelby County Commission chairman Mike Ritz, Memphis Congressman Steve Cohen and the majority of the unified Shelby County Board of Education. They argue the increase is necessary to help fund the $57 million shortfall that Shelby County's schools merger Transition Planning Commission says will occur if all their schools consolidation recommendations are approved by the unified county school board.Opponents, including Shelby County Mayor Mark Luttrell and Memphis City Councilman Jim Strickland, contend that until a clearer picture is available for the exact budget needs of the consolidating school systems in Memphis and Shelby County, it is premature to levy an additional tax.Stand is making a slew of claims, some of which elude the Truth-O-Meter process because they involve opinions, hypotheticals and interpretations about the will of elected officials. Small change can make a big difference for all of our kids reads one line, and another claims the revenue will make our schools better. Both are clearly opinions.Stand also says the money will allow for expansion of pre-kindergarten and training for teachers, while also possibly helping expand hours at libraries and community centers. Strickland especially objects to what he calls the pre-K promise, and indeed it remains to be seen whether the school board will follow through on the recommendations of the Transition Planning Commission and its own committees and staff to expand pre-K. There are budget and logistical issues that could delay or derail the plan to offer pre-K to all children who need it.Stand in some cases has adjusted, for instance, by qualifying its language on pre-K. But on one issue it has only raised the volume -- that whatever else is argued about increasing the county sales tax, $31 million is guaranteed to flow to the county's schools because state law requires half of the proceeds of a local option sales tax to be spent on schools.That's the claim we are examining here.When we contacted Stand, its Memphis-based state director, Kenya Bradshaw, almost immediately emailed back a copy of Tennessee Code Annotated 67-6-712, Distribution of revenue under the The 1963 Local Option Revenue Act.Bradshaw was a member of the county Transition Planning Commission that made pre-K for all who need it one of its highest priorities, and she carries around an actual copy of the statute.It deals with the local option sales tax and very plainly states that one-half (1/2) of the proceeds shall be expended and distributed in the same manner as the county property tax for school purposes is expended and distributed.It also says that the the proceeds can be pledged to the punctual payment of principal of and interest on bonds, notes or other evidence of indebtedness but doing so requires the approval of the local school board.Estimates of the revenue expected to be raised from that county sales tax increase have run between $60 million and $62 million -- it depends in part on projections of future economic activity. So $30-31 million per year would, in fact, be guaranteed for schools. The half that does not go to schools is returned to the municipalities where they were collected, and of that non-schools portion $23 million is expected to flow to Memphis.One core issue is that approval of the countywide increase would trump the votes in August referendums by suburban municipalities to apply a half-cent local option sales tax as a way to raise revenue to fund municipal school districts they hope to operate.Opposition to the increase in some suburban municipalities is therefore fierce, because it would mean lower overall revenue than was expected for some municipal school districts. Some opponents argue that the vote is basically an anti-suburban municipal schools money grab by Memphis interests. Residents in those suburbs do not get a vote because they already have authorized sales tax increases for their towns.Another argument by proponents is that a vote against the half-cent sales tax increase is essentially a vote for a property-tax increase to fund the expected budget gap created because of schools consolidation.Our rulingThere is clearly much for voters to consider on the referendum to increase by a half-cent the county's sales tax rate, and the contentiousness related to the Shelby County's reorganization of public schools has created some confusion for voters.On one of the most crucial issues, Stand For Children claims half the proceeds from the local option sales tax must go to schools. The statute is definitive and the claim is True.",1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,True

Final Rating: True  ",Too many tattoos on visible body parts keepsome applicants out of the military.,"Failing test scores aren'tthe only problem that has caused the military to reject applicants, says former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush. Another problemis, well, more colorful: tattoos. While talking about his push to improve public education at the Wall Street Journal CEO Council event Dec. 1, Bush pointed to problems the military has finding qualified applicants. Bush mentioned a video in which a military official talked about the challenge: In the video beforehand, Gen. Dempsey talked about a 25 percent pass rate. Now thats not just because of the test, thats also because of obesity, and too many tattoos, to be honest with you, on visible body parts for people that are trying to get into the military. But the pass rate for a high-school-level test to join the military is about 35 percent, I think, or 40 percent at best. These are abysmal numbers. PolitiFact has previously fact-checked claims about whether obesity and physical fitness have kept applicants out of the military (both true).But we hadnt explored the role of tattoos in filling the military ranks. We couldnt resist taking a look. Tattoo policies Each branch of the service sets their own rules about tattoos, but it was the Armys policy that has drawn the most ink recentlyfrom the media. In March 2014, the Army overhauled its appearance policy, which includes more than two pages of detailed rules about tattoo, branding and body mutilation. This led to a rush to get tattedso soldiers could be grandfathered in under the new rules. The Army has a detailed procedure for grandfathering that directs unit commanders to document each tattoo in an official memorandum. The Armys policy states that tattoos, regardless of subject matter, are prohibited on certain areas of the body, including the wrists, hands and fingers, as well as the head, face, and neck, defined as anything above the t-shirt neck line to include on/inside the eyelids, mouth, and ears. Soldiers may have no more than four visible tattoos below the elbow (to the wrist bone) or below the knee, the policy says. So far under the new policy, 2,919 applicants could not process due to tattoos,said Brian Lepley, an Army recruiting spokesman. Those 2,919 are the ones whose tattoos were so egregious it was highly unlikely a waiver could get through, or the applicant chose not to try a waiver, he said. In the Army, 193 tattoo waivers for applicants have been granted, while one was rejected and four are pending. Lepley told us that tattoos are not the No. 1 disqualifier. Medical conditions, drug use, misconduct or some combination of those issues disqualify more applicants. News reports around the country indicate the tattoopolicy is limiting applicants, though. Right now, with the new tattoo policy in effect, we currently turn away one in every five applicants that come through our door, U.S. Army Captain Joshua Jacquez told CNN in a report from El Paso. Maj. Gen. Allen W. Batschelet, head of Army recruiting at Fort Knox, told the Kansas City Starin August that the policy is, rather arbitrary, in some sense. However he said that you have to draw the line somewhere for the Army to present a professional image. As for waivers, Batschelet said,To be blunt, the higher quality of applicant you are, the more tolerance we'd probably have for seeking a waiver. If you came in to sign up today and were a neurosurgeon, I got to tell you I'd go a long way toward trying to get an exception if all you had was a disqualifying tattoo. The Air Force,Marines and Navy also have their own tattoo policies. All of them generally ban tattoos that are obscene, advocate discrimination or express offensive views. The Air Force policy has a seven-step measurement guide that contains math formulas in an attempt to prevent tattoos from covering more than 25 percent of an exposed body part. (Partial inches should be rounded up to the nearest inch, it says.) The Marines policy states that applicants with more than four tattoos must be administratively reviewed. The Navys policy is the least detailed --only 277 words -- though like the other services, it bans head tattoos. Our ruling Bush said that among the reasons applicants are rejected by the military -- in addition to being obese or not passing the test -- is that some have too many tattoos on visible body parts. Since the Army updated its tattoo policy earlier this year, 2,919 applicants could not proceed due to tattoos. Other branches of the service also have restrictions on types and locations of tattoos that keep some applicants out of the military.",1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,True

Final Rating: True",A record number of immigrants not from Mexico are being apprehended at the border.,"Questioning the flow of unaccompanied Central American children across the Texas-Mexico border, Gov. Rick Perry declared he has yet to hear from President Barack Obama or his administration to a 2012 letter urging attention to the matter. Perry went on to say on Fox & Friends June 17, 2014: We have record-high numbers of other than Mexicans being apprehended at the border. These are people that are coming from states like Syria that have substantial connections to terrorist regimes and terrorist operations. Both of those claims drew our interest, though for this story, were tackling only Perrys statement that a record number of immigrants not from Mexico are being apprehended at the border. Well check his reference to people coming from states like Syria in another article. The increased flow of children from Central American nations has attracted attention, in part, Douglas Massey, a Princeton University professor, suggested this month, because fewer Mexicans are being detained near the border than any year since 1971. An online U.S. Border Patrol chart shows about 265,000 Mexicans were caught near the border in the fiscal year that ran through September 2013. That was up 3,000 from the year before, according to the chart, but down at least 15,000 compared to any of the previous dozen years. News reports suggest multiple factors in this surge including a contrast: The Border Patrol routinely and quickly returns immigrants from Mexico across the Rio Grande; that's not an option for handling individuals from distant countries like El Salvador and Honduras. So, have non-Mexican detentions at the border reached a record level? To our inquiry, Perry spokeswoman Lucy Nashed said Perry drew his conclusion about a record being set from information provided by the Texas Department of Public Safety. We turned to the Border Patrol for numbers. The federal agency posted an online chart indicating its officers apprehended 153,055 people from countries other than Mexico in the fiscal year that ran through September 2013. Thats more than in any of the seven previous years. That chart shows, though, that 165,170 other than Mexicans were apprehended in fiscal 2005. The numbers include all Border Patrol regions, including the northern border with Canada and coastal boundaries. Every year, though, the vast majority of such apprehensions occur in the agencys Southwest Border region, running from San Diego to the tip of Texas. And what about the South Texas portions of the border that have received attention recently? The chart shows nearly 115,000 apprehensions from countries other than Mexico in the agencys Laredo and Rio Grande Valley sectors in fiscal 2013, which outpaced the previous high of 100,647 in fiscal 2005. Tighter focus: The 96,829 other than Mexico apprehensions in the Rio Grande Valley sector in 2013 was 21 percent greater than the sectors previous high (at least since fiscal 2000) of 79,854 such apprehensions in 2005. By telephone, a Del Rio-based Border Patrol spokesman, Dennis Smith, brought us up to speed on other than Mexico apprehensions from October 2013 through May 2014, or the first eight months of fiscal 2014. In that period, he said, there were 165,729 such apprehensions nationally, including 162,749 in the Southwest region, counting what would be a 15-year high of 122,071 (and counting) in the Rio Grande Valley sector. Separately, analyst Jessica Vaughan of the Center for Immigration Studies, a think tank focused on reduced immigration, emailed us its chart demonstrating a surge since early 2011 in other than Mexico apprehensions in the Rio Grande Valley sector:   We asked Smith if for historys sake, we should try to gauge apprehensions before 2000, the earliest year on the Border Patrols chart. Smith said there werent more such apprehensions any year before 2000. Our own brief look for older data led us to a Sept. 22, 2005, report by the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service indicating fewer people from countries other than Mexico were apprehended in 1997, 1998 and 1999. Finally: The number of unaccompanied children being picked up also has been record-setting, according to a June 4, 2014, New York Times news story. Since Oct. 1, a record 47,017 unaccompanied children have been apprehended at the southwest United States border, the story said, most traveling from Central America, part of a larger wave that includes some youngsters accompanied by their parents and some traveling alone. The story said that according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection, that 47,017 total is nearly twice as high as all of the last fiscal year (24,493 apprehensions), with four months yet to go in the current fiscal year. And, a June 5, 2014, Times news story said, an internal draft Homeland Security document projects unaccompanied-minor apprehensions rising to 90,000 in the current fiscal year, running through September 2014. Peter Boogaard, a Homeland Security spokesman, told the paper the draft document was not official policy and had not been finalized or circulated. Our ruling Perry said a record number of immigrants not from Mexico are being apprehended at the border. We didnt come up with apprehension figures for every year through history. But available figures show the Border Patrol apprehended more people from countries other than Mexico along the border through the first eight months of fiscal 2014 than it apprehended in any of the preceding 17 years.

Final Rating: True  ","Between 1980 and 2010, water usage in Georgia dropped even as the states population grew.","The bad news regarding water in Georgia is legion. No major reservoir has been built since the 2007-2008 drought to insulate metro Atlanta from future water shortages. Water/sewer rates have gone up in several counties to cover everything from federally mandated upgrades to increased material costs. Then there is the so-called water war with Alabama and Florida, a multi-year battle of lawsuits over how to meet the water needs across the states. So it was a surprise to read the recent headline in the Athens Banner-Herald: Water use in Georgia declines, even as population grows. The trend, the May 10, 2015 story said, was a 30 percent drop in water usage in the three decades between 1980 and 2010, the last year that federal data was available. Suffice it to say the claim whet our appetite – we save wetting our whistle for after-hours – for the numbers and what might be going on. We reached out to the U.S. Geological Survey, which has a mandate to file a water usage report for the nation every five years. In concert with that work, the agency encourages states to conduct their own reports. Georgia has compiled a report every five years since 1975, in a bid to provide information about the precious resource in a state without a single natural lake. The 1980 report shows that year, Georgia sucked 6.7 billion gallons of water from Georgia rivers and aquifers every day. In 2010, it sipped 4.7 billion gallons every day. While the reports in that overall span show some increases – including a 21 percent jump in daily use during the 1990s – water usage has plunged 30 percent when looking at the three decades. Census figures show the number of people living in Georgia over that period exploded, from 5.46 million in 1980 to 9.69 million in 2010. Thats a 77 percent increase. Given the well-known water woes in the Peach State, how is that possible? Conservation plays some role, which we will get into in a moment. But the biggest factor was the change in how thermoelectric plants across the state operated. Several of the facilities were decommissioned between 2000 and 2010 – during the worst of the drought years and the decade that saw usage plunge nearly 28 percent, said Steve Lawrence, a hydrologist with the USGS in Atlanta. Several other plants converted from coal-fired, which needs plenty of water to cool it as an energy source, to natural gas, Lawrence said. Thermoelectric withdrawals account typically for a third of withdrawals, so all water withdrawals decrease when such a large user drops its share, Lawrence said. Data is not available for 1980 for the per capita usage in Georgia. But 1985 and 2010 figures mirror the overall trend. Every Georgian used about 860 gallons of water daily in 1985 but only 470 gallons daily in 2010, Lawrence said. Those totals include a persons share of water that a utility, say Georgia Power, uses to provide electricity. Its unclear what the per person usage would be in 1985, if the water used by agriculture, industry and utilities are removed. But in 2010, it was an estimated 75 gallons a day per person to bathe, cook and clean, Lawrence said. Thats a good number, one you see with the push for water-efficient fixtures and conservation efforts like tiered pricing, Lawrence said. Local water providers, however, dont always follow the statewide trend. The Cobb County Water System can provide daily usage dating back to 1986, when the then-small county used just 38.6 million gallons countywide. In 1990, when the county had about 451,000 people, average daily use was 42.5 million gallons countywide. In 2010, about 688,000 people lived in Cobb, and daily usage was 57.1 million gallons for the county. Thats a 53 percent jump in population, and a 34 percent increase in daily usage. Although the daily usage did not keep pace with the population increase, the jump itself bucks the state trend. However, water system officials point out that Cobb saw usage drop 14 percent countywide between 2006 and 2014, during the worst of the recent droughts. The 2014 daily usage, of 104 gallons per person, also is down 15 percent from the 122 gallons per person in 2005, when the county began looking at per capita usage. You can see very clearly the impact of our water conservation efforts, which became much more aggressive in 2008, county spokeswoman AikWah Leow said. Our ruling News reports claimed that Georgia has seen its water usage drop over the past three decades, in the same period that the population mushroomed. Federal reports confirm that unlikely shift, largely due to a change from coal-fired electric plants to facilities powered by natural gas. Conservation efforts also have made an impact, even if local water systems dont show quite the same drop in usage. But the statewide trend is clear.",1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,True

Final Rating: True  ",Says that in the recent year homeowners across Ohio have signed mineral rights agreements and I understand that over a billion dollars worth of leases have been signed to date.,"Ohio Gov. John Kasich has enthusiastically cheered the money-making prospects of hydraulic fracking, a technique used to extract oil and gas from underground shale.Eastern Ohio, with its energy-laden Utica and Marcellus shale formations, is high on the list of targeted areas where companies are looking buy up rights to drill for the lucrative resources below.But many have voiced environmental concerns over the process, which pumps millions of gallons of chemical-laced water and sand deep into horizontal wells under high pressure. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency is studying hydraulic frackings effects on drinking water. And New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, a Republican whose pugnacious and conservative style is often compared with Kasichs, last month ordered a one-year moratorium on the practice so more information can be gathered. Enter Ohio State Sen. Michael Skindell. Skindell, a Lakewood Democrat, this month introduced Senate Bill 213, which would institute a ban on hydraulic fracking until the EPA completes its study and lawmakers have time to digest it. A companion bill would require companies to disclose chemicals it uses when drilling. Both pieces legislation are aimed at what Skindell sees as a fracking bonanza. In the recent year, we have seen the oil and gas companies go to homeowners throughout Ohio and encourage them to sign leases and turn over mineral rights for this process, Skindell said during a Statehouse news conference to promote the two bills. And I understand that over a billion dollars worth of leases have been signed to date. That billion-dollar figure caught PolitiFact Ohios attention, given the relatively fledgling fracking market. True, reports across Ohio have pegged the Utica shale formations in eastern Ohio as a new frontier of sorts. But $1 billion? We went to Skindell to learn his source. Skindell shared with us a web link to a March story published by the Dayton Daily News. The newspaper focused on one company, Chesapeake Energy Corp. of Oklahoma City. Chesapeake, the article noted, has reportedly spent $1 billion acquiring leases in Ohio without drilling a producing well, a figure reported by the Wall Street Journal on March 7. By the time it left Skindells lips, it was a fact repeated at least third-hand. If it was a fact all. So off to the Wall Street Journal we went. The March 7 story attributed the $1 billion figure to Chesapeake. Journal reporter Ryan Dezember referred PolitiFact Ohio to earnings statements and other financial documents from the publicly held company. Mindful that the news at this point was 6 months old, Dezember theorized that the figure had likely grown. Sure enough, a transcript of a July 29 conference call between Chesapeake executives, investors and analysts and Chairman and Chief Executive Aubrey McClendon confirmed this. ... Weve spent between $1.5 billion and $2 billion acquiring leasehold in the Utica, said McClendon, referring to the shale in eastern Ohio. And of course, Chesapeake wouldnt have invested that amount if executives werent convinced the resources could yield much more. In a financial report issued the day before the conference call, Chesapeake noted that officials believed the Utica shale play could add between $15 billion and $20 billion in value. Chesapeake is not the only party interested in Ohio shale. Clif Little, an Ohio State University extension educator in Guernsey and Noble counties, said more than 1,200 property owners have taken his leasing farmland for oil and gas classes this year. Drilling companies, small oil and gas companies, landowner associations and attorneys all are attempting to secure deep drilling rights, Little added. The $1 billion figure is an old figure, Little wrote in an email. The amount invested in the Utica and Marcellus would far exceed that number today, but I am no longer keeping track of investment figures. Although he might not have been right on the money, Skindell was very much in the ballpark with respect to Chesapeakes figures. If anything, he undersold the political point he was trying to make: that Ohio is on the cusp of a fracking boom. Skindells words were over a billion dollars worth of leases, and clearly that is the case.",1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,True

Final Rating: Mostly False  ",Californias Proposition 63 would CRIMINALIZE the sharing of ammunition between friends who may be hunting or shooting together.," Proposition 63, a gun and ammunition control initiative on Californias November ballot, would require instant background checks for the sale of ammunition statewide. Known as the Safety For All Initiative and proposed by Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom, the measure is considered a significant addition to Californias already strict gun regulations. The initiative is in some cases more stringent than gun control bills introduced by state Senate leader Kevin De León and recently signed into law by Gov. Jerry Brown. Recently, a gun rights group, the Firearms Policy Coalition, in a June 16 email blast claimed Proposition 63 would restrict not only ammo sales, but criminalize the sharing of bullets between hunting and shooting partners. The Sacramento-based coalition describes itself as a grassroots nonprofit dedicated to defending Second Amendment rights. We decided to examine the claim: Would Proposition 63 really criminalizes the sharing of bullets between friends? Our research We started by checking the text of the Proposition. It broadly restricts ammunition sales by requiring instant background checks and requiring, by January 2018, all sales be conducted or processed through a licensed ammunition vendor, according to Section 8 of the text. Law enforcement would be exempted. Currently, the state does not require a license or record keeping for ammunition sales, according to the San Francisco-based Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence. By contrast, the restrictions Proposition 63 places on sharing or transferring ammunition are not as strict. Still, they would change some aspects of the largely unregulated practice. The measure would: -- Make it illegal for an individual to share bullets with any person who he or she knows or using reasonable care should know is banned from owning or possessing ammunition; -- Make it illegal for someone to share bullets if they know they will be subsequently sold or transferred to a person banned from owning them; -- Require individuals meet face-to-face to transfer ammunition; The new crimes would be classified as a misdemeanors, punishable by up to one year in jail and a $1,000 fine, according to the measure. They are listed under proposed changes to Sections 30306 and 30312 of the California Penal Code. They could still freely transfer and share that ammunition with their hunting and shooting partners provided that they do so in person and do not have knowledge that the ammunition would subsequently be provided to a felon or other prohibited person, Dan Newman, spokesman for the Safety For All Initiative, wrote in an email. Representatives from the Firearms Policy Coalition did not respond to our requests for comment. An AK-47 rifle 30-round magazine is seen with 30 rounds of 7.62x39mm ammunition, in Alexandria, Va., Wednesday, Feb. 10, 2016. (AP Photo/Cliff Owen) Our ruling The Firearms Policy Coalition recently claimed Californias Proposition 63 would Criminalize the sharing of ammunition between friends who may be hunting or shooting together. The initiative would create some new restrictions on bullet sharing. It would be it illegal to knowingly share bullets with a felon; to share with any other person banned from owning them; or with anyone who would subsequently share them with a banned person. It would also require people meet face-to-face to transfer ammunition. Breaking the new rules would be considered a misdemeanor. The coalitions statement, however, gives the wrong and overly broad impression that friends on a hunting trip or at a shooting range could never legally share a bullet -- that somehow the measure would criminalize all aspects of sharing a box of bullets with your shooting partner. Instead, the vast majority of people could keep sharing, as long as they know or within reason should know theyre not sharing with a felon or another person prohibited from owning a gun and ammunition.

Final Rating: False",The Democrat-backed health care reform plan will require (Americans) to subsidize abortion with their hard-earned tax dollars.,"In an already contentious health care debate, the last thing the Obama administration wants is a fight over abortion. The word abortion was never mentioned in the initial health care plans released by the House and Senate. The decision of whether to offer abortion coverage in the proposed public plan, then, would be left up to the health and human services secretary. Abortion opponents said that would allow Democrats to slip abortion into the plan as part of the standard coverage. In an op-ed piece on July 23, House Republican Leader John Boehner of Ohio repeated the concerns of many who oppose abortion that the Democratic-backed health care reform plan will require (Americans) to subsidize abortion with their hard-earned tax dollars. Although there are several versions of the health care bill kicking around in Congress, one thing has now become clear: Most envision a government-run health plan option that could include abortion coverage, as well as a health care exchange in which participating private insurance companies would be permitted to offer such coverage. But does that mean that federal tax dollars would be used to subsidize abortions? That's a more difficult question. Let's back up a minute and explain some background: Currently, the 1976 Hyde Amendment prohibits the use of federal funds for abortions through Medicaid except in cases of rape, incest or when the mother's health is in peril. So states that want to offer abortion coverage have to pay for it themselves. Similar restrictions on public funding for abortions applies to federal health care coverage extended to active and retired military and federal employees. President Barack Obama gave a nod to that precedent when asked in a July 21 CBS interview with Katie Couric whether he favored a government option that would cover abortions. Obama said, As you know, I'm prochoice. But I think we also have a tradition of, in this town, historically, of not financing abortions as part of government-funded health care. Rather than wade into that issue at this point, I think that it's appropriate for us to figure out how to just deliver on the cost savings, and not get distracted by the abortion debate at this station. Abortion opponents had hoped similar restrictions to those in the Hyde Amendment would be placed on any government-run health care option, and also be extended to any private insurance companies that participate in the government-sponsored health care exchange, which will provide health insurance for people who don't get it through their employer. To that end, Rep. Bart Stupak, D-Mich., offered an amendment to the House health care proposal that would prohibit the use of public money to cover any part of the costs of any health plan that includes coverage of abortion. The amendment was narrowly defeated. Donna Crane, policy director for NARAL Pro-Choice America, called Stupak's proposal a radical departure from the status quo, because millions of women who currently have private insurance plans that cover abortions would be stripped of that coverage if their plan ultimately became part of the exchange — which seems likely. According to a 2002 Guttmacher Institute study, 87 percent of employment-based insured health plans offered coverage for abortions (though not all companies select it for their employees). A 2003 Kaiser Family Foundation survey found that 46 percent of covered workers had coverage for abortions. The two surveys asked different questions, but the bottom line is that a significant percentage of women currently have health insurance that covers abortions. And so began the debate over how to make the health care reform bill abortion neutral. A compromise plan offered by Rep. Lois Capps, D-Calif., which passed the House Energy and Commerce Committee, seeks to alleviate many of the concerns expressed by abortion opponents — particularly the issue of tax dollars being used to subsidize abortions — while specifically making abortion coverage available in both the public plan and in private plans participating in the exchange. Under the Capps amendment: • Abortion coverage would not be part of the required minimum benefits package. In other words, insurers would not be required to offer, or be prohibited from offering, abortion services in order to participate in the exchange. • The public plan could include abortion coverage, but the cost of the additional coverage could not be paid through public subsidies (tax dollars), only through the premiums paid by the insured. And with private plans in the exchange, again, federal subsidies could not be used for abortion coverage. • Public funding would only be permitted for abortions allowed under the Hyde Amendment — in cases of rape, incest or when the mother's life is in danger. • At least one plan in every region must offer full abortion coverage; and one must not. • Any insurance plan participating in the exchange cannot discriminate against hospitals or other health care facilities (such as Catholic hospitals) that are unwilling to provide abortions. • The plan will not pre-empt any state laws regarding abortion, such as parental notification laws. Douglas Johnson, legislative director for National Right to Life, said the amendment is hardly a compromise, and the pledge not to prohibit the use of public funds amounts to little more than symbolic bookkeeping. The Capps amendment may claim to segregate funds used for abortions, he said, but the bottom line is you have the government paying subsidies to people who are then able to obtain abortion coverage. And, he said, It's still the government running the whole plan. The government would be participating in the killing of unborn children under the guise of a health care plan, Johnson said. But that's not the opinion of all antiabortion groups. Chris Korzen, executive director of Catholics United, which opposes abortion, said his group doesn't want to see an important health care plan derailed by a misleading campaign that claims the health care plan would mean taxpayer-subsidized abortions. The goal should be to maintain the current policies, Korzen said. That Capps amendment accomplishes just that. It specifically prohibits taxpayers' funding of abortions. It disappoints me that there are people who are still making that claim. And, he said, there's a lot to be happy about, including the fact that abortion coverage was not included as part of the required minimum benefits package. Crane said NARAL believes abortion should be treated like any other health service. But they think the Capps amendment at least maintains the status quo, and that it helped to alleviate many of the concerns expressed by abortion opponents. We thought they got everything they wanted, Crane said. We are confused why they continue to push. Obviously, there's a lot at stake in the health care bill for both sides in the abortion debate. The fact that several versions of the health care reform bill are floating around Congress makes it difficult to say with certainty what the final plan will or will not include. But while it appears likely the plan would allow for the coverage of abortions, we don't see anything in the plans that would require taxpayers to foot the bill for that. In fact, in a key version of the bill — the one passed by the House Energy and Commerce Committee — members went to great pains to include an amendment to ensure that federal money is not used for abortion coverage. Again, things could change as the health reform package works its way through Congress, but for now, we don't see anything to support Boehner's claim that taxpayers would subsidize abortions. And so we rule his statement False.",0,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,False

Final Rating: False  ",Says a bill co-sponsored by Sen. Claire McCaskill would give a free pass to any illegal immigrant who brings a child to the border.,"Missouri Attorney General Josh Hawley and outside groups supporting his campaign have criticized Sen. Claire McCaskill for her views on immigration during their Senate race. A recent salvo in this subtext of their contest comes from Hawley in the form of an op-ed for FoxNews.com.  now she (McCaskill) is sponsoring the most radical open-border bill ever introduced in Congress, Hawley wrote. Her bill was written by California liberal Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein, and it would give a free pass to any illegal immigrant who brings a child to the border. Hawley is referring to the Keep Families Together Act, which would bar family separations except if the child is at risk of trafficking and abuse by parents or guardians. Kelli Ford, the Hawley campaigns press secretary, said that Hawleys free pass comments meant that if you are an immigrant coming here illegally with a child, this bill would let you enter into the United States. With immigration becoming a wedge issue between McCaskill and Hawley, we spoke to experts and consulted the text of the bill to determine the accuracy of Hawleys assertion. Ford pointed to the language of the bill from Section 2(a), which, in her words, tells agents/officers that they cant remove a child from a parent/legal guardian within the 100-mile limit of the United States. Thats true — with exceptions. Border officials could separate if the child is a victim of trafficking or at significant risk of it; if there's a strong likelihood that the adult is not the parent; or if the child is in danger of abuse or neglect. State courts and state or county child welfare agencies can also separate families if it's in the child's best interest. Finally, Ford pointed to an excerpt from the bill that says children cant be removed from guardians solely for the policy goal of deterring individuals from migrating to the United States or for the policy goal of promoting compliance with civil immigration laws. Hawleys depiction of the Keeping Families Together Act is incorrect, experts said. The bill would not grant illegal immigrants a pass — free or otherwise — to enter or live legally or illegally in the United States, David Bier, an immigration policy analyst at the libertarian Cato Institute think tank wrote in an email. It would only prohibit the separation of children from their parents who come to the border unless the child is a victim of trafficking or abuse. Bier went on to write that the bill does not forbid the removal of parents who are undocumented immigrants from the U.S., meaning it does not change existing immigration law, nor does it seek to make it easier for such parents or guardians to stay in the U.S. Leon Fresco, an immigration attorney based in Washington, D.C., put his objections to Hawleys claim simply: Nothing in this bill prevents the removal of a family unit in its entirety. The bill does not block families from being detained together, said Fresco, aformer deputy assistant attorney general who drafted the Senates comprehensive immigration reform bill in 2013. While Fresco understands the reasoning behind thinking its wrong to prevent the government from prosecuting an adult for crossing the border illegally if they bring their child, that is not what this proposed law would do. It only prevents the separation of the adult and the child, Fresco wrote. The bill does not put forth safeguards for immigrants without documentation; adults can still be prosecuted. Matt Barreto, UCLA professor of political science and Chicana/o studies, was adamant in his disagreement with Hawleys conclusion about the bill: It absolutely does not do that. It just blocks DHS/CBP from taking children away from their parents, Barreto wrote in an email. People still have to go through all the normal procedures for asylum, refugee or immigration. The Hawley campaign pointed out that Barretos firm Latino Decisions did polling work for the Hillary Clinton campaign. Hawley said McCaskill backed a bill that would give a free pass to any illegal immigrant who brings a child to the border. The bill in question takes no such measure. Undocumented immigrants are not afforded any new protections from prosecution under the bill; it seeks to stop the separation of immigrant children from their families or guardians. The thinking behind Hawleys charge against McCaskill has been echoed by Republican officials throughout the country. That doesnt make it more right.

Final Rating: Half True  ",The nation as a whole has created jobs at a rate that is two times the rate that we have created jobs here in Wisconsin under Gov. Walker.,"Introducing President Barack Obama in Milwaukee, Democratic gubernatorial hopeful Mary Burke touted economic growth nationwide when compared to that in Wisconsin under Gov. Scott Walker: The nation as a whole has created jobs at a rate that is two times the rate that we have created jobs here in Wisconsin under Gov. Walker. Asked to back up the claim, the Burke campaign pointed us to data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics quarterly employment surveys. That data is considered the most reliable measure of jobs, though it is less timely than that from separate monthly employment surveys. The campaign told us the statistics show U.S. growth at nearly twice the rate of Wisconsin. Burke, though, was more definitive at the rally, saying two times the rate. Burkes phrasing of the talking point has changed. In early 2014, she said the latest data from the quarterly surveys showed the national rate was nearly double Wisconsins rate. At that point, she quoted a Milwaukee Journal Sentinel story that came to the same conclusion after Wisconsin reported 1 percent growth compared with 1.9% nationally from June 2012 to June 2013. At the time, that was the latest available data, due to the lag time in the release of the detailed quarterly numbers, We crunched the same numbers the Burke campaign cited, examining private-sector employment, which has been the central focus of both candidates plans. Figures show that from the start of Walkers term to the end of his third year, the national gain was 6.6 percent compared to Wisconsins 4.1 percent. That meant the U.S. growth was 1.6 times that of Wisconsins. In the most recent year (March 2013 to March 2014), Wisconsins growth rate was 1.3 percent, compared with the U.S. rate of 2.1 percent. Same result: the national rate was 1.6 times better. As we examined year-over-year growth at different quarterly vantage points, we repeatedly saw growth 1.6 to 1.7 times larger for the national figures. (We also looked at results from another government jobs survey, the monthly reports. They are more up to date -- through September 2014 -- but less reliable. They, too, show, national growth at 1.6 times the states, from the start of Walkers term.) There were some smaller and larger differences at various points along the way. Annual growth rates in the United States in 2011, 2012 and 2013, and into early 2014 ranged from 1.2 to 2 times larger than Wisconsins. The high point was from September 2011 to September 2012, when the rate was twice that of Wisconsin. Our rating Burke claimed that the nation as a whole has created jobs at a rate that is two times the rate that we have created jobs here in Wisconsin under Gov. Walker. Wisconsin lags behind the nation significantly, but for the most part quite not as badly as Burke says, based on the last year and on results from most of Walkers term.",0.5,0.5,1,0.5,0,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,Half True

Final Rating: Half True  ","Says the average Ohio student graduates from a four-year college or university with nearly $27,000 in tuition debt.","Editor's note: We originally rated this claim True. After receiving feedback from readers, we have downgraded that rating to Half True because the claim applies the average debt of about $27,000 to a much broader group than did the study from which it was cited. Interest rates on federally subsidized student loans went on the front burner as a political issue after Mitt Romney followed President Obama in saying he did not want those rates to go up. Congressional Republicans -- who earlier passed a budget allowing the rates to double in July to their 2007 rate of 6.8 percent -- closed ranks behind their presumptive presidential nominee.They voted for a hastily introduced bill that would keep the rate at 3.4 percent, and pay for it with funds intended for preventive health care programs under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.Raiding that fund made the legislation unpalatable for Democrats -- just as the Democratic proposals to extend the lower interest rates were unpalatable to Republicans.One of the proposals would have paid for the college loan subsidies by ending tax subsidies for oil and gas companies. Another would end a payroll tax exemption given some business owners.Ohio's Sen. Sherrod Brown was a co-sponsor of the latter bill and of earlier legislation to stop the loan rates from going up.Federally-subsidized Stafford loans have allowed thousands of students—who might not otherwise be able pay for to college—afford the ever-increasing cost of higher education, he said in a news release. With the average Ohio student graduating from a four-year institution with nearly $27,000 in tuition bills, the last thing we should be doing is adding to their already-heavy debt load.The figure of $27,000 caught the notice of PolitiFact Ohio. It is more than $6,700 per year for four years of school.We asked Brown's office for his source and more information. They referred us to the Project on Student Debt, a project of the independent, nonprofit Institute for College Access and Success.Its most recent survey of public and private four-year institutions in Ohio found that 68 percent of students graduate in debt, and that the average debt on college loans is $27,713 -- the 7th-highest statewide average in the nation. (New Hampshire was highest, with average debt of $31,048; Wyoming was lowest, with $20,571.)The actual debt level is probably higher, the Project on Student Debt noted, because the data is voluntarily reported by colleges and not available for all of them.The report also reflects only graduates of public and private nonprofit colleges because few for-profit colleges report the student debt data. Based on national surveys by the U.S. Department of Education, graduates of for-profit four-year colleges are much more likely to borrow student loans, and borrow significantly more, than counterparts at nonprofit institutions.Nationally, according to a report from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, the average student loan balance per borrower is $23,300. The median balance is roughly half of that, $12,800. About one-quarter of borrowers nationally owe more than $28,000, and about 10 percent owe more than $54,000, according to the New York Fed.In aggregate, the bank said, the outstanding student loan balance now stands at about $870 billion, surpassing the nations total credit card balance ($693 billion) and the total auto loan balance ($730 billion). About 37 million people hold outstanding student loan debt.The key with all these figures is that they deal specifically with students who borrow and then graduate with loan debt.So how does that mesh with Browns claim? In his statement he said the average Ohio student graduating from a four-year institution. That describes a bigger pool of people than just the students who graduate with debt. In that most recent survey it would also include the 32 percent of the graduates who had no debt. But the figure Brown cited, nearly $27,000, was an average covering just those students who graduated with debt.Browns statement is partially accurate. He cites the correct figure from a survey on debt among college students. But he describes those affected by debt too broadly, applying the average to all rather than just those who graduate with loan balances. Including all students would lower the average for loan debt by about a third.

Final Rating: Half True","Says Kansas U.S. House candidate Paul Davis was caught with a stripper during a drug raid and later voted to allow strip clubs to open near homes, churches, schools and daycare facilities.","A new ad from the Congressional Leadership Fund, a super PAC working to protect the GOP Majority in the U.S. House, attacks a Kansas congressional hopeful for an incident at a strip club 20 years ago. You bet we wanted to see if the facts here stood up to scrutiny. Democrat Paul Davis is locked in a competitive race with Republican Steve Watkins in Kansas 2nd Congressional District, a seat that includes Topeka, Lawrence and the communities west of Kansas City. The ad targets Davis for his alleged involvement in a 1998 strip club drug raid, where he was found in a dark room with a nearly naked woman. Whats worse than getting caught at a strip club during a drug bust? Ask Paul Davis. The ad then claims Davis was found in a VIP room with a woman wearing only a G-string.Then it says, Even worse, after Davis was caught with a stripper, he voted to allow strip clubs to open near our homes, churches, schools and even daycare facilities. Shady Paul Davis cant be trusted. Here, we are checking the details surrounding the strip club incident, along with the claim that Davis voted to allow strip clubs to operate near places like schools, homes, churches and daycares. The situation involving Davis and a strip club came to light in September 2014 during his bid for governor, which he lost. According to reports, Davis was getting a lap dance in a back room in the late 1990s when cops raided the club in search of drugs. He was not charged with a crime, but police involved in the raid reported he was found in a compromising position. Davis said he was at the wrong place at the wrong time. Independence Police Chief Harry Smith later corroborated Davis account that the candidate was not involved in any wrongdoing, or, to his knowledge, the focus of an investigation. He said Davis was questioned briefly before being released. Kelsi Browning, a spokeswoman for Davis campaign, told PolitiFact that the ad is based on something that happened 20 years ago when Davis was 26. As a new lawyer, she said, Daviswent with his boss to meet an unsavory client of the law firm. The ad refers to HB 2107, or the Community Defense Act, which was a 2011 state bill that would have prohibited strip clubs and other sexually oriented businesses from being established within 1,000 feet of the property line of an existing one as well as any schools, churches, public parks, residences, libraries or daycare centers. The bill would have also required semi-nude dancers to remain at least 6 feet away from their customers and for sexually oriented businesses to remain closed from midnight to 6 a.m. Davis was one of 28 Kansas House members who voted against the bill, which ultimately failed in the Senate. The Davis campaign says that the legislation was a perennial bill thatrarely made it out of committee. When it first came up in 2010, Davis actually voted for the bill before it was struck down in the Senate. It came up again in the 2011 session, but this time, he voted against it. Critics of the legislation, which included Davis, argued at the time that regulating these businesses was best left to cities and counties. Some also questioned taking the time to focus on the issue when the state was facing a massive budget deficit. In a Lawrence Journal-World story around the time of the vote, Davis, who was the House minority leader, was quoted saying that the Legislature was probably intruding in areas where we dont need to be. Weve got a lot more important things that we need to be dealing with here. The Congressional Leadership Fund ad says that Kansas U.S. House candidate Paul Davis was caught with a stripper during a drug raid and later voted to allow strip clubs to open near homes, churches, schools and daycares. The ad is piecing together two unrelated issues to draw an unsavory conclusion, while embellishing parts of the story. Davis did not vote to allow strip clubs to open near schools, churches, daycares and the like. He once voted against a measure that would have banned them from opening near these places. He also once voted for the same proposal. The ads claim that he was found in a strip club during a drug raid is accurate, but any suggestion he was connected to the drug raid is misplaced. Overall, this claim is partially accurate but takes things out of context.",0.5,0.8,0.9,0.6,0.7,0.8,0.5,0.8,0.6,Half True

Final Rating: Half True  ","Cuts in local government and school funding in John Kasichs budget caused many communities to seek school levies, local tax increases, layoffs.","After a recent appearance on NBC's Meet the Press in which Gov. John Kasich said he had balanced Ohio's budget and cut taxes, the Ohio Democratic Party issued a statement that his budget had negative consequences for local communities.Kasich slashed local government and school funding to the bone, the statement said, causing many communities to seek school levies, local tax increases, layoffs to offset budget cuts.PolitiFact Ohio decided to check out the claim.The governor's office answered with its own statement. It said the number of local government workers in Ohio has increased under Kasich after decreasing under his Democratic predecessor, Ted Strickland, and that the number of local tax issues has declined.PolitiFact Ohio was intrigued. Kasich and other Republicans often talk about shrinking the size of government. We found he was accurate, three months ago, when he said the number of state workers in Ohio had gone down.So it was something like a man bites dog story for him to boast that local government employment increased on his watch after declining under a Democratic administration.Kasich's spokesman referred us to the employment database of the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics.It showed that the number of local government workers in Ohio in July 2011, when the Kasich budget went into effect, was 520,600. It was 526,200 in preliminary numbers for May, the most recent number available -- an increase of 5,600 workers.The number stood at 554,700 in July 2007, when the first Strickland budget went into effect, and 523,400 in June 2011 -- a decrease of 31,300.The decrease continued until last January, when it reached 520,000, the lowest level since 1999. The peak of local government employment in Ohio was 560,600, reached in July 2004, according to the BLS.Kasich spokesman Rob Nichols also pointed to the local election tallies on the Ohio secretary of state website. The figures show tax issues were at the lowest levels since 2003, he said, countering the claim that Kasich's budget led to local tax increases.We looked, though we find it difficult to draw any conclusions about local finances from a simple count of the number of tax issues on local ballots. For consistency of comparison, we looked at November general-election tallies. (There has been one November general election and one spring primary since Kasich's budget went into effect.)What we found was a general consistency in the number of tax issues: a total of 1,009 last November; 1,059 in November 2010; 1,100 in November 2009; 1,053 in November 2008, and 995 in 2007 -- the lowest level in the years for which a local issues summary was available.Kasich's two-year budget, signed a year ago, cut state funding for local governments by about $630 million over the two years, and cut funding for schools by about $700 million. The governor challenged local governments to be more efficient and creative to deal with the cuts without raising taxes.Ohio Democratic Party Spokesman Jerid Kurtz cited 10 municipalities and school districts looking at layoffs and tax hikes that officials blamed on the funding cuts.One was the city of Lima. Its finance director said it had a balanced budget as recently as 2008, but faced a $2 million deficit in its general fund, largely because of state budget cuts, despite reducing the general fund consistently for the past 10 years, the Lima News reported.Another was Sycamore Township, near Cincinnati. It laid off most of its firefighters in May 2012 because, township officials said, state budget cuts would eliminate half of the community's general fund revenue.A third was the Berea school district, which passed a 3.9-mill operating levy in March 2012 after reducing its budget by $5.1 million for reasons that included the loss of state dollars.According to the Ohio School Boards Association, school levies passed in March 2012 at an exceptionally high rate of 74 percent, the highest level since November 2000. The usual passage rate for school levies in Ohio is about 54 percent, the group said.The growth in local government employment is more likely due to the Ohio recovery that began a full year before Kasich took office, Kurtz said. There is absolutely no proof Kasich's budget is the cause.Seeking further perspective, we called the Ohio Municipal League, which lobbies for cities and villages. Communications director Kent Scarrett said he certainly agreed there is more of an uptick in school levies because of state funding cuts, and said the full impact has not yet been felt.The biggest cuts in direct payments to municipalities through the Local Government Fund will come in year two of Kasich's budget in 2013. The elimination of the estate tax in 2013, which is also part of the budget, will further reduce revenue to local governments.They're going to be up against it next year, Scarrett said. In 2013 the cuts are going to be much more profound. It's kind of scary.That's looking into the future, which we won't do.Let's get back to the statement we're checking: Kasich slashed local government and school funding to the bone, causing many communities to seek tax increases and lay off workers.The claim is partially accurate.Kasich's budget did cut funding for local governments significantly. Some school districts and municipalities have sought, considered or passed tax issues to deal with budget shortfalls to which the funding cuts have contributed. And the Ohio Democrats can provide anecdotal evidence that some budget shortfalls have threatened or led to layoffs.But the claim also overlooks important details that give the it context.The number of local government jobs in Ohio has actually increased since Kasich's budget was enacted, after dipping to a 12-year low. And the number of local tax issues to appear on ballots across Ohio has been steady for several years.Further, one of the outside experts we talked to says it is too soon to tell the full impact of cuts in funding because the biggest cuts through the Local Government Fund havent kicked in yet, nor has the elimination of the estate tax.On the Truth-O-Meter, the claim rates Half True.",0.5,0.5,1,0.5,0,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,Half True

Final Rating: Half True  ","Savings that I achieved helped fund cameras on the border. As a result, more than 21,500 arrests have been made and 46 tons of narcotics confiscated.","Lieutenant governor candidate Todd Staples says he not only has a plan that addresses border security, hes already tackled the challenge. Staples, Texas agriculture commissioner, wrote in a Jan. 13, 2014, campaign email blast, Using cost savings that I achieved from cutting government waste, I helped fund Operation Drawbridge, a low-cost, high-tech, DPS-led operation that placed game cameras along the border to detect illegal trafficking. As a result, more than 21,500 arrests have been made and 46 tons of narcotics confiscated. The Texas Department of Agriculture indeed approved aid for Operation Drawbridge, we learned, but the multimillion-dollar Department of Public Safety project had already been in place for most of a year. Also, Staples cited arrest and confiscation totals reflected Drawbridges overall results. In an interview, Staples told us his statement was intended to reflect totals for the entire program and hes never said all the results were due to Agriculture Department aid. Staples also stressed that his email blast said the agencys savings helped achieve the results. I dont want to get popped for something Ive never taken credit for, he said. Operation Drawbridge The states Department of Public Safety started Drawbridge in January 2012, according to its website. DPS spokesman Tom Vinger told us by email that Agriculture Department grants in October 2012 and August 2013 provided $345,000 to the program. The main source of Drawbridge funding, Vinger said, is the Criminal Justice Division of the Governors Office, which has so far provided grants totaling $2.5 million. A description of the initiative from a June 9, 2012, San Antonio Express-News news story said, (T)he department is installing 500 cameras along the border, part of an electronic monitoring program called Operation Drawbridge. It's an update of the much-criticized Texas Border Watch Program, a multimillion-dollar effort by the state to set up video cameras along the border. It was recently canceled after only a few dozen cameras were put in place over more than three years and unimpressive results. A 2013 DPS conference presentation placed online illustrates how Drawbridge uses modified off-the-shelf, motion-sensing, low-light cameras of the type hunters use to spot and track game at all hours. Farmers and ranchers volunteer to have the $300 cameras placed on their land near the Texas/Mexico border. Once an image is captured, software transmits it to law enforcement, and response times can be as quick as 10 minutes, according to the presentation.   Images from 2013 conference presentation on DPS website preparingtexas.org  Staples has long warned that because of a lack of border security, farmers and ranchers are under siege. His campaign spokesman, Bryan Black, told us via email that Staples helped bring landowner organizations into Operation Drawbridge. Staples told us his involvement with border security issues arose in response to landowners asking him for help. Savings to buy cameras Black said the grants came from agency savings in fiscal year 2013. Agriculture Department spokeswoman Lindsey Pope emailed us a chart with the agencys lapsed appropriations, money budgeted by lawmakers but ultimately unspent, in each biennium from 2006-07 through 2012-13. It showed the total returned to the state treasury in 2012-13 was $10.3 million. DPS spokesman Vinger sent us web links to his agencys Oct. 11, 2012, press release on the $225,000 grant and Aug. 8, 2013, release on the $120,000 grant. The 2012 release said, Operation Drawbridge is fully operational today with hundreds of cameras located along the border. This funding will essentially double the number of cameras involved in the program. Drawbridge was operating 750 cameras as of June 30, 2013, according to the online DPS presentation. Legislative Budget Board staff spokesman John Barton emailed us a Sept. 28, 2012, grant agreement between the agencies stating that the $225,000 grant was for the funding of additional DPS remote motion-sensing cameras, installation and monitoring activities associated with the surveillance along the border, particularly in those areas of the Texas-Mexico border where illegal activity and border violence have adversely affected rural landowners and the Texas agriculture industry. An Aug. 8, 2013, McAllen Monitor news story said, The $120,000 grant is for DPS to expand the program by purchasing more motion-sensing cameras. Arrests and confiscations From January 2012 through December 2013, according to Vinger and the DPS website, Drawbridge resulted in the apprehension of more than 22,950 individuals and more than 50 tons of narcotics. The October 2012 press release announcing the first Department of Agriculture grant said Drawbridge had resulted in the apprehension of approximately 4,000 individuals and 10 tons of narcotics since January 2012. So it would appear that at least 18,950 people and 40 tons of narcotics were captured from Oct. 11, 2012, through Dec. 31, 2013. Some supporting detail comes from the 2013 DPS conference presentation:   Our ruling Staples said savings he achieved helped fund cameras on the border and that as a result, more than 21,500 arrests were made and 46 tons of narcotics were confiscated. This statement could leave the misleading impression that a few hundred thousand dollars committed on Staples watch to an established program near the border culminated in the touted arrests and confiscations. Its documented that the grant money supported the border effort. But we dont see a way to tie particular arrests and confiscations to the grants. Also, this statement leaves out the critical fact that about 90 percent of the operations funding has come from federal aid awarded through the governors office.

Final Rating: Half True",You're more likely to be the victim of a violent crime in Milwaukee than in 96 percent of the country.,"Resentment and recrimination often characterize political relations between Milwaukee and the rest of Wisconsin. In the latest clash, the Milwaukee Public Schools board thwarted an effort by Republican state lawmakers to reform the low-performing district. That led the GOP leader of the Senate to say the Legislature might respond by cutting the districts funding. About two weeks later, on July 10, 2016, another GOP lawmaker issued a broadside against largely Democratic Milwaukee. State Sen. Van Wanggaard of Racine wrote an opinion piece in the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel that was laden with statistical claims unfavorable to the city -- including one making a national comparison about crime that we want to check. Recent complaints from Milwaukee leaders about their lack of state funding are misguided and lack perspective, the column began. Unfortunately, Wanggaard later wrote, the only way to cut this expenditure is to reduce the number of people needing assistance — reducing poverty. But the failing school system and Milwaukee's crime problem prevent that. Then came the claim were interested in, with Wanggaard saying you're more likely to be the victim of a violent crime in Milwaukee than in 96 percent of the country. Milwaukee is known for a relatively high violent crime rate. But this way of expressing that has some problems. Trends in violent crime Across the country, crime has been on a downward trend. Thats what PolitiFact National reported in June 2016 in rating as Pants on Fire Donald Trumps claim that crime is rising. With regard to violent crime, our colleagues checked FBI figures through 2014, the latest year for which complete figures are available. They found that nationally, the rates of violent crime per 100,000 people have been falling on an almost uninterrupted basis since the early 1990s. As counted by the FBIs Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR), violent crime includes murder, rape, robbery and aggravated assault. Milwaukees violent crime rate has been among the highest among large cities. In 2014, there were 8,864 violent crimes reported in the city, according to the FBI figures. That was up 8 percent from 8,194 in 2013. Now, to Wanggaards claim. Wanggaards evidence To back the statement, Wanggaards staff cited rankings from two websites that rank places to live. Each used the FBIs UCR violent crime figures for 2014. AreaVibes.com says Milwaukee is safer than 4 percent of the cities in the United States. Another way to say that would be that Milwaukees violent crime rate is higher than 96 percent of the country. NeighborhoodScout.com says the figure is 3 percent. Michael OHear, a law professor at Marquette University in Milwaukee, told us the rankings give some basis for Wanggaards 96 percent claim. But OHear and other criminal justice experts told us there are problems with the claim. Its sort of a dubious measure on so many grounds, said Alfred Blumstein, an emeritus professor of urban systems and operations research Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh. Comparison problems 1. UCR figures are solid. But the FBI strongly discourages using them to make rankings to evaluate different communities, saying: These incomplete analyses have often created misleading perceptions which adversely affect geographic entities and their residents. For this reason, the FBI has a long-standing policy against ranking participating law enforcement agencies on the basis of crime data alone  many factors cause the nature and type of crime to vary from place to place. 2. Across the country, violent crime generally is concentrated in larger cities, so it stands to reason there is less violent crime in most parts of the country. But the figures used in the website rankings compare Milwaukee with cities such as Mount Pleasant near Racine (15 violent crimes in 2014)and Sun Prairie (32) near Madison that have a population as low as 25,000. Theres a world of difference between a city of 25,000 and a city the size of Milwaukee (population 600,000), OHear said. 3. Violent crime in Milwaukee is concentrated in certain neighborhoods, while other neighborhoods carry no more risk of violent crime than many suburban neighborhoods. In other words, youre not suddenly at great risk of being a violent crime victim simply by crossing the city limits. Usually if youre not hanging out in high-crime neighborhoods, your chances of being a victim of crime are pretty low, said Michael Jacobson, executive director of the City University of New York Institute for State & Local Governance. Our rating Wanggaard said: You're more likely to be the victim of a violent crime in Milwaukee than in 96 percent of the country. Three rankings using violent crime rates from the FBI give Milwaukee such a ranking. But the FBI warns against using its figures to do rankings; the rankings compare Milwaukee to relatively tiny cities; and the claim makes a broad claim about Milwaukee but ignores the fact that most violent crime in the city is limited to certain neighborhoods.

If McGinty had won, Ds would have controlled the Senate after Doug Jones won and could have blocked Kavanaugh from the Supreme Court.","Mike Bloombergs past spending to help some Republican candidates has drawn the ire of Democrats, now that hes seeking to be their presidential nominee. But a Facebook post goes too far in linking his spending to help re-elect U.S. Sen. Pat Toomey, R-Pa., to the confirmation of U.S. Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh. In 2016, Toomey won a second term when he beat Democrat Katie McGinty, a former aide to Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Wolf and former environmental adviser to President Bill Clinton, by about 1.5 percentage points. Fact: Mike Bloomberg spent $12 million to re-elect a Senate Republican (Toomey) in 2016, stated the Facebook post. Toomey beat the Dem (McGinty) by 1.5 points. If McGinty had won, Ds would have controlled the Senate after Doug Jones won and could have blocked Kavanaugh from the Supreme Court. We found that Bloomberg did spend millions to help Toomey; whether that changed the outcome of the election is anybodys guess. But the post exaggerates when it says the race had the power to change the Supreme Court. The post was flagged as part of Facebooks efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Two ads by Bloombergs Independence USA PAC praised Toomey for crossing party lines to support background checks for gun buyers. Toomey backed legislation to expand checks to online sales and gun shows — a position shared by Bloomberg, who helped launch the gun control advocacy group Everytown for Gun Safety. A New York Times analysis of Bloombergs donations stated that he spent $11.7 million to support Toomey in 2016. Since 2012, the New York Times found, Bloomberg has helped candidates from both major parties, but his political committees have given more to Democrats than Republicans. We used the database of donations posted by the Center for Responsive Politics and found that Bloombergs Independence USA PAC spent $5.9 million in support of Toomey in 2016. As an individual, Bloomberg gave $2,700 to Toomeys campaign. The Pennsylvania U.S. Senate race was the most expensive general-election Senate contest in the nation in 2016, reaching a total of $170 million with candidate and outside spending combined. The Facebook post misleads when it states, if McGinty had won, Ds would have controlled the Senate after Doug Jones won. At the beginning of 115th Congress in January 2017, there were 52 Republicans, 46 Democrats and 2 independents who caucused with the Democrats. When Alabama Democrat Doug Jones took office in January 2018, that gave Republicans a 51-49 lead. If McGinty had won, the Senate would have ended up at 50-50. So who would have been in control? Washington University political scientist Steve Smith said that there are Senate precedents that allow the vice presidents party — in this case Mike Pence — to be treated as the majority party. When the 2000 elections produced a 50-50 tie and a Republican vice president, the two parties worked out a power-sharing agreement that provided for committees to be equally divided between the parties but with Republican chairs, Smith said. However the majority leader was the Republican leader. If the Senate found itself in another 50-50 split, that would lead to another round of negotiations. The Democrats would not control the Senate in the case of a 50-50 division, he said. To the contrary, some power sharing arrangement would again be negotiated and the term control, an informal term, really would not fit. If the vice president was Republican, the majority leader would be Republican. Now that brings us to the part of the Facebook post that said after Jones won, if McGinty had also won, the Democrats could have blocked Kavanaugh from the Supreme Court. This statement does have a qualifier of could, but if it assumes that a McGinty win alone could have changed the outcome. Thats misleading. The Senate voted 50-48 to confirm Kavanaugh in October 2018. U.S. Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia was the lone Democrat to vote in favor. If we take the hypothetical scenario of McGinty beating Toomey, and assume she would have followed Democratic Party lines, and all other senators would have voted in the same way as they actually did, the vote would have tied 49-49. That means that Pence could have cast a deciding vote. Other scenarios are equally hypothetical. A Facebook post said, Fact: Mike Bloomberg spent $12 million to re-elect a Senate Republican (Toomey) in 2016. Toomey beat a Dem (McGinty) by 1.5 points. If McGinty had won, Ds would have controlled the Senate after Doug Jones won and could have blocked Kavanaugh from the Supreme Court. Bloomberg did support Toomey and gave him significant funding. The rest of the claim is murky and relies on a hypothetical situation. Kavanaugh was confirmed in a 50-48 vote. If McGinty had won and all other things were the same, it likely would have ended up in a tie vote to be broken by Pence.",0.5,0.6,0.8,0.6,0.4,0.5,0.5,0.7,0.5,Half True

Final Rating: Half True  ",Says Newt Gingrich is responsible for the gridlocked politics of Washington.,"During an interview on the Dec. 5, 2011, edition of MSNBCs The Daily Rundown, David Axelrod, a senior campaign adviser to President Barack Obama, coined a new description for Republican presidential candidate and former House Speaker Newt Gingrich: the godfather of gridlock.Discussing a newly released Gingrich ad that portrays the former speaker in a soft light, Axelrod told host Chuck Todd that he was amused by the ad because he talked about (how) he was going to bring the country together to solve problems. You're talking about the godfather of gridlock here, the guy who two decades ago really invented the kind of tactics that have now become commonplace in Washington. So, this is a whole new Newt.We wondered whether it was really fair to pin todays policy gridlock on tactics engineered by Gingrich. So we sought comments from historians, political scientists and other political observers. We thought analyzing this quote might prove too subjective, but we found concrete evidence to both bolster and undermine Axelrod's claim. Gingrich the fighter Some historians and analysts say Gingrich's bare-knuckled tactics created a sharp partisanship that continues today.Gingrich came to national attention when he led a group of fellow backbenchers to challenge the ethics of House Speaker Jim Wright, D-Texas. Their challenge led Wright to resign in 1989, driving the ousted speaker to decry the mindless cannibalism consuming Congress.It was a watershed moment for Gingrich, and only solidified his belief that confrontation, not compromise, was what Congress needed.Beginning in 1989, Gingrich bided his time as House minority whip, serving under a more conciliatory Republican leader, Bob Michel of Illinois. By 1993 and 1994, -- when a Democratic president, Bill Clinton, was in the White House and the 40-year Democratic House majority was looking shaky -- Gingrich upped the ante.The Republican strategy in 1993 and 1994 was to vote as a parliamentary minority, in unison against the new president's initiatives, and that was as much or more Newt's idea as anybody's, said Norm Ornstein, a congressional scholar with the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank. Clinton's economic program, his first big initiative, took almost eight months to pass, denying him a big early victory and making the eventual passage look like a humiliation. The same approach had success with a crime bill and, of course, with health care reform.Michels impending retirement cleared the way for Gingrich to become speaker if the GOP managed to take over the House in the 1994 election. And they did.Once in office, Gingrich continued his confrontational strategy, most notably in the budget fights of 1995 that led to shutdowns of the federal government. Purdue University political scientist Bert A. Rockman cited Gingrich's defamatory misuse of the C-SPAN morning one-minute diatribes to an empty chamber, his over-the-top-rhetoric and his dogged pursuit of Clintons impeachment. Its become much worse, and for reasons hardly exclusive to any individuals nastiness, but Newt was a major contributor to the nastiness that prevails today.Gingrich developed wedge issues to divide the Democratic majority and magnets to pull voters into the Republican orbit, said Steve Gillon, a historian at the University of Oklahoma and author of The Pact: Bill Clinton, Newt Gingrich, and the Rivalry that Defined a Generation.University of Kansas political scientist Burdett Loomis argues that Gingrichs attacks on Congress itself have harmed the institution in the long term. Though Gingrich is a historian by training, Loomis said, he ignored the importance of maintaining (Congress) legitimacy, which has haunted us since.Gingrich the deal-makerBut Loomis and others also say Gingrich's legacy is not black and white. After Gingrich lost the public relations war over the shutdown to Clinton, he became more willing to compromise with his rival.What Axelrod's comment does not account for is the change that took place in Gingrich after the 1995 budget battle, Gillon said. Both Clinton and Gingrich realized they had more to gain by working together than they did by fighting each other. Both men saw their poll numbers rise.This period of cooperation lasted until the emergence of the Monica Lewinsky affair in 1998, which Gingrich played a significant role in promoting.So what did Clinton and Gingrich accomplish during this era of (relatively) good feelings? Here are a few notable bills, each of which passed with broad, bipartisan majorities.Telecommunications Act, 1996 -- described by the Federal Communications Commission as the first major overhaul of telecommunications law in almost 62 years. The House passed the final version of the bill by a 414-16 margin, with 236 Republicans and 178 Democrats supporting it.Welfare reform, 1996 -- a landmark bill to end cash payments and instead encourage recipients to find work. The House passed the final version of the bill by a 328-101 margin, with 230 Republicans and 98 Democrats.Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, 1996 -- a law that allowed people to change jobs without fearing the loss of their health insurance due to pre-existing conditions, as well as provisions dealing with health information privacy. The House passed the final version of the bill by a 421-2 margin, with 227 Republicans and 193 Democrats.Taxpayer Relief Act, 1997 -- which established a child tax credit, tuition tax credits, and penalty-free withdrawals from IRAs for education expenses and first-home purchases, as well as a decrease in the capital gains tax and limitations on the estate tax. The House passed the final version of the bill by a 389-43 margin, with 225 Republicans and 164 Democrats.Balanced Budget Act, 1997 -- a bill that cut spending in order to balance the budget by fiscal year 2002. The House passed the final version of the bill by a 346-85 margin, with 193 Republicans and 153 Democrats.At the presidential bill-signing ceremony on the South Lawn of the White House, Gingrich called for bipartisan leadership across the planet to put aside party differences and address other nagging problems that, like the deficit, worry the public, the Washington Times reported. We will meet the moral integrity test in peacetime of not spending our children's and grandchildren's money, he said. We have a chance over the next three and a half years to work together . . . to accomplish a lot.Overall, Newts four years as speaker can be characterized as gridlock followed by greased wheels, said Donald Wolfensberger, who served as the Republican staff director of the influential House Rules Committee before and during Gingrichs tenure as speaker. Wolfensberger is now director of the Congress Project at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars.Alan Abramowitz, an Emory University political scientist, agreed, and added that the Senate -- long the home of blocked nomination hearings and a filibuster rule that allows one senator to stand in the way of legislation -- has been at least as much a force for gridlock in Washington as the House. The Senate deserves far more blame for gridlock than the House, Abramowitz said.So Gingrich has been more of a prince of partisanship than a godfather of gridlock.Axelrod is mixing up apples and oranges, said John Feehery, a longtime House Republican spokesman who worked under then-House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., among others. Intense partisanship does not necessarily lead to gridlock, and gridlock is not necessarily the result of partisanship.Gillon, who wrote the book on the Clinton-Gingrich relationship, calls the former speaker a very complicated figure. He is a man who will use the most ruthless methods in order to gain power, but who can be restrained, creative, and bipartisan once he has power... The political people in the Clinton White House viewed Gingrich as the antichrist. But many of the policy people – Chief of Staff Leon Panetta, domestic policy adviser Bruce Reed, Chief of Staff Erskine Bowles – painted a portrait of a pragmatic, though temperamental, policymaker.Our rulingSo while Gingrich was sharply partisan, there are solid examples where he short-circuited gridlock to push bills to enactment.",0.5,0.5,1.0,0.5,0.3,0.5,0.5,1.0,0.5,Half True

Final Rating: Half True  ","Obamacare granted the protection against preexisting condition discrimination that extended to more than 150 million Americans, folks who get their health insurance through their employer.","During a recent appearance on MSNBC, Sen. Chris Coons (D-Del.) answered questions from Morning Joe co-host Mika Brzezinski about the latest lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of the Affordable Care Act. The most important part of Obamacare, as you know, Mika, is the protection against preexisting condition discrimination that extended to more than 150 million Americans, folks who get their health insurance through their employer, he said. Because, as almost everyone agrees, health care is complicated, we decided to take a closer look at Coons statement, especially because much has been written and said — and put in campaign ads — about how many Americans have preexisting health conditions and how they gained insurance protections under the ACA. We will not attempt to judge Sen. Coons assertion that the ACAs protection for people with preexisting conditions is the most important part of the law, although it is often mentioned along with the expansion of Medicaid to millions more Americans with low incomes. We started out by contacting Coons office to get the background information on his assertion, but didnt hear back. So, we moved on to examining the statutes and talking to various experts. First came HIPAA What we found out is what few people realize: Protections for preexisting conditions for most people with job-based insurance predated the ACA by more than a decade. The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, is best known for its provisions regarding medical privacy and patient access to their medical records. But the principal purpose of the law was to put an end to what was known as job lock. That happened when people with preexisting health conditions were afraid to leave one job with insurance for another job with insurance because the new insurance would not cover their condition, or would impose long waiting periods. HIPAA was a big advancement at the time in terms of protecting people with preexisting conditions who had employer coverage, said Sabrina Corlette, a research professor who studies health insurance at Georgetown University. Specifically, HIPAA required that as long as someone had been continuously covered by health insurance for at least 12 months, without a break longer than 63 days, new insurance at a new job could not impose waiting periods for a worker or family member. HIPAA also required insurers who sold policies in the small-group market to sell to all small groups, regardless of health status, and to cover every eligible member of the group, also regardless of health status. Most of the states had already attempted to address the job-lock problem by the mid-1990s, but states could not reach the majority of the population with health insurance because they were covered by the federal Employee Retirement Income Security Act, or ERISA. HIPAA basically ratified what most states had already done, said Joel Ario, a former Pennsylvania state insurance commissioner who helped implement the ACA for the federal government. HIPAA also tried to smooth the transition from employer-based insurance to individual coverage by requiring insurers to offer coverage to people who exhausted their post-employment COBRA benefits. (COBRA, short for the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act, was a 1986 law that allowed workers to continue to purchase their employer plans at full cost for up to 18 months.) But HIPAA did not address how much insurers could charge for those plans, and many insurance companies tried to deter enrollment by making premiums unaffordable for nearly anyone who qualified. While the group-to-individual conversion problem was the most glaring gap in HIPAA, it was not the only one. HIPAA did not require employers to offer health coverage nor did it require those who did offer coverage to offer a minimum package of benefits. Most of those gaps were addressed by the ACA. It effectively required large employers to provide a minimum package of benefits (or else pay a substantial fine). The ACA also, for the first time, required insurers to sell policies to individuals with preexisting conditions — without charging them more. Much of HIPAA was written into the health law, making the relationship between the two measures even more complicated. Our ruling In this statement, Coons suggested that that ACA provided pre-existing condition protections to the more than 150 million Americans who get their health coverage through their place of employment. But that is not completely correct.Those were already in place through HIPAA, though expanded by the ACA.",0.5,0.5,1,0.5,0,0,0.5,1,0.5,Half True

Final Rating: Half True  ",LeBrons I Promise School To Cost Taxpayers Millions Of Dollars Every Year,"An entertainment blog took a shot at LeBron James for not paying a fair share of the cost of his I Promise School in Akron, Ohio. Wannabe Entertainment published a story criticizing national media for not acknowledging that James isnt paying for the bulk of the schools costs. Its headline paints taxpayers as bearers of the burden for the school, which opened July 30. LeBrons I Promise School To Cost Taxpayers Millions Of Dollars Every Year, it says. Wannabe Entertainment is correct that taxpayers will pay millions of dollars for the school. However, the framing of the article could mislead readers to believe taxpayers will pay millions of dollars on top of what they were paying before, which is not the case. The first few paragraphs of the story are lifted straight from an Aug. 5 Cleveland Plain Dealer story. After that, the Wannabe Entertainment story switches to a diatribeabout Trump's tweeted critique of James and CNN's Don Lemon after an interview and the entire anti-Trump universe coming to the basketball star's defense. Its versiondoes not go on, as the Plain Dealer did, to credit James's investment. The I Promise School is a first-through-eighth grade public school that is part of the Akron Public School District. Because it is a public school, the LeBron James Family Foundation will foot a portion of the cost, but not the entire bill. This is a public school, Akron Public Schools spokesman Mark Williamson told PolitiFact. Taxpayers support all of our schools including this one. Public schools are funded by the state, property taxes and federal funds. So by law, the LeBron James Family Foundation cannot fully fund the school if it wanted to. The foundation pays for the additional services at the school that the other schools in the district do not have, including GED classes and job placement for parents, guest speakers and a food pantry. Stephanie Rosa, a spokeswoman for the LeBron James Family Foundation, told PolitiFact the foundation hasnt added up how much it contributed to the school. A $2 million rough estimate covered some building renovations, such as rewiring for technologyand staff hires for the family center. But the amount of money spent up until the day the school opened has not been made public. Before the opening of Jamess school, the I Promise program had been in Akron elementary schools for more than 10 years. There are 32 elementary schools and kids from all those schools were in the program but now in one location. Its not a new program, not new students, not even a new building, Williamson said. Point being, taxpayers were going to pay for the students whether or not James got involved. There are 46 schools in the Akron Public School District. Williamson said 35 of those schools have been rebuilt and during that time, the home of the current I Promise school served as the temporary school for those students who were displaced in that in-between time. For about 15 years, this building housed every student from every school that has been rebuilt, Williamson said. Williamson said the 240 students enrolled at I Promise were already in the program but in their respective elementary schools. All were doing is taking kids that we already support and putting them in a different location, he said. The cost of educating the students is consistent. So are the teachers salaries. The opening of this school puts all the students in the I Promise program under one roof from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., July through May. There are no additional costs because the district didnt hire any new teachers or recruit new students. A story on Wannabeent.com says, Lebrons I Promise School To Cost Taxpayers Millions Of Dollars Every Year. The headline and subsequent story might leave people thinking James school will be a drag on taxpayer resources. Buttaxpayers are paying the same amount of money theyd pay whether or not James got involved.Jamess foundation is funding enhancements meant to try to elevate students attending the school.

Final Rating: Half True  ","Says Nike pays factory workers, 80% of whom are women, 20 cents an hour and has them work 70 to 80 hours a week.","In September 2018, Nike announced an endorsement deal with former NFL quarterback and activist Colin Kaepernick. Since then, claims about the companys labor practices have flooded the internet, attracting thousands of shares on Facebook and Twitter. Many of these viral posts feature a photo of Nike factory workers accompanied by a claim that the company exploits workers with long hours and abysmally low wages. (Most posts are screenshots of a September 2018 tweet by conservative commentator Ryan Fournier.) The posts say: Just so I'm clear: These factory workers (which are 80% female) are making NIKE's for 20 cents an hour and working 70 to 80 hours a week, so NIKE can profit enough to pay Colin Kaepernick millions to speak out against oppression and injustice? The Associated Press photo accompanying the post is legitimate, though quite old. It shows Vietnamese workers putting finishing touches on Nike shoes at a factory in Ho Chi Minh City in February 2005. The posts were flagged as part of Facebooks efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) It is true that, at one time, Nike paid factory workers close to 20 cents per hour and that many worked over 10 hours a day, six days a week. While most of these numbers are now outdated, experts tell us that overseas factory workers for Nike (and most other major garment industry bands) continue to work long hours for low wages. Lets take a look. In October 1996, CBS 48 Hours news program aired an investigative report on the conditions of Nike factories in Vietnam. The segment revealed that factory workers, mostly women, worked six days a week for only $40 a month, which translated to about 20 cents an hour. An investigation by Dara ORourke, a researcher with the Transnational Resource and Action Center, followed in 1997 and reported several labor law violations at the Vietnamese Tae Kwang Vina plant, a factory that employed over 9,000 workers who produced 400,000 pairs of shoes a month for Nike. According to the investigation, the plants night-shift employees worked an average of 10.5 hours a day, six days per week at a monthly salary of $40. A 2003 World Bank report said Nike violated Vietnamese environmental and labor laws by exposing 10,000 workers at the Tae Kwang Vina plant to toxic solvents and forcing them to work above legal overtime limits. The report noted that the investigations, along with public outcry evoked by activists in Vietnam and the United States, prompted Nike to make improvements: Consequently, Nike took proactive measures and allowed independent auditing of the sweatshops. In 1999, Nike implemented its own Code of Conduct in Vietnamese factories. During recent years, there has been a visible improvement in VTs practices, such as safer work conditions and workers awareness of their rights and entitlements. PolitiFact reached out to the Clean Clothes Campaign, an alliance of labor unions that focuses on improving working conditions in the garment and sportswear industries. The organization told us that the numbers for the pay and hours, arent precise but the sentiment with regard to fair pay and treatment is correct: Factory workers for Nike –– and other major sportswear brands such as Adidas and Under Armour –– do not earn anywhere near a living wage. They confirmed that the claim of 80% of factory workers being women lines up with industry estimates, which have been as high as 85%. Clean Clothes also pointed us to a June 2019 report that surveyed top brands about their progress in implementing a living wage for workers and said most brands –– Nike included –– provided no evidence that their workers anywhere in the world were being paid a living wage. Research from 2014 shows that, in most of the Southeast Asian countries that Nike sources from, wages reach around 25% of a living wage. Paul Roeland, a campaign coordinator with the Clean Clothes Campaign, told PolitiFact that, when it comes to working hours, most workers have a contract to work 48 hours a week but regularly continue working beyond that, often up to 60 hours a week. He said the hours fluctuate and are often longer during peak production times. The factual numbers are shocking enough: it would come down to between 65-90 cents (USD) per hour (depending on the country), and regular 60-hour work weeks, Roeland told PolitiFact by email. That said, he bristled at the overall message in this viral post: At Clean Clothes Campaign, our aim is in supporting garment workers worldwide, as it has been over the past 30 years, Roeland said. However, we strongly believe that criticizing Nike's labour practices with the sole aim of disparaging the anti-racist activism of others, as some right-wing U.S. political figures are doing, is highly disingenuous. Garment workers deserve so much better than to be used as a handy argument in a social media meme. PolitiFact reached out to Nike for a response but did not hear back in time for publication. Nikes code of conduct for supplier facilities reads, the regular work week shall not exceed 48 hours and suppliers should allow workers at least 24 consecutive hours of rest in every seven-day period. All overtime work shall be consensual. Suppliers shall not request overtime on a regular basis and shall compensate all overtime work at a premium rate. Other than in extraordinary circumstances, the sum of regular and overtime hours in a week shall not exceed 60 hours. Its important to note that Nike isnt alone. While wages and hours for factory workers vary from country to country, many major companies use the same factories and all pay the same low wages for their workers. Experts tell us that while it depends on the country and the volume of production, violation of legal overtime standards is common in the garment industry. Viral social media posts claim that Nikes factory employees work 70 to 80 hours a week and get paid 20 cents an hour. The numbers in the post are outdated, but not entirely far off. Today, Nike pays workers more than 20 cents an hour and employees work, on average, a little less than 70 to 80 hours per week. However, workers rights experts tell us the pay from Nike and other major brands is still below a living wage and average weekly hours are routinely well above standard workweeks.",0.7,0.6,1.0,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.4,0.6,0.5,Half True

Final Rating: Half True","41,200 veterans in Florida dont have health care because Scott didnt expand Medicaid.","As Memorial Day approached, both Gov. Rick Scott and his anticipated Democratic rival Charlie Crist called on Veterans Administration Secretary Eric Shinseki to resign amid news reports that VA staff falsified documentation about how long veterans were waiting to receive health care. But then Crist pointed the finger at Scott in a series of tweets on May 22 and 23: • In addition -- if I were governor, I would take immediate action to make sure our veterans here in FL are getting the care they need. • Id call a special session to expand health care to the more than 41,000 FL vets who are left w/o coverage due to Scotts failure. • 41.2k vets in FL dont have health care because Scott didn't expand Medicaid. Unconscionable. It was that last tweet that caught our eye. We decided to fact-check the number Crist cited and whether they lack health care because Scott failed to expand Medicaid. Florida rejects Medicaid expansion Medicaid is an insurance program operated by states in partnership with the federal government to care for low-income people. The Affordable Care Act aimed to expand the program. Specifically, the law would cover all costs for the first three years for states to extend Medicaid to households earning up to 138 percent of the federal poverty level — which in 2013 was $15,865 for an individual, $32,499 for a family of four. Scott, who campaigned on his opposition to Obamacare, initially opposed Medicaid expansion. But in February 2013 he changed his position and came out in support of it. Scott didnt push the Republican-led Legislature to approve it, and ultimately legislators rejected it. The result is that now more than 800,000 uninsured Floridians earn too much to qualify for Medicaid but too little to qualify for subsidies to help buy insurance in the federal marketplace. Urban Institute study  About 40 percent of veterans nationwide are on VA care. Generally, veterans have to serve for two consecutive years and not be discharged dishonorably to be eligible for VA health care, which gives priority to those with service-related injuries or who are low income. Also, some veterans choose not to enroll in VA care, for example, if they dont live near any VA facilities. Some veterans who either arent eligible or choose not to enroll in VA could be eligible for Medicaid. In tweeting his attack, Crist linked to a March 2013 nationwide study by the Washington-based Urban Institute. The study analyzed U.S. Census Bureau data to estimate how many military veterans aged 19 to 64 dont have insurance. (Veterans 65 and older qualify, like other Americans, for Medicare.) The study found that 535,000 uninsured veterans nationwide would qualify for Medicaid or new subsidies under the Affordable Care Act. However, the majority would only qualify for Medicaid if their state chose to expand it. The institutes report said in Florida there were 103,700 non-elderly veterans who lacked health insurance, which included 41,200 who would qualify for Medicaid if the state expanded the program. We ran the study by Jack Tsai, an assistant professor of psychiatry at Yale who co-wrote a separate study about the number of uninsured veterans and Medicaid expansion, but didnt include a state-by-state breakdown. Tsai said that the methodology of the Urban Institute study is fairly solid. However, he noted it is based on data from a few years ago, and that Crists statement didnt include details about the studys limitations. There are various reasons why some veterans remain uninsured: Some might feel they dont need insurance or havent gotten around to obtaining it or may not be aware of their VA eligibility or dont want anything to go to the VA. Likewise, there might be similar reasons to not enroll with Medicaid, while others could be in between jobs. We asked spokespersons for the governors office and his campaign if they had any evidence to refute Crists claim. Campaign spokesman Greg Blair reiterated that Scott supported Medicaid but the Legislature didnt go along with it. He also pointed to 2011 Medicaid reform intended to lower the cost of health care. Our ruling Crist said in a tweet that 41,200 veterans in Florida dont have health care because Scott didnt expand Medicaid. Crists tweet linked to a map that cited the Urban Institute study showing the number of uninsured veterans in each state that might qualify for the Medicaid expansion. Crists tweet omits two major points: Some of those 41,200 veterans could get health care other ways. Its possible some are eligible for services through the VA but for a variety of reasons havent sought those benefits. Also, Scotts not solely responsible for Florida failing to expand Medicaid. After Scott opposed the expansion, he came out in support of it in February 2013. But Scott didnt lobby for it, and the Legislature rejected it last year.",0.5,0.6,0.8,0.5,0.4,0.5,0.5,0.7,0.6,Half True

Final Rating: Half True  ","The Bush administration has the Pentagon trying to take away the signing bonuses when a soldier gets wounded and ends up in the hospital, something that I'm working with a Republican senator to try to make sure never can happen again.","The dig by Sen. Hillary Clinton makes the Bush administration's treatment of wounded veterans seem almost so heartless as to be implausible. The Bush administration sends mixed messages, Clinton said during the Democratic debate in Las Vegas. They want to recruit and retain these young people to serve our country and then they have the Pentagon trying to take away the signing bonuses when a soldier gets wounded and ends up in the hospital, something that I'm working with a Republican senator to try to make sure never can happen again. The Army suggests this issue may all be a tempest in a political teapot, that it simply made a clerical error in asking a wounded vet to return a portion of his signing bonus. But there's another issue, one that may be a bit more legitimate: whether wounded soldiers ought to be guaranteed future installments of enlistment bonuses, bonuses pegged to future years of service they were not able to complete. In 2007, nearly 39,000 army recruits received an average of $16,500 in enlistment bonuses, according to Maj. Nathan M. Banks Sr. of the Department of the Army Public Affairs. The issue Clinton addresses was first raised in July 2007 by the bipartisan Dole-Shalala Commission, when, in the course of work with veterans and their families, they noticed that service members' remaining enlistment bonuses were not being paid when they were injured and medically retired or separated from active duty. The Defense Department assured the problem was fixed. In October 2007, Rep. Jason Altmire, D-Pa., introduced the Veterans Guaranteed Bonus Act to formally ensure that wounded veterans are paid the entirety of any signing bonus they were promised within 30 days after discharge for combat-related wounds. A Senate version of the bill was introduced by Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Ala., in November 2007. The Senate bill has 18 co-sponsors, including Clinton. The issue gathered steam that month when a Pittsburgh television station reported the story of Jordan Fox, an army private who was partially blinded in one eye from the explosion of a roadside bomb in Iraq. After Fox returned home with a medical discharge, he got a letter from the Army asking him to repay $2,800 of a $7,500 enlistment bonus. While Fox was held up by many politicians as Exhibit A in the case for the new legislation, his case also may have muddied the waters. The Army says it simply made an error in pay processing. Defense Department policy is clear: Bonuses already paid should not be recouped if injury or illness of the service member was not the result of the service member's misconduct. The Army contends Fox's was an isolated case. In fact, when it set up a hotline for pay problems, it received just two calls on that issue. So are we talking about legislation to fix a problem that may have affected just three people? As it relates to wounded soldiers having to return portions of paid bonuses, perhaps. And certainly a lot of politicians made a lot of political hay about that. But that's different than unpaid, future installments of bonuses. Say a soldier who got a $10,000 up-front bonus, and was promised an additional $5,000 at the end of each of three years of completed duty. If he was injured and medically discharged in his first year of service, would he get the final two years of unpaid bonuses? Defense Department policy there is less clear. The secretary of the Military Department may decide to pay the soldier unpaid installments if he or she determines that not paying would be against equity and good conscience, or contrary to the best interests of the United States. The legislation Clinton co-sponsored would require the military to pay all future installments upon medical discharge. No one knows, still, how many wounded veterans this may affect. The Congressional Budget Office informally told congressional staffs that the proposed legislation — to include unpaid installments — might cost about $1-million a year. That may seem like a lot of money, but considering the number of wounded vets, it doesn't suggest they think this is a widespread, institutional problem. The Senate bill seeks an accounting by the military to find out. So while Clinton highlights a legitimate issue — paying future installments of enlistment bonuses even after wounded veterans have been discharged — her wording is somewhat misleading, suggesting wounded veterans are being forced to return bonus money. There is little evidence to suggest that happened to more than a couple veterans, and the Army admitted its mistake. Also misleading is her suggestion that there was some kind of Bush administration effort to deny future bonus payments promised to wounded vets. But she may be right that some were denied future bonus payments (although it is far from clear that this is still happening), and the legislation co-sponsored by Clinton would make it crystal clear they are to be paid.

Final Rating: Half True  ",Joe Biden's sanctions on Russia are riddled with loopholes and don't even start for 30 days. They have carve outs for the energy and financial sectors.,"In ads for their 2022 campaigns, some Republicans are attacking President Joe Bidens sanctions on Russia as too slow and too weak. One ad is in the race for an open Senate seat in Ohio, which could help determine which party controls the Senate. Biden's sanctions are riddled with loopholes and don't even start for 30 days, investment banker Mike Gibbons said in his ad on Facebook and Instagram. They have carve outs for the energy and financial sectors. The claim is a mixed bag: Some of the sanctions took immediate effect, some were phased in over 30 days. The energy sector was largely spared, but banks were targeted directly. Russia invaded Ukraine Feb. 24, but the United States began imposing sanctions two days earlier, in response to Russias deployment of troops into two pro-Russian regions of eastern Ukraine. The Feb. 22 sanctions focused on two major Russian state-owned financial institutions, imposed restrictions on Russian sovereign debt and sanctioned five Kremlin-connected elites, according to the U.S. Treasury Department. The Feb. 24 sanctions, according to a Treasury Department news release, targeted all of Russias largest financial institutions and the ability of state-owned and private entities to raise capital — and further bars Russia from the global financial system. Gibbons ad cited that news release. In all, between Feb. 22 and March 3, the U.S. imposed 148 sanctions on Russia, according to a running list produced by CORRECTIV, a nonprofit investigative newsroom in Germany. In announcing the Feb. 24 sanctions, Biden said some effects were immediate, but he also alluded to 30 days in terms of assessing their effects. Weve cut off Russias largest bank — a bank that holds more than one-third of Russias banking assets by itself — cut it off from the U.S. financial system, Biden said. He added: The sanctions we imposed exceed anything thats ever been done. The sanctions we imposed have generated two-thirds of the world joining us. They are profound sanctions. Lets have a conversation in another month or so to see if theyre working. Navin Bapat, a professor of peace and war in political science at the University of North Carolina, said the Feb. 24 sanctions provided for a period of 30 days to allow U.S. financial institutions to wind down their transactions. But the Feb. 22 sanctions took effect more quickly. They prohibited U.S. institutions from participating in purchasing rubles or any other assets from Russian financial institutions after March 1, Bapat said. Gibbons campaign cited clauses in the sanctions that allow exceptions for certain financial transactions, including some related to the energy industry. The Biden administration, facing the possibility that energy sanctions could lead to higher gas prices in the United States and energy prices abroad, has acknowledged that the energy sector was not a major target. Daleep Singh, a deputy national security advisor and deputy director of the National Economic Council, said at a news conference on the Feb. 24 sanctions: To be clear: Our sanctions are not designed to cause any disruption to the current flow of energy from Russia to the world. Weve carved out energy payments on a time-bound basis to allow for an orderly transition of these flows away from sanctioned institutions, and weve provided other licenses to provide for an orderly winddown of business. Republican and Democratic lawmakers have moved to stop the U.S. from importing oil from Russia. Alan Cole, a former economist with Congress Joint Economic Committee and former adviser to U.S. Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, wrote in an article cited by Gibbons campaign that while the sanctions are an impressive effort overall, the sanctions also have a glaring weakness: They largely spare Russias all-important energy sector, the backbone of its entire economy, and its agricultural center — the country is a major wheat exporter. Russia expert Harley Balzer, an emeritus professor of government and international affairs at Georgetown University, told PolitiFact that Biden is endeavoring to balance punishing Russia and preventing serious damage in Europe from rising energy prices and threatened supplies. The financial sanctions are causing havoc on the Russian stock market, causing the market cap of major Russian firms to drop more than 90% on foreign exchanges and clobbering the ruble, he added. Freezing the Russian Central Bank assets abroad reduced their reserves from $600 billion to $300 billion. They are spending $5 billion to $10 billion per day to keep the ruble from depreciating even more. Cronies' assets are being confiscated at an increasing pace. All of that has far more immediate impact than the oil and gas sanctions. Other Republicans have run ads similar to Gibbons. Rep. Ted Budd, who is running for the U.S. Senate in North Carolina, and Georgia U.S. House candidate Alan Sims both said the sanctions were too little, too late; Jeffrey Sossa-Paquette, who is running for a U.S. House in Massachusetts, said the sanctions leave out gas and oil. The Ohio Senate seat Gibbons wants is open because the incumbent, Republican Rob Portman, is not seeking reelection. Both the GOP and the Democratic Senate primaries, to be held May 3, are contested. Besides Gibbons, the Republican candidates include Ohio state Sen. Matt Dolan; former Ohio state treasurer Josh Mandel; former Ohio Republican Party chair Jane Timken; and Hillbilly Elegy author J.D. Vance. The leading Democratic candidate is U.S. Rep. Tim Ryan. Overall, the Ohio race is rated variously by campaign watchers as lean Republican, as likely Republican and solid Republican. Gibbons said Biden's sanctions on Russia are riddled with loopholes and don't even start for 30 days. They have carve outs for the energy and financial sectors. Some of the sanctions made a quick impact and some were phased in over 30 days. The energy sector was largely spared, but banks were targeted directly.",0.5,0.5,1,0.5,0,0.5,0.5,1,0.5,Half True

Final Rating: Half True  ","Since 2000, Texas has reduced harmful pollutants in the air like nitrogen oxide by 62.5 percent, and ozone by 23 percent--a reduction that is 12 percent greater than the national average.","Gov. Rick Perry visited a familiar boast about the clearing skies of Texas in a May 19, 2014, letter to President Barack Obama that may have tested possible themes of another gubernatorial run for president. Saying Texas employs an all-of-the-above energy strategy tapping fossil fuels plus solar, biofuel and wind resources, Perry wrote: Even as our population has grown by more than 5 million since 2000, we've led the U.S. energy revolution while protecting our environment and reducing harmful pollutants in the air like nitrogen oxide by 62.5 percent, and ozone by 23 percent — a reduction that is 12 percent greater than the national average. 62, 23, 12 — sounds like a quarterbacks call before the snap. We were curious about his numbers. Is Perry right about the pollution reductions as well as the cuts outpacing decreases nationally? A 2010 fact check Perry made a similar claim in June 2010, saying in a press release the Texas clean air program (has) achieved a 22 percent reduction in ozone and a 46 percent decrease in NOx (nitrogen oxide) emissions. Hed earlier cited the same statistic in a letter to Obama. Half True, we found then. Perry accurately recapped improvements in ozone levels. But as for the NOx emissions contributing to ozone levels, his statistic included only one NOx source — industrial — which he did not note. Notably, nearly three-quarters of NOx emissions come from other sources. Also, whether state government merited credit for the improvements struck us as worthy of pause. Even if the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality was responsible for the drop in industrial NOx emissions, federal efforts — in particular, vehicle emission regulations — were a key factor. Significantly, too, the state's ozone-related programs existed to help Texas comply with federal expectations. As noted then, a goal of the federal Clean Air Act is to reduce the levels of what the Environmental Protection Agency calls commonly found air pollutants. Among those is ground-level ozone, which forms when nitrogen oxide emissions mix with volatile organic compounds in sunlight and heat. Common sources of nitrogen oxides: cars and trucks, power plants and industrial boilers. EPA sets limits on the concentration of ozone, the primary component of smog, in the air. Areas that fail to meet the standard are designated in nonattainment. Under the Clean Air Act, the state is required to submit plans to EPA that outline how it will clean up areas and meet the federal standard. Figures hold up As in 2010, we asked David T. Allen, a University of Texas professor of chemical engineering, about Perrys statement. By email, Allen noted that per figures posted online by the TCEQ, Perrys analysis holds up. Allen also pointed out an EPA web page indicating that nationally ozone levels in 2012 were down 9 percent compared to 2000 with NOx levels down 29 to 50 percent, depending on the measurement applied. Separately by email, commission spokesman Terry Clawson sent us a spreadsheet he described as the basis of the charts. Clawson said the data came from the EPA. Lets recap the charted changes in ozone, then NOx. Ozone down 23 percent According to a commission chart on a web page last updated April 17, 2014, ozone in Texas decreased 23 percent from 2000 through 2012, as Perry said. (The comparisons reflect what officials call fourth-high ozone readings. Clawson emailed us this technical explanation.) A headline on the chart says the ozone decrease for the other 49 states averaged 11 percent. Texas ran 12 percentage points ahead of that. The chart shows ozone decreasing in all but a few states--Wyoming, Utah, Idaho, Montana, South Dakota, Hawaii and Alaska--with the drop in Texas bested only by Tennessee, California and Georgia.  Source: Web page, Air Quality Successes - Criteria Pollutants, Texas Commission on Environmental Quality, last updated April 17, 2014 (accessed May 21, 2014) NOx from industrial sources down 62.5 percent In the period, Allen emailed, industrial emissions of NOx (not including motor vehicles) in Texas dropped 62.5 percent. He pointed out a commission chart indicating that industrial NOx emissions of more than 300,000 xx tons in 2011 compared to a shade less than 800,000 xx tons per year in 2000, which works out to a 62.5 percent reduction, as Perry said.  Source: Web page, Air Quality Successes - Emissions Inventory, Texas Commission on Environmental Quality, last updated April 17, 2014 (accessed May 21, 2014) Sierra Club stresses federal role For another perspective, we turned to Neil Carman of the Lone Star chapter of the Sierra Club. By phone, Carman called Perrys figures accurate though he suggested the cited reductions occurred mainly thanks to federal laws and enforcement. Carman, director of the clubs Clean Air program, said the federal government still considers the multi-county Houston and Dallas-Fort Worth areas as not attaining minimum ozone standards. He pointed out a Sierra Club press release stating the club on May 20, 2014, filed suit against the EPA for failing to classify Dallas-Fort Worth as having a severe ozone problem, an action that would have required polluters to clean the air, the press release says. By email, Carman said the governor's claim misleads by lumping together Texas' ozone woes in Houston and Dallas-Fort Worth with all the other ozone areas in the nation, including areas that have minimal or no problems. A comparison to other states with few ozone problems is roughly analogous to comparing a driver who gets 30 speeding tickets a year and reduces it by 50% over ten years to 15 per year, Carman said, while a second driver only had 3 tickets and reduces it by 33% to 2 tickets per year. The first driver had the greatest (percentage) reduction at 50% and the greatest volume reduction but also had the worst speeding record. Earlier, Clawson indicated the gains noted by Perry werent entirely due to federal oversight. By email, he noted a 1999 Texas law that required power plants to reduce NOx emissions, also saying other state laws enacted since 2000 stressed energy efficiency, reductions in pollution and renewable energy sources like wind power. Clawson, asked about the bulk of NOx pollution coming from vehicles and non-industrial sources, which Perrys statement did not take up, said NOx emissions from non-industrial sources in Texas in 2011 were 42 percent less than what such sources emitted in 1999. Our ruling Perry said that since 2000, Texas has reduced harmful pollutants in the air like nitrogen oxide by 62.5 percent, and ozone by 23 percent— a reduction that is 12 percent greater than the national average. Those figures are accurate, but the claim (like Perrys 2010 statement) takes into account only one NOx source — industrial — which it failed to note. Nearly three-quarters of NOx emissions come from other sources. Perrys declaration also didn't reflect on federal laws and oversight that figure into pollution reductions. Texas didnt make the gains in isolation. HALF TRUE – The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context.

Final Rating: Half True  ",Says his opponent Dorman Grace brags on his Facebook page about receiving illegal campaign contributions.,"One of the most talked-about political ads of the primary election season comes courtesy of a relatively obscure race: the Republican primary for the Alabama Commissioner of Agriculture and Industries.It's the tough-talking, rifle-toting Dale Cowboy Peterson who propels the ad to an instant classic. To date, the ad has been viewed more 1.2 million times on YouTube. In it, Peterson aims his most pointed verbal attack against Republican primary opponent Dorman Grace.Dorman Grace brags on his Facebook page about receiving contributions from industries he would regulate. Bragging about receiving illegal money on Facebook. Who on earth would support such a dummy?It's one thing to call your opponent a dummy. It's another to call him a cheat. And so we decided to check out Peterson's claim that Grace was guilty of taking illegal campaign contributions. And then bragging about it on Facebook.Campaign finance reports submitted to the Alabama Secretary of State, and viewable online, show that Grace has taken contributions from several farms. Among them, deer and poultry farms. And on his Facebook page, Grace thanked some of the supporters who have contributed to his campaign, including some of the farmers in question.So are the contributions illegal?In 1998, the Alabama Legislature passed a law to prohibit the Commissioner of the Department of Agriculture and Industries or a candidate for the office of commissioner from accepting campaign contributions from persons associated with businesses regulated by the department.The contributions to Grace have given rise to several complaints with the state Ethics Commission -- not by Peterson -- but the commission has yet to rule on them.He's no expert on election laws, Peterson said in a phone interview with PolitiFact, but this seems pretty cut and dry.You can readily see that industries that we regulate, he's accepting money from them, Peterson said.End of story? Not necessarily.The Grace campaign says it has done nothing wrong because the contributions to the campaign don't come from industries regulated by the agriculture commissioner.Tullie Culverhouse, campaign manager for Grace, contends the law was intended to bar contributions from agencies regulated by the ag commissioner, such as fertilizer and pest control companies which have to come to the department for a permit to operate in Alabama.Poultry farms are not regulated by the department, Culverhouse said. They are serviced by the department. The only thing they do is serve the industry with disease control. This is frivolous.So those are the competing opinions of the two campaigns.We spoke with Glen Zorn, the assistant ag commissioner and Democratic candidate for the top agriculture job. Zorn doesn't think it would be accurate to say, for example, that poultry farms are regulated by thecommissioner. He hasn't taken any money from any poultry farmers, he said, but he would.The law about not accepting contributions from persons associated with businesses regulated by the department has never been tested, and remains a gray area, said Jeff Webb, legal advisor to the Agriculture Commissioner.We can go on anyone's property that is growing hens and make sure they are following all of the mandates to prevent outbreaks of infectious or contagious disease, Webb said. And so, he said, There is an argument that they are regulated by us.But there's a pretty good argument in the other direction, too, he said.Ray Hilburn, Poultry Program Director for the Alabama Department of Agriculture, said he doesn't view the department's role as a regulator of poultry farms.We regulate diseases, he said. We do disease work. We make sure the birds are disease-free. But we don't regulate the poultry growers themselves, in my opinion.Ultimately, it appears the state Ethics Commission is going to have to decide whether these contributions were improper (and it seems unlikely we'll hear a decision before next month's Republican primary). But we think it's fair to say that when the state's poultry program director and the legal advisor to the Alabama Department of Agriculture say the law is untested and unclear, it's a bit of a gray area. And so we rule Peterson's statement Half True.",0.5,0.5,1.0,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,Half True

Final Rating: Half True  ","Says the average Ohio student graduates from a four-year college or university with nearly $27,000 in tuition debt.","Editor's note: We originally rated this claim True. After receiving feedback from readers, we have downgraded that rating to Half True because the claim applies the average debt of about $27,000 to a much broader group than did the study from which it was cited. Interest rates on federally subsidized student loans went on the front burner as a political issue after Mitt Romney followed President Obama in saying he did not want those rates to go up. Congressional Republicans -- who earlier passed a budget allowing the rates to double in July to their 2007 rate of 6.8 percent -- closed ranks behind their presumptive presidential nominee.They voted for a hastily introduced bill that would keep the rate at 3.4 percent, and pay for it with funds intended for preventive health care programs under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.Raiding that fund made the legislation unpalatable for Democrats -- just as the Democratic proposals to extend the lower interest rates were unpalatable to Republicans.One of the proposals would have paid for the college loan subsidies by ending tax subsidies for oil and gas companies. Another would end a payroll tax exemption given some business owners.Ohio's Sen. Sherrod Brown was a co-sponsor of the latter bill and of earlier legislation to stop the loan rates from going up.Federally-subsidized Stafford loans have allowed thousands of students—who might not otherwise be able pay for to college—afford the ever-increasing cost of higher education, he said in a news release. With the average Ohio student graduating from a four-year institution with nearly $27,000 in tuition bills, the last thing we should be doing is adding to their already-heavy debt load.The figure of $27,000 caught the notice of PolitiFact Ohio. It is more than $6,700 per year for four years of school.We asked Brown's office for his source and more information. They referred us to the Project on Student Debt, a project of the independent, nonprofit Institute for College Access and Success.Its most recent survey of public and private four-year institutions in Ohio found that 68 percent of students graduate in debt, and that the average debt on college loans is $27,713 -- the 7th-highest statewide average in the nation. (New Hampshire was highest, with average debt of $31,048; Wyoming was lowest, with $20,571.)The actual debt level is probably higher, the Project on Student Debt noted, because the data is voluntarily reported by colleges and not available for all of them.The report also reflects only graduates of public and private nonprofit colleges because few for-profit colleges report the student debt data. Based on national surveys by the U.S. Department of Education, graduates of for-profit four-year colleges are much more likely to borrow student loans, and borrow significantly more, than counterparts at nonprofit institutions.Nationally, according to a report from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, the average student loan balance per borrower is $23,300. The median balance is roughly half of that, $12,800. About one-quarter of borrowers nationally owe more than $28,000, and about 10 percent owe more than $54,000, according to the New York Fed.In aggregate, the bank said, the outstanding student loan balance now stands at about $870 billion, surpassing the nations total credit card balance ($693 billion) and the total auto loan balance ($730 billion). About 37 million people hold outstanding student loan debt.The key with all these figures is that they deal specifically with students who borrow and then graduate with loan debt.So how does that mesh with Browns claim? In his statement he said the average Ohio student graduating from a four-year institution. That describes a bigger pool of people than just the students who graduate with debt. In that most recent survey it would also include the 32 percent of the graduates who had no debt. But the figure Brown cited, nearly $27,000, was an average covering just those students who graduated with debt.Browns statement is partially accurate. He cites the correct figure from a survey on debt among college students. But he describes those affected by debt too broadly, applying the average to all rather than just those who graduate with loan balances. Including all students would lower the average for loan debt by about a third. Thats an important detail needed to fully understand Browns claim.On the Truth-O-Meter, Browns statement rates as Half True.",0.6,0.6,1.0,0.7,0.0,0.2,0.5,1.0,0.5,Half True

Final Rating: Half True","Says Kansas U.S. House candidate Paul Davis was caught with a stripper during a drug raid and later voted to allow strip clubs to open near homes, churches, schools and daycare facilities.","A new ad from the Congressional Leadership Fund, a super PAC working to protect the GOP Majority in the U.S. House, attacks a Kansas congressional hopeful for an incident at a strip club 20 years ago. You bet we wanted to see if the facts here stood up to scrutiny. Democrat Paul Davis is locked in a competitive race with Republican Steve Watkins in Kansas 2nd Congressional District, a seat that includes Topeka, Lawrence and the communities west of Kansas City. The ad targets Davis for his alleged involvement in a 1998 strip club drug raid, where he was found in a dark room with a nearly naked woman. Whats worse than getting caught at a strip club during a drug bust? Ask Paul Davis. The ad then claims Davis was found in a VIP room with a woman wearing only a G-string.Then it says, Even worse, after Davis was caught with a stripper, he voted to allow strip clubs to open near our homes, churches, schools and even daycare facilities. Shady Paul Davis cant be trusted. Here, we are checking the details surrounding the strip club incident, along with the claim that Davis voted to allow strip clubs to operate near places like schools, homes, churches and daycares. The situation involving Davis and a strip club came to light in September 2014 during his bid for governor, which he lost. According to reports, Davis was getting a lap dance in a back room in the late 1990s when cops raided the club in search of drugs. He was not charged with a crime, but police involved in the raid reported he was found in a compromising position. Davis said he was at the wrong place at the wrong time. Independence Police Chief Harry Smith later corroborated Davis account that the candidate was not involved in any wrongdoing, or, to his knowledge, the focus of an investigation. He said Davis was questioned briefly before being released. Kelsi Browning, a spokeswoman for Davis campaign, told PolitiFact that the ad is based on something that happened 20 years ago when Davis was 26. As a new lawyer, she said, Daviswent with his boss to meet an unsavory client of the law firm. The ad refers to HB 2107, or the Community Defense Act, which was a 2011 state bill that would have prohibited strip clubs and other sexually oriented businesses from being established within 1,000 feet of the property line of an existing one as well as any schools, churches, public parks, residences, libraries or daycare centers. The bill would have also required semi-nude dancers to remain at least 6 feet away from their customers and for sexually oriented businesses to remain closed from midnight to 6 a.m. Davis was one of 28 Kansas House members who voted against the bill, which ultimately failed in the Senate. The Davis campaign says that the legislation was a perennial bill thatrarely made it out of committee. When it first came up in 2010, Davis actually voted for the bill before it was struck down in the Senate. It came up again in the 2011 session, but this time, he voted against it. Critics of the legislation, which included Davis, argued at the time that regulating these businesses was best left to cities and counties. Some also questioned taking the time to focus on the issue when the state was facing a massive budget deficit. In a Lawrence Journal-World story around the time of the vote, Davis, who was the House minority leader, was quoted saying that the Legislature was probably intruding in areas where we dont need to be. Weve got a lot more important things that we need to be dealing with here. The Congressional Leadership Fund ad says that Kansas U.S. House candidate Paul Davis was caught with a stripper during a drug raid and later voted to allow strip clubs to open near homes, churches, schools and daycares. The ad is piecing together two unrelated issues to draw an unsavory conclusion, while embellishing parts of the story. Davis did not vote to allow strip clubs to open near schools, churches, daycares and the like. He once voted against a measure that would have banned them from opening near these places. He also once voted for the same proposal. The ads claim that he was found in a strip club during a drug raid is accurate, but any suggestion he was connected to the drug raid is misplaced. Overall, this claim is partially accurate but takes things out of context.",0.5,0.8,0.9,0.6,0.7,0.8,0.5,0.8,0.6,Half True
