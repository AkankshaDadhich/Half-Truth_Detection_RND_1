Final Rating: False  ",The boilermakers union has endorsed me because I sat down with them and went into great detail with leadership [about] exactly what I would do.,"When asked to prove his support for fracking is genuine, Joe Biden said last week that hed won the backing of the boilermakers, a union whose members depend on the natural gas industry and passionately support the controversial drilling technique. The boilermakers union has endorsed me because I sat down with them and went into great detail with leadership [about] exactly what I would do, Biden said Thursday in Philadelphia during a nationally televised ABC News town hall. Thats not true. Biden hasnt been endorsed by the International Brotherhood of Boilermakers — which represents 50,000 people across the country who work in heavy industry, manufacturing, and related sectors — or Local 154, the Pittsburgh-area chapter mentioned at the event. The international union states clearly on its website that it hasnt endorsed a candidate for president this cycle. The International Brotherhood of Boilermakers has not endorsed any U.S. Presidential candidate for the 2020 Election, and the information contained on this webpage in no way serves as an endorsement by the International Brotherhood of Boilermakers for any U.S. Presidential candidate. A note on the website continues: As a union boilermaker, your vote is a personal decision. You have the right to vote for candidates and issues as you so choose. Your vote can make a difference in electing the representatives and policymakers who support labor issues and advocate for the work boilermakers do. Local union lodges arent bound by what the larger umbrella group does, and in September, Local 154 endorsed President Donald Trump. The other day I'm watching the debate and I see Joe Biden tell everybody that the boilermakers endorsed him and that is not true, said John Hughes, Local 154s business manager. He said he talked to somebody. I'd like to know who he talked to in the boilermakers because anybody I talk to did not endorse him. Asked for evidence that Biden spoke with members of the boilermakers union, Andrew Bates, the Biden campaigns director of rapid response, provided none. Instead he listed several other Pennsylvania unions Biden met with and won endorsements from while campaigning, such as Teamsters Local 249, United Association of Plumbers Local 27, and Pennsylvania AFL-CIO. Bates added that the boilermakers endorsed Joe Biden twice. Hes talking about the 2008 and 2012 election cycles, when the union endorsed President Barack Obama, and Joe Biden was his running mate. But an Obama endorsement doesnt automatically count as a Biden nod. The Democratic nominating contest was still in full swing in February 2008 when the boilermakers union threw its support behind Obama. Not only had Obama not yet named Biden as his running mate, but Biden was still seeking the nomination himself and had been passed over for the endorsement. The endorsement the boilermakers made in 2012 when Obama was running for reelection could more plausibly be described as support for an Obama-Biden ticket. The boilermakers union came up at the town hall when Pittsburgh resident Michele Ellison asked Biden to describe his vision for the energy sector in Southwestern Pennsylvania, where fracking has lifted the economy and employed plenty of boilermakers but also sickened some residents who live near the wells that extract natural gas from miles beneath the Earths surface. Before answering the question, Biden emphasized, as he has said repeatedly, that he does not want to ban fracking. He wants to block the federal government from issuing new permits for drilling on public land but would otherwise allow existing fracking operations to continue, with environmental safeguards in place. He went on to say that he wants to invest in renewable energy and the battery technology needed to store it. Biden said the boilermakers union has endorsed me. There are several things wrong with this statement. First, the International Brotherhood of Boilermakers hasnt endorsed a candidate for president this cycle. Second, Local 154, the Pittsburgh area chapter mentioned during the town hall, endorsed Trump. Third, the boilermakers did not endorse Biden twice in the past as his campaign said. And fourth, the Biden campaign provided no evidence that he sat down with the unions leaders as he said. Bidens statement is not accurate.",0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,false

Final Rating: False  ",A horrible law requires that children be separated from their parents once they cross the Border into the U.S.,"President Donald Trump wrongly blamed Democrats for his own administrators immigration policy. Put pressure on the Democrats to end the horrible law that separates children from there (sic) parents once they cross the Border into the U.S., Trump tweeted. Trump recently told Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen, I know what you're going through right now with families is very tough, but those are the bad laws that the Democrats gave us. We have to break up families. But there is no law that mandates separating children from their parents. Trumps own administration devised a policy to that effect. So what is Trump talking about? Whenever parents are charged with a federal misdemeanor (entry without inspection in this case), or awaiting trial, they are placed in the custody of the U.S. Marshals Service. Children cannot go to jail, so they are transferred to the custody of Health and Human Services Office of Refugee Resettlement. They are then placed with relatives, juvenile detention centers or foster care. Thats a longstanding Homeland Security policy, DHS told us. Before the Trump administration, immigrants entering illegally as families were rarely prosecuted, said Sarah Pierce, an associate policy analyst of the U.S. Immigration Program at the Migration Policy Institute. Instead, immigrants were held in family detention centers until they were sent to appear before an immigration court or deported. Attorney General Jeff Sessionsannounced on April 6 the Homeland Security Department would now be referring all illegal border crossings to the Justice Department for prosecution. Facing criminal charges, parents would go to detention centers, leaving their children unaccompanied. Its the decision to prosecute parents that is causing the separations. Thats a choice they have made thats largely different from what other administrations have done, said Peter Margulies, an immigration law and national security law professor at Roger Williams University School of Law. When we asked for evidence of policies separating families, the White House referred us to items determining what happens to unaccompanied immigrant minors. But none of the children in question would be deemed unaccompanied if the Trump administration did not decide to prosecute their parents. The 1997 Flores Settlement Agreement, for example, calls for the release of unaccompanied minors to family members or sponsors who can care for them as their immigration case is resolved. The Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of 2008, which Trump has wrongly called a Democrat rule, determines that unaccompanied minors be transferred to Health and Human Servicescustody. The White House argued such policies encourage parents to send their children into the United States, knowing they will be promptly released. The cruel and inhumane open borders policies of the Democratic Party are responsible for encouraging mass illegal migration, enabling horrendous child smuggling, and releasing violent MS-13 gang members into American communities, White House deputy press secretary Hogan Gidley said in an emailed statement. The Trump administration may believe that Democrats are responsible for policies that encourage illegal border crossing, but we found no law mandating that children be separated from their parents. Trump said a horrible law requires that children be separated from their parents once they cross the Border into the U.S. There is no such law. The Homeland Security Departments longstanding policy is to separate children from their custodians when they are referred for criminal prosecution. Trumps administration has decided to prosecute all illegal crossings. Families were rarely prosecuted under previous administrations.",0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,false

Final Rating: False  ",President Obama gave Egypt's Muslim Brotherhood one and a half billion dollars.,"Foreign policy was one of the issues that came up when U.S. Senate candidate Benjamin Barry Hinckley was interviewed on State of the State, a cable television public affairs program that aired April 21 and 22.Hinckley, a Republican, was critical of foreign aid, and specifically questioned one of the aid decisions of the Obama administration. He was struggling a bit as he made his point, but here's what he said:Obama gave the Muslim Brotherhood a million [then correcting himself] a billion and a half dollars last week, you know, in Egypt. We need that money here. A billion and a half dollars could really help Rhode Island, quite frankly. We probably need it, in my opinion, more than the Muslim Brotherhood needs it . . . especially when the Muslim Brotherhood got together, I think one of the first things they did, when they convened their new congress, was to make Israel enemy #1. And we give them a billion and a half dollars? That's a problem in my book. We need to focus our resources here.The Muslim Brotherhood has been a part of Egyptian politics -- sometimes an outlawed part -- since 1928; one of its goals is to promote Sharia law, which is the moral code and religious law of Islam.Did the Obama administration really give the Brotherhood $1.5 billion?It turns out that the money was actually an aid package to Egypt itself, not the Brotherhood, according to a March 22 story in The Washington Post.We contacted Hinckley's campaign.Spokesman Christopher McAuliffe said Hinckley is aware that there is a pro forma difference between the Muslim Brotherhood and the government of Egypt. In that light, his position could certainly have been more precise. However, I do think the basis of it is readily understandable, since the Egyptian government is dominated by the Muslim Brotherhood.For guidance on that point, we contacted some experts on Egypt.Melani Cammett, director of the Middle East studies program at Brown University, told us that sending aid to Egypt was not the same as giving it to the Brotherhood because the Brotherhood doesn't actually control the government.It's true that the Muslim Brotherhood won the plurality of seats [in December elections] and when you combine them with the Salafis, which are more radical Islamists, they've won the majority of seats in the parliament, she said. The fact of the matter is the SCAF, which is the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces, still controls the government and controls the executive branch and is manipulating things in such a way that it's making it difficult for the Islamists to exert their full power as the majority in parliament.So the major struggle going on in Egyptian politics right now is that the SCAF, controlled by elite military officers, is not willing to relinquish power, said Cammett.John P. Entelis, director of Middle East studies at Fordham University, said it would be totally inaccurate to say that $1.5 billion is going to the Muslim Brotherhood. This is an ongoing military aid package that we've been giving to Egypt since 1979.The aid package, according to multiple sources, includes $1.3 billion in military aid and $250 million in economic and political assistance.Our rulingRepublican U.S. Senate candidate Barry Hinckley said the Obama administration approved $1.5 billion to go to Egypt's Muslim Brotherhood.In fact, the aid package was for the nation of Egypt, not the Brotherhood. The Brotherhood may control the largest bloc of seats in parliament, but it's not even a majority. Not only that, the country itself continues, for now at least, to be controlled by the military. And more than 80 percent of the aid package is military aid.(Get updates from PolitiFactRI on Twitter.

Final Rating: False  ",Kobe Bryants untimely death has been planned for a while.,"Former NBA player Kobe Bryant, his 13-year-old daughter and seven other people were killed on Jan. 26 when the helicopter they were riding in crashed in Calabasas, Calif. Online, some people are claiming that the crash wasnt an accident. We already debunked one Facebook post that suggested Bryant was murdered. Now, were looking at an Instagram post that claims Bryants death was planned. After LeBron James passes Kobe on the all time NBA scoring list, Kobes personal helicopter crashes only a day later, the Jan. 26 post says. LeBron has to hit the 33,644 point mark to pass Kobe Bryant & become the NBAs 3rd highest scorer in history. The 33 is significant. The 6 is significant. And Ive been speaking on the importance of the 44 ritual in pro sports for months now. To me, this looks like a ritual sacrifice in order for the LA Lakers to win their 17th championship, & for LeBron to get his 4th ring. I believe this was also a ritual sacrifice for the 49ers to win the Superbowl. It goes on about the significance of other numbers, like Bryants birthday, before concluding: This definitely makes me believe that his untimely death has been planned for a while now. This post was flagged as part of Facebooks efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) On Jan. 25, Los Angeles Laker LeBron James passed Bryants all-time scoring record. Playing against the Philadelphia 76ers that day, James finished with 29 points, bringing his career total to 33,655, according to the Washington Post. Bryant finished his career with 33,643. Bryant tweeted his congratulations that night: Continuing to move the game forward @KingJames. Much respect my brother #33644. But theres no evidence to suggest that Bryant, a former Lakers star, was killed in a ritual sacrifice, as the Instagram post claims. Rather, Bryants plane crashed in fog dense enough that the Los Angeles Police Department grounded its helicopters. National Transportation Safety Board investigators arrived in California after the incident, and the agency is working with the Federal Aviation Administration, the helicopters manufacturer and the company that made its engine to collect evidence about the crash, according to the Post. The investigation will look at weather data, radar information air traffic control communications, maintenance logs and the pilots record.",0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,false

Final Rating: False  ",SaysGeorgia becomes first state to ban Muslim culture in historic move to restore Western values.,"A post that appears to have originated from fake news purveyors in Macedonia used a real news item from months ago to falsely say the U.S. state of Georgia has outlawed Muslim culture. A March 13, 2017, post on USANewsPost.us carried the headline, Georgia becomes first state to ban Muslim culture in historic move to restore Western values.  Facebook users flagged the post as potentially being fake, as part of the social media giants efforts to remove fake news from news feeds. PolitiFact Georgia examined the origins of this claim as part of the inauguralInternational Fact-Checking Day, April 2, 2017. Organizers at Poynter.orgdescribe the day as not a single event but a rallying cry for more facts - and fact-checking - in politics, journalism, and everyday life. The story cited an actual event — a Peach State lawmaker had introduced a bill in November 2016 in the Georgia General Assembly that would have banned the wearing of burqas, niqabs and veils. The story trumpeted the bill as being about keeping the American people safe. But the post did not indicate that the legislation never became law. State Rep. Jason Spencer on Nov. 15 filed HB 3 for the 2017 legislative session. The bill aimed to expand the scope of a state law passed in 1951 that made wearing a mask a misdemeanor (unless it was for celebrations, work, sports or emergencies). The original law aimed to prevent Ku Klux Klan members from wearing their hoods. Spencers bill could have prevented Muslim women from wearing any kind of head covering while driving, or possibly even while on public property. It also prevented people from wearing veils in drivers licenses and government-issued IDs, a rule the state already had. This bill is simply a response to constituents that do have concerns of the rise of Islamic terrorism, and we in the State of Georgia do not want our laws used against us, Spencer told Atlantas WSB-TV. The quote is cited in the USANewsPost.us article, which made an inference that if the bill passed, Georgia would have stopped Muslim culture in a way no other state had. (For the most part, the wearing of religious headcoverings is protected by the First Amendment.) But the bill didnt pass the General Assembly, because Spencer withdrew the measure just two days later. After further consideration, I have decided to not pursue HB 3 in the upcoming 2017 legislative session due to the visceral reaction it has created, he said in a statement. While this bill does not contain language that specifically targets any group, I am mindful of the perception that it has created. My objective was to address radical elements that could pose a threat to public safety. However, further consideration dictates that other solutions will need to be considered. In conclusion, anti-masking statutes have been upheld as constitutional (State vs Miller, 1990), and HB 3 would withstand legal scrutiny, but not political scrutiny. The Miller case to which Spencer refers involved a Klan member who challenged the Anti-Mask Act and lost. USANewsPost.us cites DailyUSAUpdate.com as the source of the post, and that site in turn says the post came from OpenMagazines.com. The story also has been shared on Facebook, across several other websites, tens of thousands of times. We contacted OpenMagazines.com via email to ask them about the misleading headline but didnt hear back. BuzzFeed has previously reported that both OpenMagazines.com and DailyUSAUpdate.com are registered to owners in Macedonia. The former Yugoslav republic became a hotbed of fake news during last years presidential election. Buzzfeed found that teenagers in the town of Veles operated at least 140 websites that published fake political news in the United States to draw in advertising dollars. USANewsPost.us also is registered to an administrator and address in Veles. Our ruling Bloggers said in a headline, Georgia becomes first state to ban Muslim culture in historic move to restore Western values. The post misrepresents the outcome of a months-old and short-lived legislative proposal from November 2016 that could have prevented Muslim women from hearing veils and headscarves. Muslim culture was not banned, although it did appear to briefly be under attack.",0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,false

Final Rating: False  ","Says Kamala Harris said, If elected & you dont surrender your guns, I will sign an executive order & the police will show up at your door.","Sen. Kamala Harris has taken a strong stance on gun control, but has she actually threatened to send police to your house to take your guns? The short answer is no. But that hasnt stopped social media users from spreading a fabricated quote attributed to her that suggests otherwise. If elected & you dont surrender your guns, I will sign an executive order & the police will show up at your door, reads a post attributed to Harris, the newly selected running mate for presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden. Harris didnt say this. And there is no evidence Harris plans to force people to surrender their guns. The post was flagged as part of Facebooks efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The claim appears to be a mischaracterization of a pledge Harris made during a CNN Presidential Town Hall in April 2019. Upon being elected, I will give the United States Congress 100 days to get their act together and have the courage to pass reasonable gun safety laws, and if they fail to do it, then I will take executive action, Harris said during the town hall. Harris continued, clarifying what her executive action would encompass. And specifically what I will do is put in place a requirement that for anyone who sells more than five guns a year, they are required to do background checks when they sell those guns, Harris said. I will require that for any gun dealer that breaks the law, the ATF take their license. During the town hall, Harris did not discuss confiscating guns using law enforcement officers. Whats more, a commitment to use executive action can refer to more than just executive orders, as the Washington Post reported. At another campaign event in August 2019 in Las Vegas, Harris reiterated her pledge to take action on guns within 100 days of taking office. At that event, she said she would also use executive action to implement a ban on the importation of assault rifles into our country. In a follow-up question, Harris was asked what enforcement of an assault rifles ban might look like. A reporter is heard off-camera asking, Does it involve law enforcement essentially going to peoples houses looking for specific banned guns? Does it involve perhaps creating a database of people who are legal gun owners? What kind of process are we talking about here? Harris answered by referencing her experience as attorney general in California, when she said law enforcement was permitted to confiscate guns by going to the doors of people who were both found by a court to be a danger to themselves and others and were also on a list where they were precluded and prohibited from owning a gun because of a conviction. I have to stress, lawful gun ownership, that is one thing. Were talking about something else and we have to stop conflating and blending all these issues, Harris said. Harris did not say she planned to send law enforcement officers to the homes of all gun owners, as the post suggests. When we first spotted the false quote being shared Aug. 11 on a Facebook page called YET-iheart-NRA, PolitiFact reached out to the page administrator to ask what evidence they had to support the claim. Someone with the Facebook page responded, pointing us to an article from the blog Law Enforcement Today. That article referenced an exchange between Biden and Harris in the September 2019 Democratic presidential primary debate, found here. In it, debate moderator David Muir of ABCs World News Tonight pointed out that Harris said she planned to use executive action to ban imports of AR-15 assault weapons if Congress did not act quickly enough. Muir explained that Biden had expressed doubts about the future presidents constitutional authority to ban assault weapons via executive order, which Harris had not committed to doing. When asked if Bidens stated concern had a point, Harris jokingly replied, I mean I would just say, Hey Joe, instead of saying no we cant, lets say yes we can. Here again, there is no evidence she made the statement that is being attributed to her. (The post made by YET-iheart-NRA appears to have been removed since we inquired about it.) Other fact-checking organizations debunked similar claims that circulated online in 2019, but Harris new role as vice presidential candidate caused the claim to reemerge. Fact-checking organizations have continued debunking the claim after it reappeared. A post claims that vice presidential candidate Sen. Kamala Harris said, If elected & you dont surrender your guns, I will sign an executive order & the police will show up at your door. This quote is fabricated. When she was running for president, Harris pledged to take executive action on gun control within the first 100 days of her administration. She did not say she would require people to surrender their guns or say she would order law enforcement to collect guns.",0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,false

Final Rating: False  ",Ronald Reagans philosophy of peace through strength is why the Iranians released the hostages on the same day and at the same hour that Reagan was sworn in.,"During a March 6, 2012, video address to a conference of the American-Israel Public Affairs Committee, Mitt Romney seized the tough foreign policy mantle of President Ronald Reagan. I believe the right course is what Ronald Reagan called peace through strength, Romney told the pro-Israel group. There's a reason why the Iranians released the hostages on the same day and at the same hour that Reagan was sworn in. As president, I'll offer that kind of clarity, strength and resolve. But was Reagans peace through strength philosophy really responsible for freeing the 52 Americans who were taken hostage by Islamic militants and held for 444 days? First, a reminder of what the hostage crisis was all about. In 1979, the Shah of Iran -- who had been installed and supported by successive United States administrations -- was overthrown by Islamic revolutionaries. Militants took over the American embassy and held hostages from Nov. 4, 1979, until Jan. 20, 1981 -- the day President Jimmy Carter passed the reins to Reagan, who had defeated him amid widespread public disapproval of the incumbents handling of the crisis. Iran contacted the Carter administration in September 1980 with a proposal to end the hostage crisis, said Gary Sick, a Columbia University professor who has written two books about the Iran hostage crisis. The U.S. made a proposal. Iran responded with an unacceptable offer just a day or two before the election. Afterwards, they nominated the Algerians to act as intermediaries. Those valuable discussions went on until literally the day or two before the inauguration, and they were settled by the Iranians caving in on a number of issues that were extremely costly to them. By my calculations, the Iranians ended up paying about $300,000 per hostage per day of incarceration. The agreement that led to the release, as described by the New York Times 11 days after it occured, revolved around $11 billion to $12 billion in Iranian assets that Carter had frozen 10 days after the seizure of the U.S. embassy. It had been negotiated over the course of several months before Reagan's inauguration. The Times, in its account of the inauguration, reported that no one on the speaker's stand knew of the latest developments in Iran. Word quickly spread among the governors, Congressmen and Reagan friends, family and aides as they left the platform. Carter informed Reagan at 8:31 a.m. that the release of the hostages was imminent, but the onetime bitter rivals for the presidency told reporters as they entered the speaker's area separately, to the flourish of trumpets, that the hostages had not yet taken off from Tehran. The President got his first chance to announce the news at 2:15 p.m. at a luncheon with Congressional leaders in Statuary Hall in the Capitol. So Reagan, not Carter, got to bask in the glow of the hostages safe return. However, we contacted seven scholars of the period, and their consensus was that neither Reagan nor his philosophy played any significant role in freeing the hostages. Well before Reagan became president, the deal for releasing the hostages had already been worked out by the Carter administration's State Department and the Iranians, ably assisted by Algerian diplomats, said David Farber, a Temple University historian and author of Taken Hostage: The Iranian Hostage Crisis and America's First Encounter with Radical Islam. No Reagan administration officials participated in the successful negotiations, Farber added. The Iranian government waited to officially release the Americans until Carter had left the presidency as a final insult to Carter, whom they despised. They believed Carter had betrayed the Iranian revolution by allowing the self-exiled Shah to receive medical attention in the United States and then had threatened their new government by attempting, unsuccessfully, to use military force in April 1980 to free the hostages. By doing this, Iran thought they were showing the world that they could meddle in our affairs, just as we had done to them in 1953, added Dave Houghton, a political scientist at the University of Central Florida and author of U.S. Foreign Policy and the Iran Hostage Crisis. Houghton suggested that Iran had a relatively unsophisticated grasp of U.S. politics, and said he thinks its possible that the Iranians didnt even know what Reagan had said on the campaign trail. I don't think they were scared into the release, Houghton said. In all likelihood, they released the hostages because they needed the sanctions we'd placed on them lifted so they could finance their war with Iraq. The one scholar who entertained the possibility that Iran was taking heed of the future presidents philosophy was Michael Gunter, a political scientist at Tennessee Tech University and the author of several papers about the crisis. Still, Gunter added, the main reason for the release was that the mileage the Iranians had gained by holding the hostages had been used for everything it was worth and there was no further advantage in continuing. Several other experts agreed that the Iranians focus was on Carter, not Reagan. If it was related to the occupant of the White House, it certainly had more to do with Carter than Reagan, said Stephen Kinzer, a former New York Times reporter who now teaches at Boston University and authored the book, Reset: Iran, Turkey, and Americas Future. My guess is that the hostages would have been released even if someone else had been inaugurated -- anyone but Carter. The Iranians had come to hate Carter and didn't want to give him a triumph. Giving it to someone else was fine with them. Sick, the Columbia University professor, said that those who wish to believe that the final flurry of activity was out of fear of Reagan have a right to their opinion. Those closer to the events believed that the Iranians, who had clearly decided months earlier that the hostages were a wasting asset, feared that they would have to start the whole laborious process of negotiation over from scratch with a new administration, which obviously had no great appeal. The Romney campaign did not return an inquiry seeking backup for the candidates claim. Our ruling We cant read the Iranians minds, but seven scholars of the period told us that Reagans foreign policy approach was either a minor factor in the release of the hostages or not a factor at all. The fact that the deal was negotiated entirely by the Carter administration, without involvement by Reagan or his transition team, seems to support the expert consensus. Romney made a claim that flies in the face of history and offered no evidence to support it.",0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,false

Standing a few feet behind him and in front of millions of television viewers, Pelosi tore up a copy of Trumps 2020 State of the Union speech seconds after he finished giving the address. But despite an image you might have seen shared on Facebook, the California Democrat did not issue a tweet saying she was disgusted with Trump over taxes. The tweet attributed to her reads: I am disgusted with President Trump allowing people to keep more of the money they earn. It is this type of wide spread theft of public resources that keeps America from being great Mr. President. The image was flagged as part of Facebooks efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The supposed tweet is dated Dec. 20, 2017. Thats the day Congress passed a $1.5 trillion tax cut bill that Trump signed into law a few days later. Pelosi opposed the measure and Democrats criticized it as favoring the rich. While the blue-checked Twitter handle that appears in the image (@NancyPelosi) might seem legitimate, her actual Twitter account handle is @SpeakerPelosi. Whats more, she uses a different photo for her Twitter account than the one we see in this Facebook image. A Pelosi spokesman called the supposed tweet fiction. Hes right. It was outed as fake long ago.

Revolution Signal.,"President Donald Trump has promoted a big protest in Washington, D.C., on Jan. 6, when Congress is scheduled to certify President-elect Joe Bidens victory in the 2020 election. But an image being spread online is not a sign that the president is calling for a revolution. 1776 flag flying over White House! reads the headline on a Jan. 4 blog post on the Hal Turner Radio Show website. REVOLUTION SIGNAL. The post goes on to say that the 1776 flag is presently flying atop the White House in Washington, DC. It is the signal of REVOLUTION from our President! The time is here. The storm is upon us. Rise-up, America. Rise up against the fraudulent election. This post was flagged as part of Facebooks efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The flag in the photo is washed out, but the blog post seems to be referring to the 13-star flag, the first official U.S. flag to fly after the countrys founding in 1776. However, the photo isnt recent. Dan Scavino, the White House deputy chief of staff, posted it on Instagram on June 1, 2019. We didnt find any media coverage about the White House flying the 13-star flag around that time, and it was in the news. Nike pulled Fourth of July sneakers featuring the flag over concerns that it was a symbol for racism. We also found no evidence that such a flag is currently flying over the White House. But in any case, the image that purportedly shows an older flag that Trump raised to rally an uprising is more than a year old.

Final Rating: False","In the class of 1968 at Patrice Lumumba University in Moscow, Mahmoud Abbas was one of the members of that class, and so was Ali Khamenei. And that's where they first established relationships with the young Vladimir Putin.","It sounds like the opening to a joke: A young Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas, Iranian Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei and Russian President Vladimir Putin walk into a Soviet-era Moscow university  But its a claim that was made with a straight face by Republican presidential candidate Ben Carson -- on national television, three times. First, on the Oct. 5, 2015, edition of the Fox News show Hannity, Carson said Putinsrelationships go way, way, way, way back, you know? 1968 at Patrice Lumumba University -- that's when Putin first got to know the Ali Khamenei, and also Mahmoud Abbas. Then, on Oct. 8, Carson said much the same thing to CNN anchor Wolf Blitzer. Putin already has substantial ties in the Middle East, Carson said. In the class of 1968 at Patrice Lumumba University in Moscow, Mahmoud Abbas was one of the members of that class, and so was Ali Khamenei. And that's where they first established relationships with the young Vladimir Putin. And then again to Andrea Mitchell on MSNBC on Oct. 9: Putin has longstanding relationships with people in that area. In the class of 1968 at Patrice Lumumba University in Moscow, Mahmoud Abbas was in that class, and so was Ali Khamenei. And that was when they first became familiar with Putin. Really? Three future world leaders -- and three people many Americans consider adversaries -- found themselves kicking around a university in Moscow in 1968, building ties that would serve them decades later? We had to check it out. When we asked Carsons staff whether they had any supporting evidence, aide Ying Ma wrote back, Thanks for your inquiry. We are not in the habit of providing Googling support to the media. If there is a specific aspect of Dr. Carson's statement that you wish to challenge, please let us know and we can go from there. We did have difficulty finding any support for the claim, and we forwarded what we found to the campaign but did not hear back. Heres a rundown, point by point. Mahmoud Abbas The portion of the claim dealing with Abbas has the most supporting evidence, but even here its not all that clear-cut. Its fairly well documented that Abbas -- the head of theWest Bank-based Palestinian government -- did do some academic work in the Soviet Union. This part of Abbas biography gained some attention in 1995, when Abbas became a key Palestinian figure in the Oslo peace accords. Reports surfaced that Abbas had written a doctoral thesis in the early 1980s titled, The Other Side: The Secret Relationship between Nazism and the Zionist Movement. Critics, including the Simon Wiesenthal Center, criticized the thesis for seeming to minimize the Holocaust, and he later distanced himself from some of its conclusions. The importance of Abbas thesis for our fact-check is that it was presented at a Soviet university, variously described as Oriental College, the Institute of Oriental Studies or Moscow State University. Oddly, Wikipedia is the only source that citesPatrice Lumumba University, an institution of higher education in Moscow that was designed to serve an international student clientele and which has been linked by some observers to the KGB. (Its now known as Peoples' Friendship University.) We did track down one possibly credible source placing Abbas at Lumumba -- a 2010 article from Ria Novosti, a state-owned news agency. Contrary to popular myths, (Patrice Lumumba University) released from its walls not too many successful politicians -- about a dozen future ministers and only two future leaders of their countries, the article said. In addition to a president of Guyana, the article cited Abbas, who graduated from the law faculty, the article said. Still, a degree from Patrice Lumumba doesnt appear in most biographies of Abbas. He is more often listed as having earned his law degree (or in some tellings, a bachelors degree) from the University of Damascus. In addition, most bios place Abbas working for Palestinian organizations in 1967 and 1968. He would have been 33 in 1968, the year Carson cited. So what do we know about Abbas? We know for sure that he took short visits to Moscow to defend his doctoral thesis around 1982 (where, apparently, he always drank coffee with cardamom, according to a 2005 Russian media account by a former professor). Its also conceivable that Abbas had some connection with Patrice Lumumba University, though the evidence of that is equivocal. But theres no hard evidence that Abbas was at Lumumba in 1968, which is what Carson said. Ali Khamenei There is no mention in the official biography of Irans supreme leader that he ever studied in the Soviet Union, and the timeline thats known would have made it difficult for him to have done so. We did not hear back from the Iranian mission to the United Nations, but Ali Alfoneh, a researcher at the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies, looked into the question in 2012 when he was at the American Enterprise Institute. He wrote, According to Khameneis official biography, he travelled to Iraq in 1957 to study at the Theological Seminary in Najaf. Since the Peoples Friendship University was first established (as Lumumba) in 1960, the young Khamenei could not have used his journey to Iraq as a cover for his studies in the Soviet Union. On the other hand, Alfoneh continued, Khameneis biography says he spent a clandestine life in Tehran between March 1966 and March 1967, after which he was arrested by the police and imprisoned. The existence of this clandestine period may have fed the rumor that he spent time studying in Moscow. Certainly a period studying in the godless Soviet Union would be something Khamenei -- the head of a theocracy -- would want to keep under wraps. In an interview, Alfoneh said he isnt convinced of the Khamenei-in-the-Soviet-Union claim. I'm very skeptical, he said. So where did this rumor come from? The allegations garnered attention in 2010 when RT, a network tightly controlled by Putins Kremlin, aired a piece about the 50th anniversary of Peoples' Friendship University and mentioned in passing that Khamenei was an alumnus. (We tried to contact the university, but didnt get a response. Neither Abbas nor Khamenei is listed among the schools eminent graduates.) The earlier citations of this claim arent well sourced, either. It appears to have surfaced initially in a 1989 column by Smith Hempstone, a journalist and future U.S. ambassador to Kenya, that ran in a small, western Pennsylvania newspaper. We also found a brief article in a Russian newspaper from 2003 that mentions the claim in passing. None of these approximate a primary source. A half-dozen experts on the region unanimously told us that they doubted Khamenei ever studied in the Soviet Union -- or that he did so in 1968, when he would have been 29. I've never seen it corroborated, said Karim Sadjadpour, a senior associate at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. John Limbert, a professor of international affairs at the U.S. Naval Academy, called the idea bizarre. And David Houghton, a senior lecturer in the defense studies department at Kings College of London, called it unlikely in the absolute extreme. The Soviet Union is the absolute last place where one could expect to find Khamenei at any stage in his career, and I personally do not believe that he ever studied there or had any links to Putin, Houghton said. It looks like a rather daft conspiracy theory to me. Vladimir Putin The biggest problem for the Putin portion of Carsons claim is the calendar: In 1968, Putin would have been 16 years old. According to his official biography, in 1960-1968, Vladimir Putin attended Primary School No. 193 in Leningrad. After the eighth grade, he entered High School No. 281, a chemistry-focused magnet school under the aegis of a technology institute, completing his studies there in 1970. Its pretty difficult to imagine that he could have met Messrs. Abbas and Khamenei under any circumstances at age 16 in Moscow, unless he ran into them randomly on the street on some kind of school or family trip — if, indeed, they were actually there, said Fiona Hill, director of the Center on the United States and Europe at the Brookings Institution. In addition, Putin grew up in Leningrad (now St. Petersburg). That is a 9-to-10-hour car ride from Moscow and Patrice Lumumba University. He studied between 1970 and 1975 in the law faculty of Leningrad State University, saidRichard Sakwa, a professor of Russian and European politics at the University of Kent. The claim by Ben Carson is garbled rubbish. A defense The closest we came to any of this making sense was an interview with Cliff Kincaid, who runs a group called Americas Survival, Inc. Kincaid published a paper titled, Communists and Muslims: The Hidden Hand of the KGB that raises many of these claims. Kincaid made the case that Carson was saying Abbas and Khamenei could have been agents of the KGB, and if they were, Putin, who rose to colonel in the KGB, would have known them. Carson was clearly saying that Putin, as a former KGB colonel and later head of the FSB, the new name for the KGB, would have knowledge of Abbas and Khamenei attending Patrice Lumumba University, a KGB-controlled institution, Kincaid told PolitiFact. That made them subject to KGB influence, if not KGB agents. Whether Putin personally met them in his younger years is beside the point.  Please report these facts rather than nitpick Carson on the ages of the various players. We hereby report those facts. Still, this isnt what Carson said. Our ruling Carson said, In the class of 1968 at Patrice Lumumba University in Moscow, Mahmoud Abbas was one of the members of that class, and so was Ali Khamenei. And that's where they first established relationships with the young Vladimir Putin. This is one of the more bizarre claims weve heard so far in the 2016 presidential campaign, and thats saying something. Abbas may have attended the university, though we dont know for sure, or when. No credible evidence has yet surfaced to place Khamenei as a student in the Soviet Union -- ever, much less in close proximity to Abbas, or in 1968. And Putin would have been a teenager in 1968, attending school 450 miles away. The idea that the three men developed lifelong ties as students in the late-1960s-era Soviet Union is ridiculous.

The article quoted Palin as saying people should run the Mall of America into the ground, on the basis of Santa always having been white in the Bible, and, No, I refuse to believe that they went this far in trying to cater to the minorities, I thought the company had some backbone but I guess I was wrong, The former Alaska governor and 2008 Republican vice presidential candidate never said these things.

Every article has a show facts button to illuminate which parts of the story are real and those that are fabricated. When you click the show facts button on the Palin article, it highlights as fact the first paragraph, which is about the Mall of Americas real decision to hire a black Santa. But the entire rest of the article, detailing Palins supposed call to boycott the mall because of the Bibles teachings on Santa, is completely made up. Dear Democrats, this is what fake news actually looks like, and I guarantee you no Trump voter actually fell for this, Palin wrote on Facebook Dec. 20, with a link to a Breitbart article debunking the Politicono.com post.

Final Rating: False","Says Paul Ryan said that 22 million Americans choose to be poor, so its their own problem if they cant afford to be healthy.","A story that claimed House Speaker Paul Ryan said millions of people have willingly elected to be impoverished is fake news. A June 28, 2017, post on Politicot.com ran under the headline, Paul Ryan: 22 million Americans choose to be poor, so its their own problem if they cant afford to be healthy. Facebook users flagged the post as part of the social media sites efforts to fight fake news. The post started out with real comments Speaker Ryan, R-Wis., made on Fox & Friends on June 27 while discussing the Congressional Budget Office report for the Senates health care bill. What they're basically saying at the Congressional Budget Office is, if you're not going to force people to buy Obamacare, if youre not going to force people to buy something they dont want, then they won't buy it, Ryan said. So it's not that people are getting pushed off a plan. It's that people will choose not to buy something they don't like or want.) Then the Politicot.com story said Ryan launched into a tirade to Foxs Brian Kilmeade about how people should be able to provide for themselves and their families through hard work. Thats where the story turned to fiction. Being rich or poor is a matter of choice; thats all there is to it, Ryan is quoted. So, let me ask you this, Brian: if 22 million people consciously make the choice to not work hard day in and day out, why on earth should the rest of us be concerned with whether or not theyre going to be healthy? If they choose to be poor, then its their own problem if they cant afford to be healthy. Ryan didnt say that last part, because this story was posted on a parody site that makes up all manner of bogus news stories. We reached out to Ryans office but a spokeswoman did not give any comment on the fake quotes. Politicot.com is part of a network of sites related to Newslo.com, which refers to itself in a disclaimer as the first hybrid News/Satire platform on the web. The Politicot.com site is registered to an administrator named Eli Sompo, who runs sites based in Israel and Greece. Sompo has told us he did not write the stories on the websites for which he is responsible, but has several clients. He informed us months ago that he would block any future questions from PolitiFact about the sites. What makes Newslo.com-related stories especially confusing is that they use a small piece of real news or quotes by real people and build fake stories around them. In most cases it is the first paragraph of the story, as happened here. The websites feature a pair of buttons that allow readers to highlight the true parts of their stories, so readers can conceivably know the difference. But it isnt always obvious thats the aim, leading the audience to believe the entire story is true — especially when other fake news sites steal the articles and post them without any warning at all. Ryan did discuss how the Senates proposed legislation would affect poor people, but he never said 22 million people choose to be poor",0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,false

Final Rating: False",Says Jeb Bush has released 10 percent of his emails.,"Hillary Clinton might be in a bit of hot water for using a private email account for official business as secretary of state, but Democrats eagerly point to similar email issues with presumptiveRepublican presidential candidate Jeb Bush. As governor of Florida, Bush burnished his tech and public access credentials by using a personal email account to supplement the one the state provided. Prior to Clintons troubles, Bush set up a special website for the public to browse any of those emails that dealt with official business. Like Clinton, Bush himself determined which ones were private and which would be made public, but the move was largely seen as a way to mark Bush as a candidate who walks the walk when it comes to transparency. This led Democratic activist James Carville to challenge how transparent Bush really is. Jeb Bush has released 10 percent of his emails, Carville said on ABCs This Week, March 15, 2015. He had a private email server. He destroyed his emails. We decided to check Carvilles numbers. Carvilles assistant, Kees Nordin, gave PunditFact the underlying math. The fact is that of Jeb Bush's 3 million emails (public and private) he's only released 275,000 or just under 10 percent, Nordin said. According to Bushspokeswoman Kristy Campbell, Bush posted nearly 280,000 emails from his personal email account on a website he set up, jebbushemails.com. Back in 2007, Bush gave an off-the-cuff estimate that during his eight years in office he received about 550,000 emails at his personal address [emailprotected]. We tried to confirm that number, but Campbell said Its immaterial as they are not subject to public records request and not required by law to be retained. In the same interview in 2007, Bush said an additional 2.5 million emails came through other email accounts run by the state. So this is how Carville gets to a grand total of 3 million emails. The question is, did Bush reveal just 275,000 -- or 280,000 -- of them? The answer is no, because most of them have been, and remain, publicly available. Under Florida law, most of Bush's emails to his government accounts are a public record and accessible to people who request them, said Barbara Petersen, president of Floridas First Amendment Foundation. (The First Amendment Foundation advocates for government transparency and receives major support from foundations and Floridas news organizations, including the Tampa Bay Times.) Anything relating to public business is a public record in Florida, Petersen said. If you comment on a policy, even if the rest of the email is personal, it will be subject to a public records request. Its a fairly broad definition. Importantly, all of the emails sent to accounts run by the state would have been seen and vetted by state workers, not private staffers or lawyers employed by Bush. They remain the custodian of those records, andPetersen said shebelieves most of the Bush emails from his official accounts have been retained. The first stop for those emails would be the Citizen Services office, which fields all incoming communications to the governor. While some emails might be purely personal or otherwise exempt and would not be released, they were still part of the states public record. The point being, only the 550,000 emails sent to Bushs personal account would have remained under his exclusive control. The rest remain housed with the state government. What's the point? We can confidently say that the 280,000 emails on the Bush website represent just a fraction of the total number of emails that are public. While the precise figures are unclear, if 2.5 million emails went to one of the state-run email accounts then all of those were subject to a public records request. So in a rough sense, close to 90 percent of the universe of 3 million emailsare public in some form. If you look at just Bush's private emails, about 50 percent are public. Neither number is close to the one Carville cited. We reached out to state officials to see if they can add any information about the number of officialemails thatare part of Bush's record. Wewill update this item if we learn further details. A few notes Carville said Bush had a private email server. According to press reports, Bush used a server located in the governor's office. He took the server with him when he left office. Carville also said Bush destroyedthe emails he hadnt revealed. We asked how he knew that and got no reply.Petersen had the same question and noted that Florida law presents a hurdle to destroying emails. If you made a public record request of Jebs email and you thought you didn't get them all, you can file suit in civil court and request an in camera inspection by a judge, she said. Petersen said the state judges which records have archival value and which ones are trivial and can be disposed. Our ruling Carville said that Bush revealed 10 percent of his emails and he destroyed his emails. The numbers dont add up. The numbers used by Carville himself include 2.5 million emails sent to state run accounts. Those emails are subject to a public records request. It is completely inaccurate to say that Bush only revealed 275,000 or 280,000 emails out of a total of 3 million. A more accurate reading would be that he revealed about half of the emails sent to his private account, and the rest were already available to the press, although some might be held back if they were strictly personal in nature.",0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,false

A new rumor on Facebook suggests that environmental factors connected to climate change, like severe heat and drought, have nothing to do with the fires. Instead the post pins much of the destruction on one man. The Sept. 20 post features the mans mugshot and implores users to meet mr. climate change and says hes responsible for lighting 32 of the wildfires. The man in the image, Brandon McGlover, did light fires in California, and he was arrested and sentenced for it — but it happened in 2018, and there werent 32 fires. The post was flagged as part of Facebooks efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) In July 2018, deputies from the Riverside County Sheriff's Department in California arrested Brandon N. McGlover on charges of five counts of arson to wildland. (The amount of fires linked to McGlover was later upped to nine.) One of the fires McGlover was accused of setting became the Cranston Fire, which destroyed multiple buildings, forced thousands of evacuations, and burned over 13,000 acres before it was fully contained. Contemporaneous news reports said that a heat wave in California exacerbated the fires spread. McGlover pleaded guilty to arson charges for the Cranston Fire in 2019 and was sentenced to 12 years in prison. Fire officials and experts believe that the West Coasts 2020 wildfire season has been mostly fueled by a combination of severe drought, historic heat, lightning storms and heavy winds. RELATED: Climate change created conditions for the West Coast fires, experts say There are a couple of exceptions. A man was arrested on charges of arson and cultivating marijuana in connection with Californias Dolan Fire, and officials said San Bernardino Countys El Dorado Fire was caused by a device at a gender reveal party. A post suggests climate change has nothing to do with the fires burning in the Western U.S., blaming instead one man for setting 32 wildfires. That isnt true. Brandon McGlover was arrested in 2018 for lighting nine fires in southwest California and is currently serving a 12-year prison sentence. Also, experts say that climate change has modified environments in the West Coast, making them more conducive to wildfires.",0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,false

It was. Posted April 5, the tweet claimed that Pat Robertson believed he found the source of COVID-19 during an episode of The 700 Club. Robertson founded The 700 Club in 1966. He has hosted it since. The tweet is a screenshot of a quote. It says, Some of these young uns are doing all kinds of unnatural things with their sex organs. When people do that, they transfer all kinds of chemicals from ladies private parts and thats where I think the virus came from. We never had this kind of thing when I was coming up. But no one was committing oral sex back then. The tweet led to a Twitter trend for Pat Robertson and caused a spike in Google searches for Robertson. The quote has since been shared on Facebook and Reddit by angry users. Except Robertson didnt say it at all. The tweet was taken from a satire piece on The Business Standard News website. The Business Standard News is a satirical site designed to parody the 24-hour news cycle. The stories are outlandish, but reality is so strange nowadays they could be true, the sites about page said. We reached out to Christain Broadcasting Network just to be sure. CBN, founded by Robertson, confirmed he said no such thing. Robertson ran for president in 1988. He founded the Christian Coalition and the American Center for Law and Justice, which was labeled as the Christian response to the ACLU. He founded Regent University. He has owned several other businesses. Some people who responded to the tweet compared it to past controversial claims. In the 90s, he described feminists as people who practice witchcraft, destroy capitalism, and become lesbians. More recently, he told 700 Club viewers that he wishes there was a Facebook vomit button for every time he saw a gay couple kissing. Robertson has talked COVID-19 before, but he has not mentioned oral sex as being the cause. As for causes, Robertson did say that if your gut is healthy, you dont have to worry about corona.' In 2012, Robertson did weigh in on oral sex — he said it was okay, as long as it was between a husband and wife. A viral tweet attributed a quote to Robertson saying he believed oral sex and lady parts caused COVID-19. This originated from a satire website.",0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,false

Final Rating: False  ",Says Ivanka Trump was targeted in the Florida condominium building collapse.,"A conspiracy theory widely shared on Facebook claims that the partial collapse of an oceanside condominium building near Miami was actually an attack aimed at a high-value target — Ivanka Trump, daughter of former President Donald Trump. The claim, posted on the same day as the June 24 collapse, stated: Whatre the chances that the building collapse is 5 buildings south of Ivanka?  50 ppl still missing.. yup more and more convinced they were targeting hvt, if not also destroying evidence and/or closing tunnel entrances. USING THE TUNNELS UNDER THE HOTEL FOR SEARCH AND RESCUE. The building was in OK shape. The upscale condo near Miami Beach still collapsed Champlain Towers South Condo in Surfside near Miami Beach was completed in 1981. A recent condo sold for $710,000 at the oceanside. The post, which included photos of the collapse and a map indicating the proximity of Ivanka Trumps residence to that building, was flagged as part of Facebooks efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The day after the collapse, with search-and-rescue efforts still under way, officials said they did not know the cause of the collapse and that it would be some time before an investigation can try to find the cause. The Champlain Towers South, a 12-story condo building constructed in 1981 in Surfside, a town northeast of Miami, partially collapsed early on the morning of June 24. At a media briefing the next afternoon, Miami-Dade County Mayor Daniella Levine Cava said four people had died and 159 remained unaccounted for, but that the numbers were fluid. She said that although search-and-rescue efforts continue, structural engineers eventually would investigate what might have caused the collapse. Republican Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis also made it clear that it would take some time before an investigation of a possible cause can be fully undertaken. He said: We need a definitive explanation for how this could have happened, and thats an explanation that needs to be an accurate explanation, its an explanation that we dont want to get wrong, obviously, but at the same time I do think its important that its timely. Engineering and architectural experts told the New York Times it could take a long time to determine the cause of the collapse, but that possibilities include corroded components, an undermined foundation, or defects in the construction or design. Shimon Wdowinski, a professor in the Department of Earth and Environment at Florida International University in Miami, said the building showed signs of land subsidence — a gradual settling or sudden sinking of the Earths surface — in the 1990s, according to space-based radar data he analyzed. But land subsidence alone likely would not cause a buildings collapse, he said. Several engineering experts suggested a number of factors could have played a role, including saltwater corroding the concrete and potentially weakening beams that hold up the structure, the Miami Herald reported. Scientists have long noted the risk of building on the shifting sands of a barrier island such as Miami Beach, especially with rising sea levels, NBC News reported. That may not be the reason for this collapse, but it remains an engineering challenge in the region, the network said. According to news reports, the Miami home of Ivanka Trump and her husband, Jared Kushner, both of whom served as White House aides under Donald Trump, is a block away from the building that collapsed. The Wall Street Journal reported in January that the couple leased a condo at a building called Arte.",0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,false

Final Rating: False  ","The COVID-19 vaccines make people magnetized. They can put a key on their forehead, it sticks. They can put spoons and forks all over them, and they can stick.","An anti-vaccine activist falsely claimed during a hearing with Ohio state legislators that the COVID-19 vaccines are magnetizing people who get them. Dr. Sherri Tenpenny, an Ohio-based osteopathic physician who wrote a book called Saying No to Vaccines, has been identified by the news site rating service Newsguard as a super-spreader of COVID-19 vaccine misinformation. A watchdog group found that she is one of 12 influencers responsible for 65% of anti-vaccine misinformation spread on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter. Tenpenny has previously pushed false claims that the COVID-19 vaccines can cause death and autoimmune disease, disrupt pregnancies and shed to affect unvaccinated people. Her latest comments came as she testified at the invitation of Ohios Republican lawmakers in favor of a bill that would prevent businesses or the government from requiring proof of COVID-19 vaccination, according to the Columbus Dispatch. Im sure youve seen the pictures all over the internet of people whove had these shots, and now theyre magnetized, Tenpenny said during the June 8 hearing. They can put a key on their forehead, it sticks. They can put spoons and forks all over them, and they can stick. Because now we think that theres a metal piece to that. Those claims are baseless. There are no metallic ingredients in any of the COVID-19 vaccines approved in the U.S. for emergency use, from Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna and Johnson & Johnson. The Food and Drug Administration has published the ingredients for each online. Theres nothing there that a magnet can interact with, Thomas Hope, a vaccine researcher at Northwestern University, previously told AFP Fact Check. Its protein and lipids, salts, water and chemicals that maintain the pH. Thats basically it, so this is not possible. PolitiFact and several other fact-checkers previously debunked the videos and pictures all over the internet that Tenpenny cited as proof, which purported to show magnets sticking to vaccinated people. The social media posts about vaccine magnetism were so widespread that the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention addressed them on its website: Can receiving a COVID-19 vaccine cause you to be magnetic? No. Receiving a COVID-19 vaccine will not make you magnetic, including at the site of vaccination which is usually your arm. COVID-19 vaccines do not contain ingredients that can produce an electromagnetic field at the site of your injection. All COVID-19 vaccines are free from metals such as iron, nickel, cobalt, lithium, and rare earth alloys, as well as any manufactured products such as microelectronics, electrodes, carbon nanotubes, and nanowire semiconductors. In addition, the typical dose for a COVID-19 vaccine is less than a milliliter, which is not enough to allow magnets to be attracted to your vaccination site even if the vaccine was filled with a magnetic metal. Florian Krammer, a professor of vaccinology at New York'sIcahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, previously told PolitiFact the claims about vaccine magnetism were utter nonsense. Other experts told AFP Fact Check that the metal objects highlighted in various online videos and images are likely sticking for other reasons. They could have tape or another adhesive on them, for example. Or they could appear to stick because of the oil on a persons skin. Later on in the Ohio House hearing, a nurse tried unsuccessfully to prove Tenpennys theory by positioning a key and a bobby pin against her neck. Explain to me why the key sticks to me. It sticks to my neck too, she said, even as the key she pressed to her neck did notstick.  Wow. An anti-vaccine nurse in Ohio tried to prove the Vaccines Cause Magnetism theory in an state legislative committee. The demonstration did not go to plan pic.twitter.com/0ubELst4E8 Tenpenny also claimed that there is some sort of an interface, yet to be defined interface, between whats being injected in these shots and all of the 5G towers, and that the vaccines have caused thousands of deaths in the U.S. Both of those claims are inaccurate. Tenpenny did not immediately respond to a request for comment from PolitiFact. She told the Washington Post that she stood by her testimony.

Final Rating: False  ","The House voted to cap insulin prices to $35/month, just $420 each year! Richard Hudson voted NO.","With inflation high and many Americans concerned about COVID-19, a Democratic congressional candidate in North Carolina says a Republican incumbent isnt doing enough to ease the burden of medical costs. State Sen. Ben Clark, D-Hoke, is running in the states newly-drawn 9th Congressional District, where hell face Republican U.S. Rep. Richard Hudson if both win their primaries. The district, which leans Republican, is located in south-central North Carolina near Fayetteville. On April 1, Clarks campaign emailed supporters slamming Hudson for how he voted the day before. The email said: Yesterday, the House voted to cap insulin prices to $35/month, just $420 each year! Richard Hudson voted NO. Clarks campaign also tweeted about Hudson, posting that he voted no to lowering the cost of insulin for every family in the 9th Congressional District. What legislation was Clark talking about? And did Hudson really vote against lowering insulin costs? A review of the record shows Clark got this wrong. The U.S. House of Representatives on March 31 voted on H.R.6833, known as the Affordable Insulin Now Act, which would cap insulin co-payments for insured Americans at $35 a month.It would help some Americans save hundreds of dollars annually and offer all insured patients more predictable insulin costs, but wouldnt help the uninsured, the Associated Press reported. The Democrat-led bill passed 232-193 with the help of 12 Republicans — and congressional records show Hudson was one of them. Several media outlets — including Business Insider, the Daily Mail and Yahoo! News — named Hudson among the bills Republican supporters. PolitiFact NC reached out to Clarks campaign shortly after it published the email and tweet about Hudsons vote. The campaign, which deleted its tweet about Hudson, defended its accusations. As far as we know, the Clark campaign hasnt issued a correction to its email. We are aware that last night Richard Hudson changed his vote on capping the cost of insulin to $35/month after voting against this and other bills to reduce the cost of prescription drugs numerous times, the campaign said. After being consistently rated as one of the most conservative Republicans in the House, no one is fooled by his recent shift to the center. We asked the campaign what it meant when it said Hudson changed his vote, but didnt receive a response. Hudsons office said the congressmans March 31 vote is in line with other efforts to reduce insulin prices. Jordan Shaw, one of Hudsons advisors, said Hudson co-sponsored the Lower Costs, More Cures Act of 2019, or H.R. 19, which would have capped the cost of insulin for some Medicare customers. Congressman Hudson was proud to vote to cap out-of-pocket costs for seniors on insulin, and has long advocated for caps on prescription drug costs like those in HR 19. He didnt change his vote, Shaw said. Clark said: Yesterday, the House voted to cap insulin prices to $35/month, just $420 each year! Richard Hudson voted NO.

Final Rating: False  ",The Democrat(ic) position on abortion is now so extreme that they dont mind executing babies AFTER birth.,"On Feb. 25, the Senate took up a bill backed by anti-abortion advocates called the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act. Under the bill, any infant born alive after an abortion or within a hospital, clinic, or other facility has the same claim to the protection of the law that would arise for any newborn, or for any person who comes to a hospital, clinic, or other facility for screening and treatment or otherwise becomes a patient within its care. The bill goes on to say that anyone (except the mother) who intentionally performs or attempts to perform an overt act that kills a child born alive can be prosecuted for intentionally killing or attempting to kill a human being. The bill failed on a procedural motion, with 53 votes in favor when 60 were needed to advance it. The only senators who crossed party lines were Democrats who voted in favor of the measure: Bob Casey of Pennsylvania, Doug Jones of Alabama, and Joe Manchin of West Virginia. Later that day, President Donald Trump registered his disappointment in a pair of linked tweets: Senate Democrats just voted against legislation to prevent the killing of newborn infant children. The Democrat position on abortion is now so extreme that they dont mind executing babies AFTER birth. This will be remembered as one of the most shocking votes in the history of Congress. If there is one thing we should all agree on, its protecting the lives of innocent babies. Senate Democrats just voted against legislation to prevent the killing of newborn infant children. The Democrat position on abortion is now so extreme that they dont mind executing babies AFTER birth.... Those are strong words. We wondered: Is it true that the Democrats vote against the bill mean that theydont mind executing babies AFTER birth? After interviewing a range of experts on both sides of the abortion-policy divide, we concluded that while Democrats have left themselves open to this line of attack, Trumps claim is inaccurate. (The White House did not respond to an inquiry.) Broadly, critics of the bill said that it would take decisions out of the hands of parents and medical professionals and hand it to politicians. Democrats also argued that the number of relevant cases is vanishingly small, and usually involve heartbreaking situations that often have specific, unusual factors at play that are hard to accommodate in advance. Because of this, they saw the bill as a chance for Republicans to embarrass Democrats rather than as a genuine piece of legislation aiming to solve a significant problem. Perhaps the Democrats most basic argument in the context of Trumps charge, however, is that laws already exist to cover the scenario the bill would seek to prevent, making the new bill redundant. In a floor speech before the vote, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said, It has always been illegal to harm a newborn infant. This vote has nothing—nothing—to do with that. Read the language. Sen. Patty Murray of Washington, the ranking Democrat on the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, echoed that argument. This bill is not about protecting infants, as Republicans have claimed, because that is not up for debate and it is already the law, she said. Most legal experts we contacted agreed with this much of the Democrats argument: Killing a baby after birth is already against the law. Actively killing an infant born alive is a crime, said Lois Shepherd, a professor of law and biomedical ethics at the University of Virginia and author of the books Rationing Health Care at the End of Life and If That Ever Happens to Me: Making Life and Death Decisions After Terri Schiavo. Under the law, living infants are just like other living people. They are children. Children are people. Legal experts pointed to several specific laws relevant to newborns: • The Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act, first passed in 1974 and subsequently revised, including major updates in the 1980s. The relevant portion of the law makes certain types of federal funding for states conditional on their adoption of policies to prevent improper withholding of treatment from newborns, including those with disabilities. • The Born-Alive Infants Protection Act of 2002 established that federal legal protections that applied to persons also covered children born at any stage of development, including after an abortion. The law did not directly create civil or criminal penalties, however -- something the 2019 bill would have added. Filling that omission was a key motivator for supporters of the bill. The 2002 law is toothless and purely symbolic, said Dwight Duncan, a University of Massachusetts law professor who serves on the the boards of the Pro-Life Legal Defense Fund and Massachusetts Citizens for Life. • State laws. State, rather than federal, laws are the primary source of protection against active or negligent killing of infants born during the process of abortion, said Teresa S. Collett, a law professor at the University of St. Thomas and director of the universitys Prolife Center. In 2002, Collett said, Congress identified 30 states that had some statutory protection for infants surviving an attempted abortion. Most states would allow prosecution of doctors for killing or failing to resuscitate after a live birth, said Douglas O. Linder, an emeritus law professor at the University of Missouri-Kansas City. In fact, the highest-profile case of this type was prosecuted under state laws: The 2013 trial of Philadelphia abortion doctor Kermit Gosnell, who was sentenced to three life terms for killing a series of late-term newborns in gruesome fashion. Not to provide standard newborn care for those infants that happen to survive an abortion and emerge breathing could be considered a form of negligent killing or homicide, Duncan said. Part of the reason that tensions over abortion have been heightened this year is the consideration of bills in two states -- New York and Virginia -- to ease some of the state-level rules governing abortions, particularly late-term abortions. (We previously fact-checked a statement by Trump about the Virginia bill and another about the New York bill.) Critics of the Democratic position on the Senate bill say the redundancy argument is a fig leaf for political considerations. If Democrats agree with the overall principle, the argument goes, there is little harm in passing a law that reinforces existing statutes. Personally, I do not think it credible for Democrats to say they are against executing babies after birth if they are unwilling to provide criminal and civil penalties to abortion doctors that kill babies that survive abortions, nor provide equal standard of medical care for such babies, Duncan said. It is a largely rhetorical strategy to get out of an embarrassing position. There is a long tradition in Congress by both parties of putting forward bills that seek to force the other party into casting awkward votes. This law would fall into that category, said Mary Ziegler, a Florida State University law professor and author of the books Beyond Abortion: Roe v. Wade and the Fight for Privacy and After Roe: The Lost History of the Abortion Debate. The Senate bill mostly appealed to Republicans because it would put Democrats in a difficult political situation, Ziegler said. Polls show that most Americans are uncomfortable with later abortions, much less anything after a live birth. Focusing on this issue is strategically savvy, even if it would make very little difference to the overall number of abortions. On the other hand, experts agreed that Trumps use of the word executing grossly exaggerated the Democratic position. My impression is that the term execution is generally reserved for public application of the death penalty, Duncan said. Merriam-Websters definition of execution agrees. It says the word refers to a putting to death, especially as a legal penalty. Certainly the deaths envisioned by the recent bill arent carried out as a legal penalty. In reality, both sides agree that active killing of a breathing newborn is -- and should be -- illegal. There is a broad consensus that a child that takes its first breath has crossed a bright line from fetus to child and should be protected by the law, Collett said. This is a clear-cut concept that we can all agree upon, said Gretchen Ely, an associate professor at the University of Buffalos School of Social Work and a board member for Social Workers for Reproductive Justice. The notion that anyone supports executing infants after birth is preposterous. More complicated are cases in which the newborn is so severely disabled that they may not survive beyond a few days. Many abortions that occur later in pregnancy involve fetal anomalies incompatible with life, such as anencephaly, the absence of the brain and cranium above the base of the skull, or limb-body wall complex, when the organs develop outside of the body cavity, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists has written. A failure to resuscitate, which is typical in such cases, is a much more contentious issue, said Arthur Caplan, a bioethicist at New York University Langone Medical Center. Babies born post-abortion, spontaneous or induced, with horrible and potentially painful conditions incompatible with life, would not be routinely resuscitated or aggressively treated by most medical teams. In fact some would not even know how to try, or lack the technology to do so, especially in rural areas. Caplan said he is unaware of examples of medically active killing, and that while allowing to die does happen, it occurs very rarely—say, a baby born with no lungs at 20 weeks. In such a scenario, Trumps image of an execution is hyperbole, experts said. I do not have a clue what is meant by executing after birth, said Leslie Francis, director of the Center for Law and Biomedical Sciences at the University of Utah who also serves as a member of the ethics committee of the American Society for Reproductive Medicine and previously served as a director of the Disability Law Center. Trump said, The Democrat(ic) position on abortion is now so extreme that they dont mind executing babies AFTER birth. Theres little question that the vote on the Senate bill was uncomfortable for Democrats: They effectively voted against a bill whose principles they said they support, arguing that the bill would be redundant because those principles are already enshrined in law. However, Trump overreached when he described Democrats as tolerating executing newborns. No one supports actively killing newborns, much less executing them; the contested terrain concerns what efforts should be made to extend the lives of babies who are not expected to survive long with severe disabilities.",0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,false

Final Rating: False  ","An Environmental Protection Agency regulation that goes into effect Jan. 1, 2012, regulates dust.","It was the kind of question that any politician who opposes big government would love to field during a GOP presidential debate.My question is, if you were forced to eliminate one department from the federal government, which one would you eliminate and why? asked a man from Arlington, Va., via YouTube during the Sept. 22 debate in Orlando.A moderator chose metro Atlantan Herman Cain to answer it, and to the delight of the audience, he turned his hypothetical ax on a favorite target of big government foes: the Environmental Protection Agency.Now, I know that makes some people nervous, but the EPA has gone wild. The fact that they have a regulation that goes into effect Jan. 1, 2012, to regulate dust says that they've gone too far, Cain replied.Dust? The EPA will start regulating dust in January?We contacted the Cain camp for evidence, but they didnt reply. Fortunately, the EPA posted its reports on the issue online. Factcheck.org, a fact-checking operation similar to PolitiFact, looked into Cains comment as well.We found that the EPA has long regulated a category of air pollution called particulate matter, which includes dust. Theres no new regulation scheduled for Jan. 1, 2012.Particle pollution is a floating mix of solid particles and liquid droplets. Sometimes, the particles are visible, like smoke from a power plant, haze, or the dust that Cain mentioned. Other times, theyre so small theyre invisible to the naked eye. These particulates can be made up of any number of chemicals, and can come from a variety of sources such as smokestacks, fires or construction sites.A growing body of scientific evidence links particle pollution to a variety of health problems, including respiratory issues, lung disease, heart problems and even higher death rates, according to multiple independent reviews of the scientific literature as well as the EPA.A small number of studies have even linked naturally occurring dust storms to a rise in trips to the emergency room for cardiovascular problems, according to an EPA review of scientific studies. The EPA has regulated this form of air pollution since 1971 under the Clean Air Act, and requires air monitors in areas with populations greater than 100,000, according to state and federal documents. But it does not specifically single out farm dust for regulation.Since states have to comply with the regulations or risk losing federal money, they may institute rules for farm dust to get into compliance with the law, a lobbyist for the farm industry and news accounts confirm. The Clean Air Act requires the EPA reviews its particle pollution standards every five years. And thats where the current dust-up over dust began.The EPA released its most recent policy assessment in April. It concludes that based on the newest research, its worthwhile to consider tightening some standards on larger or coarse particulates. This category includes dust from landfills, construction sites, agriculture and industrial sources such as steel mills.The agriculture industry and other groups objected, saying this suggestion doesnt make sense for rural areas, where tractors and pickups kick up naturally occurring dirt in the fields or on unpaved roads.But both the EPA and regulation opponents agree that no regulation is in the pipeline, and its certainly not coming Jan. 1.Factcheck.orgs Sept. 23 story on the debate noted that EPA Administrator Lisa Jackson testified before the U.S. House Committee on Agriculture in March that it was a mischaracterization that the EPA is trying to expand regulation of dust from farms.Indeed, the EPA has not formally submitted new regulations for review, an agency spokeswoman told PolitiFact Georgia. Jackson said she would make a decision on whether to tighten the rules in July, according to a Reuters news story, but she has yet to do so.Even if the EPA were to submit such regulations today, it could take a year or so for them to go into effect, said Richard Krause, a lobbyist for the American Farm Bureau Federation. The EPA would have to make any proposal available for public review and comment, a process that could take some months.So to sum up:The EPA has been regulating large particulate matter, including dust, for four decades, but does not single out farm dust or require monitoring in more rural areas.EPA staffers and scientists concluded after an assessment of the most recent science that its worthwhile to consider tightening current regulations, but the EPA has not formally proposed any regulation, and even if they did so today, it could take a while for it to go into effect.So, Cain does have a point. The EPA does regulate dust under the Clean Air Act. But Cains language was very specific, and now that the dust has settled in the wake of the Republican debate, its clear his specifics were incorrect.Dust is regulated, but not at all in the way that Cain described. We therefore rate his statement False.",0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,false

Final Rating: False  ",ACORN will be a paid partner with the Census Bureau and they will be in charge of going door-to-door and collecting data from the American public.,"Rep. Michele Bachmann sparked a new controversy recently when she declared she would provide the bare minimum to Census takers because she was concerned about the Census Bureau's partnership with ACORN, a left-leaning group that has become a popular villain for Republicans. (You remember ACORN: Formally known as the Association of Community Organization for Reform Now, it was lambasted in 2008 by many Republicans because its voter registration efforts included some fraudulent names such as Mickey Mouse. ACORN leaders said they discovered the fake names, notified authorities and fired some workers who cut corners. But Republican leaders still say it was a willful effort to manipulate the election to help the group's liberal agenda.) Here's how Bachmann explained her concerns in aWashington Timesinterview (which you can listen tohere): Now ACORN has been named one of the national partners, which will be a recipient again of federal money, Bachmann said. And they will be in charge of going door-to-door and collecting data from the American public. This is very concerning because the motherload of all data information will be from the Census. And, of course, we think of the Census as just counting how many people live in your home. Unfortunately, the Census data has become very intricate, very personal (with) a lot of the questions that are asked. And I know for my family the only question that we will be answering is how many people are in our home. We won't be answering any information beyond that, because the Constitution doesn't require any information beyond that. Bachmann packs a lot of bad information into a short space there. So in this item we'll deal with her latest claim about ACORN, and we'll deal with her claim about the constitutional requirement witha different item. She is wildly wrong with her chraracterization of the Census Bureau's partnership program. Yes, the bureaudoespartner with organizations to help recruit workers. To date, it has 30,000 such partners. ACORN is one. Partners agree to promote the 2010 Census among their constituents. As a partner, ACORN has agreed to spread the word among its people about the availability of temporary Census jobs. The U.S. Census Bureau expects to hire 1.4 million people through the course of the 2010 census, the bulk of them to do the door-to-door questionnaires, so the bureau casts a wide net to get applicants, including through its partners. Partners don't get paid, but they presumably benefit by getting the word out to members about jobs, and also by providing a public service emphasizing the importance of filling out the Census. According to Census Bureau information provided to Congress on June 1, 2009, ACORN and other partner organizations simply promote the availability of temporary Census jobs, but have no role in the terms or conditions of employment beyond promotion of the availability of temporary jobs. Applicants that are hired by the Census Bureau to work on the 2010 Census are required to go through a background check that includes an FBI name check and fingerprint check so that felons are not hired to work on the 2010 Census. Partners are also encouraged to donate testing space for the millions of people who will apply for the temporary Census jobs. No payments are made for that. And lastly, partners are asked to promote full participation in the Census among their members, through newsletters, e-mails, local meetings etc. Again, there's no payment for that. So let's count the ways Bachmann is wrong: ACORN will not be in charge of going door-to-door and collecting data from the American public, as Bachmann said. The U.S. Census will be in charge of that. Some of the 1.4 million people who get Census-taking jobs may learn about the job through ACORN. Workers who apply to the Census through ACORN have no better shot at the job than those who apply through any of the 30,000 other partners. That's it. And despite Bachmann's claim, ACORN gets no money for signing on as a partner. Once again, she is making a scaremongering claim about ACORN with facts that are ridiculously wrong. So we have to set the meter on fire once again. She earns another Pants on Fire.",0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,false

Mukwege did resign, but it wasnt for those reasons. Mukwege is a Congolese gynecologist and surgeon who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2018 along with Nadia Murad for their work to end the use of sexual violence as a weapon of war. The post displays a photo of Mukwege and claims he said this about resigning from the team: I cannot in any case dirty my Nobel Peace Prize for money, we had been ordered to declare any illness to be coronavirus and any death. In addition, the thing that displeased me is that, after more than 100 samples none came out positive. I have a career to protect and I am Congolese by blood. Getting rich by lying is a sin before God, I quit. The quote is fake. Mukwege said he resigned because of problems that included inadequate preventive measures and inefficient testing. The post was flagged as part of Facebooks efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Mukwege served as vice chairman of the Multi-sectoral Coronavirus Response Committee and president of the Health Commission, which were established in Congos South Kivu province to handle its COVID-19 pandemic response. Mukwege released a statement about his decision to resign from the committee on June 10 on the website for the Panzi Foundation, a charitable organization he founded. He said the decision was due to slow testing, problems implementing a response strategy and inadequate preventative measures. We are therefore at the start of an exponential epidemiological curve and we can no longer apply a strategy that would only be preventive, Mukwege wrote. I therefore decided to resign from my duties as Vice-President of the Multi-sectoral Coronavirus Response Committee in our province and President of the Health Commission, in order to devote myself entirely to my medical responsibilities and to treat this influx of patients at Panzi Hospital. A Panzi Foundation spokesperson also confirmed to PolitiFact that the quote is fabricated. On Twitter, Mukwege said any statements posted in his name were not genuine unless they appeared on his official social networks or websites.

According to what looks like a news headline being shared online, NASA discovered tetrahydrocannabinol, or THC —the stuff that gets marijuana users high — on a meteorite fragment. A team of astrophysicists at the University of Hawaii have created somewhat of a stir within the scientific community after the discovery of trace amounts of Tetrahydrocannabinol, reads the text below the headline. The post also cites a website: thehealthdisorder.com. This post was flagged as part of Facebooks efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed.

The University of Hawaii system has three universities, and we contacted the two where we found physics departments. University of Hawaii at Mānoa didnt respond to our questions about the post, but apparently this news that caused a stir within the scientific community didnt reach the chair of the physics and astronomy department at the University of Hawaii at Hilo. I cant help you on this one, Dr. Kathy Cooksey said. We found a Google listing for the story on thehealthdisorder.com, though when we clicked on the link the website was dead. And we didnt find any credible news stories corroborating the headline in the post. But it appears its been online for several years now.

Final Rating: False  ","It was (Rob Portmans) job to stop Chinas illegal dumping of steel. He failed, looked the other way, did nothing."," Ted Strickland goes back 11 years in an ad targeting incumbent Ohio Sen. Rob Portman, chastising his role as U.S. trade representative under President George W. Bush. It was his job to stop Chinas illegal dumping of steel, the narrator says. He failed, looked the other way, did nothing. Titled Beltway Rob, the ad is part of an ongoing name-calling battle between the Strickland and Portman campaigns. (Portman mocks Strickland as Retread Ted.) Stricklands ad left us wondering if Portman dropped the ball on foreign steel during his year as trade representative. (Dumping in trade speak typically refers to a country introducing a cheaper-than-normal product into a foreign market and edging out domestic manufacturers.) Was it really his job to stop Chinas illegal steel dumping, and did Portman really do nothing to stand up for the United States? Stricklands campaign pointed us to a 2012 Politico article about potential running mates for Mitt Romneys presidential bid. Portmans name was on the short list, the article said, but a chapter in Portmans trade history could be leveraged as a weakness by Democratic opponents. We turned to the trade wonks for more clarity. Role of trade representative So was it Portmans job to stop China's illegal dumping of steel?  In a word, no. Like a lot of political ads, its more complicated than the ad is saying, said Warren Maruyama, who served as general counsel for the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative under Portmans successor, Susan Schwab. The trade representatives job is to act as the governments spokesperson on trade, negotiate trade agreements, file cases with the World Trade Organization on behalf of domestic interests and defend against cases where those interests are challenged, and to oversee coordination with the alphabet soup of other agencies whose interests overlap with trade, Maruyama said. Trade law is arcane, and its easier to yell China bad! than it is to explain its nuances. But to a trade experts ear, it makes no sense to say that Portman failed to stop illegal Chinese dumping. Its like saying LeBron James failed to score any touchdowns last season — that's thewrong sport. Likewise, the law is very clear that the U.S. trade representative has no role in the determinations on unfair trade practices such as dumping. Determinations regarding dumping are made by the Commerce Department and the U.S. International Trade Court, in procedures which are deliberately shielded from political or outside interference. Its walled off from political considerations, and Portman could have gotten into trouble if hed tried to interfere, Maruyama said.  If dumping is proven, its an unfair trade practice for which relief is mandatory. The U.S. International Trade Commission decides if there is injury or the threat of injury, and the Commerce Department determines the appropriate relief, through higher tariffs. Alan Wolff, who was deputy special representative for trade negotiations during President Jimmy Carters administration, agreed. Portman had no role on anti-dumping, he said. Thats flat-out wrong. The attack ad copy is conflating two different issues, Wolff said. The case referenced by Politico, the one that the Strickland ad wants to use as proof of Portmans inaction on Chinese dumping, didnt involve market-dumping at all. The case at hand is different In August 2005, American makers of circular welded non-alloy steel pipe, which is often used in home-building, filed for relief from market disruption under Section 421 of the Trade Act of 1974. Market disruption is not the same as dumping. Trade experts draw a firm distinction between the two terms.(When theWall Street Journalmischaracterized a similar 2009 market disruption case as a dumping case, the paper rana correction.) There is a clear difference, Maruyama said. The thing about dumping is it sounds bad, so people throw it around, but its just not accurate. Section 421 is a unique and rarely used statute, according to Schwab, who took over for Portman after Bush tapped him to head the U.S. Office of Management and Budget. Cases under this statute for market disruptionfall under a category of safeguard considerations, where it is not necessary for the petitioner to prove wrongdoing, only that a trade action has caused them injury, or threat of injury. Its a way of bypassing a formal dumping hearing by the trade commission, Schwab said. Section 421 cases are also unique in that they require approval from the White House. The president, the law says, must determine whether trade relief measures are in the countrys economic interest, or could threaten national security. In October 2005, the International Trade Commission issued its determination on the steel pipe case. Four of six trade commissioners sided with the steel pipe manufacturers and recommended tariffs and safeguard actions be imposed on Chinas pipe imports. Two commissioners dissented, finding no market disruption. Here, it was Portmans job to coordinate the process where representatives from other agencies weigh in. They all sit down and argue, Maruyama said, and if they have a consensus, thats the recommendation that goes up to the president. If there are differences, and often there are, it goes over to the White House in a memo summarizing all the pros and cons. And then Bush gets to decide.  Portman had a Cabinet role in this occasion, but Schwab said Bush was very clear that there was only one decider in his administration. It wasnt a Portman-Bush decision, she said. It was a Bush decision. Bush did not impose relief in this case, or in three other 421 cases that crossed his desk when Portman wasnt his trade representative. In the steel pipe case, Bush said that relief wasnt in the national economic interest. He believed that punishing China on steel pipe wouldnt ultimately help U.S. steel manufacturers. There are many other countries currently supplying standard pipe to the U.S. market that could fill the void created by curtailed Chinese imports, wrotePortman in a February 2006 letterto Sen. Blanche Lincoln, D-Ark., one of many lawmakers catching heat from angry steel industry constituents. Schwab called attacks on Portmans record on China ironic. Portman was always my strongest ally when I wanted to take the Chinese to the WTO, she said. He was a hawk on these issues. If I wanted to file trade enforcement cases on China I could always count on him. Our ruling Stricklands ad says that it was Portmans job to stop Chinas illegal dumping of steel. He failed, looked the other way, did nothing. We consulted trade experts on both sides of the partisan aisle. They were unanimous that the ads statement is fundamentally wrong.Portman did not have a role to play in anti-dumping measures as U.S. trade representative. The 2005 trade matter that the ad attacks him over had nothing to do with dumping. This case only reached Portman, and ultimately Bush, because it was filed underanother part of trade law that triggers presidential involvement that isn't used for true dumping cases. Andif you switched Bush for Portman in this ad, it would still be a cynical twisting of words. Dumping is not a catch-all for Chinese steelinthe market.",0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,false

Final Rating: False  ",James Comey Memos just out and show clearly that there was NO COLLUSION and NO OBSTRUCTION,"President Donald Trump claimed that memos written by former FBI Director James Comey show clearly that the Trump campaign did not collude with Russia during the 2016 election, and that Trump has not obstructed justice amid ensuing investigations. Comey, who Trump removed as FBI director in 2017, made detailed notes following seven encounters with Trump. Comey had testified before Congress about portions of the memos, but they became public in their entirety for the first time on April 19, which prompted Trump to claim the memos cleared his name. James Comey Memos just out and show clearly that there was NO COLLUSION and NO OBSTRUCTION, Trump tweeted.  James Comey Memos just out and show clearly that there was NO COLLUSION and NO OBSTRUCTION. Also, he leaked classified information. WOW! Will the Witch Hunt continue? Comey has said he made written records of his meetings with Trump in part due to concerns the president might lie about their discussions. Here, Trumps tweetbadly mischaracterizes their contents. Nowhere in Comeys memos does he say that Trump did not collude or obstruct justice. Lets recap how the memos came to be. In July 2016, when Comey was still FBI director, the FBI opened a counterintelligence investigation into links between the Trump campaign and the Russian government. After Trump was elected, Comey made contemporaneous notes of seven discussions he had with Trump. On May 9, 2017, Trump fired Comey as FBI director. From this point forward, Comey would have no role investigating Trump campaign ties to Russia. Later that month, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein appointed former FBI Director Robert Mueller as special counsel. Mueller was authorized to lead the investigation into possible connections between the Trump campaign and Russian officials, as well as other matters that may arise directly from the investigation. (Rosenstein was acting as attorney general in place of Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who recused himself from the investigation.) Heres the key point: After the reins were passed from Comey to Mueller, the investigation into contacts between the Trump campaign and Russia escalated dramatically. Comey wasnt in any position to make definitive statements about whether collusion existed or not. To date, Muellers investigation has swept up four members of Trumps campaign, including three who have agreed to work with Muellers team as part of a plea deal. Muellers probe is ongoing, and he has yet to issue a final determination on the collusion question. The idea that the memos exonerate Trump on charges of obstruction of justice is even weaker. For starters, Comeys memos contain details that many experts would consider legally relevant in an obstruction case against Trump. The memos describe a one-on-one dinner with Trump on Jan. 27, 2017, at the White House, where Trump turned the conversation to whether Comey wanted to stay on as FBI director. Comey has said he suspected Trump was seeking a patronage relationship with him. Comeys memo goes on to state that Trump explicitly requested his loyalty later that evening, saying, I need loyalty, I expect loyalty. The memos also describe a private meeting at the White House the following month, in which Trump asked Comey to drop the investigation into former national security adviser Michael Flynn, saying, I hope you can see your way clear to letting this go. Finally, two days after Comeys ouster, Trump said in a nationally televised interview that hed been thinking about the FBIs Russia investigation when he fired Comey. When I decided to just do it, I said to myself, I said you know, this Russia thing with Trump and Russia is a made-up story, Trump told NBCs Lester Holt. As in the case of the collusion question, Mueller has yet to issue a final determination on whether Trump obstructed justice. Even when the Comey memos are read in a light most favorable to Trump, they still dont support his claim that the writings exonerate him. Comeys memos show Trump repeatedly asking for his help to lift the cloud being cast over his presidency by the Russia probe. Comey writes that he reassured Trump multiple times that the FBI was not investigating him. But Comeys final memo was written more than a year ago, before Mueller ramped up the investigation and before Trump admitted he had been thinking about the Russia investigation when he fired Comey. More recently, Comey addressed the investigation in his memoir A Higher Loyalty, where he holds open the possibility of criminal wrongdoing: One of the pivotal questions I presume that Bob Muellers team is investigating is whether or not in urging me to back the FBI off our investigation of his national security adviser and in firing me, President Trump was attempting to obstruct justice, which is a federal crime. Its certainly possible. There is at least circumstantial evidence in that regard, and there may be more that the Mueller team will assemble. Trump said the Comey memos show clearly that there was no collusion and no obstruction of justice. Nowhere in Comeys memos does he say that Trump did not collude nor obstruct justice. And in the year since Comey penned his last Trump memo, a special counsel has been appointed who has escalated the investigation. That investigation has resulted in other charges against four members of Trumps campaign, including three who have agreed to plea deals. In his book, Comey writes that thememosand the circumstances of his firingmay be legally relevant to an obstruction case against Trump. Comey has also held open the possibility that Trump may ultimately be found to have committed criminal wrongdoing. ",0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,false

Final Rating: False  ",Says giving Motrin and Robitussin together can cause heart attacks in children.,"Dubious medical advice is not only plentiful on social media – its persistent. Such is the case for a decade-old email chain that warns against giving children a combination of Motrin and Robitussin, because they may have a heart attack. One example of the claim, which has been popping up in email inboxes since at least 2008, has gotten over 115,000 shares on Facebook and says that an 8-year-old girl named Madison passed away after she was allegedly given both medications: This was sent to us from a nurse in our district  thought Id pass along just as an FYI. Motrin and Robitussin dont mix!!! Madison, age 8, passed away just a few days ago. Weve been asked to pass this on. Doctors told her family that there have been quite a few children Madisons age that have died recently the same way that she did. The only common link between them was that they were given Motrin (ibuprofen) and Robitussin together, this caused a heart attack. They believe this is what happened to them. They told her to alert everyone to this. Do not give children both of these medicines together. You can give them one or the other but not both. When Madison collapsed she suffered a heart attack and they were able to revive her but the loss of oxygen damaged her brain and she was put on the respirator. After this she had four strokes before she died after being taken off the respirator. Please pass this on !!!!!!!!! The bottom of the post has the email signature: Lisa Lopez M.A. Childrens Medical Center of Dallas Pulmonary Clinic. The post was flagged as part of Facebooks efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) This rumor is just that –– a rumor. There is no evidence to suggest that a Motrin-Robitussin combination causes heart attacks in otherwise healthy children. The Childrens Medical Center in Dallas, Texas, that appeared in the email signature came out to dispel the rumor in 2010, roughly a year after it started being shared. The hospitals announcement said the following: In 2009, a Childrens employee received the e-mail from a friend and inadvertently forwarded it from a work account. Because the employees professional signature was included at the bottom of the e-mail, the information appeared to come from a reliable source at Childrens Medical Center. This is not the case. All medications have side effects, the hospital noted, and parents of children with underlying medical conditions must always be vigilant about the medications their child is taking. The hospital statement advised parents to consult with their childrens doctor or a pharmacist before mixing any over-the-counter drugs. The Childrens Medical Center also addressed the rumor in a tweet on Dec. 22, 2014: Facebook post about Motrin & Robitussin is not correct & was not posted by one of our employees. The tweet linked to a 2009 fact-check by Snopes on the topic. Its important to note that the Food and Drug Administration does not recommend children under the age of two be given cough-cold medications. But the agency has not issued any warnings that the ingredients in Motrin (which contains ibuprofen) or Robitussin (which contains dextromethorphan and/or pseudoephedrine or sometimes chlorpheniramine) could cause heart attacks in children when combined. These ingredients are also in many other medications on the market, yet the chain email only singles out Motrin and Robitussin. If the danger of heart attacks, strokes or death was prevalent in the combination of two commonly used medications, health officials would have issued widespread public health warnings. Motrin alone is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug, and according to the FDA, the labels of over-the-counter versions warn that for adults and children (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs), except aspirin, increase the risk of heart attack, heart failure, and stroke. These can be fatal. The risk is higher if you use more than directed or for longer than directed. Ashley Turney, an FDA spokesperson for over-the-counter drugs, told PolitiFact that use of Robitussin products, with or without Motrin, is not associated with heart attacks. She described Robitussin as an umbrella brand containing a series of childrens cough and cold products that may contain a single ingredient or combinations of dextromethorphan hydrobromide, guaifenesin, phenylephrine hydrochloride, or chlorpheniramine maleate. The recommended use, dosing, and warnings vary amongst the seven Robitussin products that are intended for use in children over 4 or 6 years, she said. Turney noted that its important for people to read the drug facts label directions for all over-the-counter medications. An old rumor claims combining Motrin and Robitussin can cause heart attacks in children. There is no evidence that giving both of these medications to children causes heart attacks. Children who are too young or have underlying medical conditions can experience adverse side effects from taking any combination of over-the-counter medicine, health officials say. Parents are recommended to talk with their childs health care provider, or a pharmacist, if they have any questions about mixing medications.

Final Rating: False  ","Rep. David Cicilline is responsible for the federal loan guarantee to Solyndra, the failed solar company","Theres been a lot of finger-pointing lately in Washington over the Obama administrations 2009 decision to give a $535-million federal loan guarantee to Solyndra, a now-defunct solar power manufacturer.The Republican-controlled House has launched an investigation into how the Department of Energy could guarantee such a large loan to a company that would file for bankruptcy only two and a half years later. What sort of examination of the California start-up companys finances did the government do before taking such a big risk?According to a news release we received the other day, the National Republican Congressional Committee has found a scapegoat for the debacle: U.S. Rep. David N. Cicilline, Democrat of Rhode Island.Once the poster child for David Cicilline's stimulus boondoggle, the bankrupt Solyndra company is now a symbol of how his failed scheme wasted taxpayer money on political payback and failing companies instead of creating the jobs promised, the Jan. 13 release said.The NRCC sent out the release in response to a Washington Times report that senior Solyndra executives were set to receive bonuses despite the companys troubles.Its outrageous enough that David Cicilline supported a $1-trillion failed stimulus package, but its even more outrageous that hundreds of millions were spent to fund a failing company like Solyndra, NRCC communications director Paul Lindsay went on to say in the release. Not only is Cicilline responsible for this irresponsible investment, but hell also have to explain to his Rhode Island constituents why Solyndras senior employees are receiving bonuses at the expense of hard-working American taxpayers.Weve heard a lot of allegations in connection to Solyndras problems, but never one laying the blame at Cicillines doorstep. This puzzled us because Cicilline took office in 2011, well after the federal stimulus package that financed Solyndras loan guarantee was passed and well after the decision was made to award Solyndra the loan guarantee. How could he be responsible?We checked the NRCCs website and saw that the same news release had been sent out to 49 other Congressional districts, but each time, the name of the Democrat in office was inserted where Cicillines name was. (The Democrats included Rep. Bill Keating, of Massachusetts, who also took office in 2011).We then called the organization seeking an explanation of how Cicilline made it on the list. (Curiously, Rep. James R. Langevin, Rhode Islands other congressman who is also a Democrat, wasnit on the list even though he was in office at the time the stimulus bill was passed and voted for it.)An NRCC spokesman said the release was accurate because Cicilline voiced support for the stimulus package when he was campaigning for Congress.I think the important thing to note is we didnt say Cicilline voted for the stimulus, Nat Sillin said. We say he supported it.Its true that Cicilline did back the stimulus package. When he was mayor of Providence, he was quoted numerous times saying that the bill would create sorely needed jobs.And although its technically true that the release didnt say that Cicilline voted for the stimulus, it did say that hes responsible. That didnt add up to us. Lets run through some dates to make it clear why:Feb. 13, 2009: Congress passes the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. Under the $787-billion stimulus package, Solyndra received its loan guarantee.March 20, 2009: Solyndra receives conditional approval for the loan guarantee, according to a timeline from the Department of Energ,.Sept. 3, 2009: The Department of Energy makes the final decision to approve the loan guarantee for Solyndra.Nov. 2, 2010: Cicilline elected to Congress.Jan. 5, 2011: Cicilline takes office.Our rulingThe full name of the legislation under which the stimulus package was approved gives this one away -- the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009.Cicilline took office in January 2011, a full 23 months after passage of the bill enacting the loan guarantee program that benefited Solyndra.The National Republican Congressional Committee has every right to call the stimulus a boondoggle. And its fair to say that Cicilline supported the stimulus before taking office.But Lindsay said that Cicilline is responsible for this irresponsible investment. No, hes not.Wed say that Lindsay and the National Republican Congressional Committee simply used overheated rhetoric, but thats an understatement. Their claim is so wildly inaccurate that we give it a Pants on Fire. (Get updates from PolitiFactRI on Twitter.

We did extensive searches on Google, in the Lexis-Nexis news database and the White Houses own website, as well as checking with a few experts.

In fact, several of the statements are directly contradicted by the evidence we found.Well take the quotes one by one.2008: Navy Seal Team 6 is Cheney's private assassination team.We found occasional references in the media to assassination teams that were answerable to Vice President Dick Cheney, but no evidence that Obama ever said anything of the sort.In a March 11, 2009, speech at the University of Minnesota, veteran investigative reporter Seymour Hersh referred to the Joint Special Operations Command -- a special wing of our special operations community that is set up independently, as he put it. They do not report to anybody, except in the Bush-Cheney days, they reported directly to the Cheney office. ... Congress has no oversight of it. Its an executive assassination ring essentially....Later, during the July 15, 2009, edition of Countdown with Keith Olbermann -- a now-defunct nightly show on MSNBC -- the liberal host introduced a segment by saying that it was time to look at what we know about the Bush-Cheney assassination teams. The segment addressed purported assassination efforts under both the CIA and the Pentagon. The latter sent killing teams into the field, where they actually killed people, including those affiliated with al-Qaida, Olbermann said.Almost two years later, such comments became somewhat prescient, when details of the bin Laden raid became known. The counter-terrorist team that carried out the raid was the Naval Special Warfare Development Group, or DevGru for short. (The team is popularly, though incorrectly, known by one of its several former names, SEAL Team Six.) DevGru has been around since the early 1980s, usually shrouded in secrecy given its sensitive work. According to globalsecurity.org, it is a component of the Joint Special Operations Command.From whats been reported, its unclear whether DevGru truly was answerable to Cheney during his two terms as vice president. But the group existed, and the bin Laden raid certainly suggests that it has the ability -- at least in some cases -- to act as an assassination team.Still, the e-mail is wrong to suggest that Obama ever said or wrote that Navy Seal Team 6 is Cheney's private assassination team before he became president (or, for that matter, after).2011: I put together Seal Team 6 to take out Bin Laden.During his May 1, 2011, announcement of bin Ladens death, Obama detailed his role in ordering the bin Laden raid. But he never claimed that he had created the unit that carried out the raid (which he didnt, in any case).Obama said in his announcement that shortly after he took office, I directed Leon Panetta, the director of the CIA, to make the killing or capture of bin Laden the top priority of our war against al-Qaida, even as we continued our broader efforts to disrupt, dismantle, and defeat his network.  Last week, I determined that we had enough intelligence to take action, and authorized an operation to get Osama bin Laden and bring him to justice.Today, at my direction, the United States launched a targeted operation against that compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan. A small team of Americans carried out the operation with extraordinary courage and capability. No Americans were harmed. They took care to avoid civilian casualties. After a firefight, they killed Osama bin Laden and took custody of his body.In a lengthy interview conducted on May 4, 2011, Obama sounded a similar note.Obviously we have extraordinary guys, Obama told Steve Kroft of the CBS newsmagazine 60 Minutes. Our Special Forces are the best of the best. And so I was not involved in designing the initial plan. But each iteration of that plan they'd bring back to me. Make a full presentation. We would ask questions. We had multiple meetings in the Situation Room in which we would map out -- and we would actually have a model of the compound and discuss how this operation might proceed, and what various options there were because there was more than one way in which we might go about this.We did not find any evidence that Obama had claimed to have created the special forces team that carried out the raid.2008: Bin Laden is innocent until proven guilty and must be captured alive and given a fair trial.Obama never said this. In fact, he took the opposite stance in one of the presidential debates in 2008.If we have Osama bin Laden in our sights and the Pakistani government is unable or unwilling to take them out, then I think that we have to act, and we will take them out, Obama said. We will kill bin Laden. We will crush al-Qaida. That has to be our biggest national security priority.The closest we could find was a comment -- quickly retracted -- that was made in 2003 by Howard Dean. Dean, the former governor of Vermont, was running for the Democratic presidential nomination at the time.In December 2003, Dean told the Concord Monitor that he had resisted pronouncing a sentence (on bin Laden) before guilt is found. I still have this old-fashioned notion that even with people like Osama, who is very likely to be found guilty, we should do our best not to, in positions of executive power, not to prejudge jury trials.After a flurry of condemnations, Dean reversed course just a few hours later. He told the Associated Press that, as an American, I want to make sure he gets the death penalty he deserves. He also issued a statement that said in part, Bin Laden has admitted that he is responsible for killing 3,000 Americans as well as scores of men, women and children around the world. This is exactly the kind of case that the death penalty is meant for.2011: I authorized Seal Team 6 to kill Bin Laden.Obama didnt use the phrasing cited in the chain e-mail, but as we indicated earlier, theres no question that he took responsibility for ordering the raid.There is evidence that U.S. forces would have accepted a surrender by bin Laden, rather than killing him, under certain circumstances. After the raid, according to ABC News, State Department legal adviser Harold Koh wrote in a blog post that forces were prepared to capture bin Laden if he had surrendered in a way that they could safely accept in accordance with the laws of armed conflict which require the acceptance of a genuine offer of surrender, clearly communicated by the surrendering party under circumstances where it would be feasible for the forces to accept the offer of surrender.Still, Koh wrote that bin Laden was a lawful target under the Authorization for Use of Military Force passed by Congress in 2001. It allows military force against those that have planned, authorized, committed or aided the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001.2008: Guantanamo is entirely unnecessary, and the detainees should not be interrogated.This statement has a grain of truth, but it is exaggerated.During the campaign, Obama made no secret of his disagreement with elements of the Bush Administrations national security policy. He promised to close the detention facility at Guantanamo (which we have rated a Promise Broken) and to end the use of torture without exception (which we have rated In the Works).Obamas desire to close Guantanamo could be construed as him believing that the facility is entirely unnecessary, but its wrong to say that he believed that detainees shouldnt be interrogated. Interrogation is a standard procedure in law enforcement and intelligence. Obama wanted to end the use of torture.We also found no evidence that Obama uttered these words.2011: Vital intelligence was obtained from Guantanamo detainees that led to our locating Bin Laden.Some, including Cheney, have suggested that the Bin Laden raid benefited from intelligence gained through interrogation techniques that Obama has criticized as torture. This question has not been definitively settled, although the White House downplayed the possibility.Reporting from detainees was just a slice of the information that has been gathered by incredibly diligent professionals over the years in the intelligence community, White House spokesman Jay Carney said on May 3, 2011. And it simply strains credulity to suggest that a piece of information that may or may not have been gathered in -- eight years ago somehow directly led to a successful mission on Sunday. That's just not the case.John Pike, the director of globalsecurity.org, said that the words attributed to Obama on Guantanamo are ludicrous. It is not something he would have said, and there is no evidence that it is something that he did say.And in this case too, we found no evidence that Obama uttered the words attributed to him. As you may know I have been critical of Obama's national security policies, said Professor Jeff Addicott, director of the Center for Terrorism Law at St. Mary's University School of Law. That said, I have never heard him make the 2008 remarks, and I follow him very closely.Our ruling A few of the sentiments have some link to reality – Obama did order the raid to kill bin Laden, and he did oppose Guantanamo, even though he ultimately failed to carry through on his promise to close it. The critics may have wished Obama had made these statements, but appears the statements have no basis in reality. It's clear from our research that all six quotes are fabrications. Once again a widely circulated chain e-mail is spreading ridiculous falsehoods about Obama.",0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,false

Final Rating: False","An ongoing audit of the 2020 presidential election in Arizona showed Trump ahead by 250,000 votes, and nearly 950,000 ballots are declared illegal, nearly all for Biden.","In the 2020 election, 3,385,294 votes were cast for president in Arizona, and Donald Trump lost the state to Joe Biden by just 10,457 votes — 49.36% to 49.06%. Six months later, a livestreamed but opaque audit of ballots from the states most populous county is under way in a 14,870-seat arena. And posts on social media falsely suggest that the audit showed Trump was overtaking Biden. A widely shared Instagram post claimed: Preliminary audit showed Trump ahead by 250,000. Now as it nears completion nearly 950,000 ballots are declared illegal. Nearly all for Biden. The post was flagged as part of Facebooks efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Theres no preliminary results, Ken Bennett, Arizonas former secretary of state and a liaison for the Senate Republicans who ordered the audit, told PolitiFact on May 6. Theres no such finding. Theres been no findings released to either of those effects. The audit, begun April 23, will likely to continue for at least 60 days, Bennett said. He added that under the contract for the audit, no preliminary findings are to be released. A spokesperson for the audit did not reply to our email. Final official results of the November election showed Biden beat Trump in Maricopa County, 1,040,774 votes to 995,665, or by about 2% of the vote. So the Instagram claim would have you believe that the audit found roughly 90% of Bidens votes were illegal. The Maricopa audit was ordered up by Republican state senators, even though the original result has been validated by a hand-count sample audit and a forensic audit of tabulation equipment that found no abnormalities. The GOP hired a team that included Cyber Ninjas, a Florida-based technology company lacking election audit experience. Cyber Ninjas is headed by Doug Logan, who promoted stop the steal conspiracy theories about the election that culminated in the Jan. 6 Capitol attack. The conservative One America News Network, which has aired falsehoods about the 2020 election, set up a nine-camera livestream for the audit, which is being conducted at Veterans Memorial Coliseum in Phoenix. But Cyber Ninjas policies and procedures were released only after a judge ruled that the firm couldnt keep them secret. Reporters initially were restricted from taking notes or filing reports. The false claim follows others that weve debunked about purported findings from the audit. We also rated False a claim that the audit is confirming the rumors that real ballots have a special watermark. Theres no evidence of any such finding, and Maricopa County says it does not use watermarks on its ballots. A widely shared social media post claimed that an ongoing audit of the 2020 presidential election in Arizona showed Trump ahead by 250,000 votes, and nearly 950,000 ballots are declared illegal, nearly all for Biden. No findings have been released from an ongoing audit of the 2020 presidential election in Maricopa County, Ariz., that is being conducted by firms hired by Arizona Senate Republicans. There is no evidence that the audit has turned up any illegal ballots or changes in votes that would give Trump the lead in Arizona.

Final Rating: False  ",The war in Ukraine is scripted and staged.,"Russias military invasion of Ukraine has brought on an onslaught of attacks, injuries and deaths for more than a week. But according to one claim on Facebook, the war is fake. The Feb. 25 post showed a photo of the Joker from the Batman film, The Dark Knight', with text overlaid that read, Them: Lets pray for Ukraine! Me: Its all scripted and staged. The accompanying text post read, Russia and Ukraine is a coverup! and linked to a nine-minute YouTube video that falsely claimed the war is a coverup to distract from COVID-19, which it says was also planned and staged. The post was flagged as part of Facebooks efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) First off, COVID-19 is real. PolitiFact named claims to the contrary its 2020 Lie of the Year. Statistical data, hospitals, medical workers, news reports and more show that the pandemic is authentic, and has caused millions to get sick or die. As for war in Ukraine, daily evidence proves that there is indeed a war. During the early morning of Feb. 24, after months of increased Russian military presence near the Ukrainian border, President Vladimir Putin announced the invasion into Ukraine in a televised speech, calling it a special military operation. Following Russian missile strikes on Feb. 24, 2022, a destroyed car, damaged radar and equipment are shown at a Ukrainian military facility outside Mariupol, Ukraine. (AP Photo) Before the Russian invasion, numerous Ukrainian civilians volunteered to become fighters and took part in military training. Now, theyre on the frontline. NPR, The New York Times and other news sources have extensively covered the situation in Ukraine, where journalists and citizens have transmitted images depicting the war effort. This picture, my God. https://t.co/8m2EDk8cBb pic.twitter.com/YW8dZ2fI04 The exact number of civilians killed is unknown, but as of March 2, Ukraines State Emergency Service estimated more than 2,000 Ukrainians dead, according to CNN. On March 4, the United Nations gave a lower count of 331 people killed, including 19 children, and 675 who were injured. But the real toll is likely to be much higher, Liz Throssell, U.N. spokesperson, said. The U.N. reported that most civilian deaths in the first eight days of conflict were caused by the use of explosive weapons with a wide impact area, including shelling from heavy artillery and multi-launch rocket systems, and missile and air strikes. Russia has also reported casualties. The Russian Defense Ministry announced that 498 Russian troops have died and 1,597 more have been injured, NPR reported. With the impact of the war on civilians being publicly reported, and both sides reporting troops deaths and injuries, the claim that any of this is being staged proves to be baseless. Even more evidence that the conflict is real: the swift response from other countries. NATO has stated they will not engage in the war, but have taken other means of action against Russia. The United States, the European Union and the United Kingdom have joined together in implementing harsh economic sanctions against the Russian economy. During his State of the Union Address on March 1, President Joe Biden announced that, in addition to cutting off Russia's largest banks from the international banking system, the U.S. will join our allies in closing off American air space to all Russian flights – further isolating Russia – and adding an additional squeeze on their economy. The value of the ruble, Russias currency, has fallen to less than one U.S. cent. Rising prices on some products like electronics and appliances have caused citizens to stock up, and NPR reports that arrests of anti-war protesters in Russia are racking up. They cite a Russian human rights group called OVD-Info, whove counted more than 8,000 arrests. Wealthy elites, who also face sanctions, have criticized Putins invasion of Ukraine. Scott Radnitz, an associate professor of Russian and Eurasian studies at the University of Washington, viewed the Facebook post and video, and said that the claim hinges on a world domination conspiracy theory — but there is no evidence presented for why or how the war is being staged. There is little to refute directly, other than to note that thousands or millions of people would have to be in on any conspiracy to fake a war, and like the 9/11 attacks (which some people also deny) there is substantial video footage of attacks on Ukrainian cities, Russian invading forces, and throngs of refugees, Radnitz said. Nevertheless, he added, a true believer will persist in denying all that evidence, something that is easier to do when the conflict is geographically distant and they do not personally know anyone directly affected by it. With a war raging, the world responding and both sides of the conflict experiencing its effects, the claim that the Russian invasion of Ukraine is scripted and staged holds no merit",0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,false

Final Rating: False  ",An anonymous e-mail says that Hillary Clinton advocates communism.,"An anonymous chain e-mail maligns Hillary Clinton in the form of a gotcha-style quiz. The quiz lists six quotations, then asks which famous communist said it. Choices include Karl Marx, Josef Stalin, Mao Tse-tung and other Nazis, fascists and dictators. (We'll leave aside as a minor quibble the fact that communism and Nazism are completely different political philosophies.) Every quotation includes a none of the above option. At the end of quiz, the punch line is thatallthe answers are none of the above — Hillary Clinton said those things! Get it? The problem with the quiz is that every statement is either taken out of context or edited to look worse than it is. In none of the circumstances was Clinton advocating communist-style government for the United States or socialistic economic policies. In some instances she was criticizing out-of-control government spending or the excesses of Big Business; at other times she was saying that complicated issues will require political consensus. Let's look at the quiz items one by one. • From the chain e-mail: We're going to take things away from you on behalf of the common good. This is from 2004 remarks that Clinton made to a roomful of Democratic donors, some of whom paid $10,000 to attend the function, according to the Associated Press. She was discussing the need to end the Bush tax cuts in order to balance the budget. Her full quote was, We're not coming to you, many of whom are well enough off that actually the tax cuts may have helped you, and say 'We're going to give you more.' We're saying, 'You know what, for America to get back on track and be fiscally responsible, we're probably going to cut that short and not give it to you. We're going to take things away from you on behalf of the common good. '  • From the chain e-mail: It's time for a new beginning, for an end to government of the few, by the few, and for the few. ... And to replace it with shared responsibility for shared prosperity. In this one, Clinton was giving a speech in May 2007 attacking the economic policies of the Bush administration. She slammed subsidies for oil and gas companies, tax incentives for companies that move jobs overseas, and excessive CEO pay, according to a report in theConcord (N.H.) Monitor. Notice the italicized phrases that were left out of the chain e-mail quote: It's time for a new beginning, for an end to government of the few, by the few and for the few.Time to reject the idea of an on-your-own societyand replace it with shared responsibility for shared prosperity.I prefer a we're-all-in-it-together society. • From the chain e-mail: (We) ... can't just let business as usual go on, and that means something has to be taken away from some people. Clinton was speaking at a forum on religion and public life hosted by CNN in June 2007. This quote was in reply to a question from a Catholic priest, who asked, In an age in which there is, oftentimes, narrow and excessive individualism, how will you speak to our country about the need for sacrifice, restraint, when it comes to the critical issues of taxes, gun control, health care, and energy consumption? Here's Clinton's more complete response about energy: You know, we can't keep talking about our dependence on foreign oil and the need to deal with global warming and the challenge that it poses to our climate and to God's creation and just let business as usual go on. And that means something has to be taken away from some people. • From the chain e-mail: We have to build a political consensus and that requires people to give up a little bit of their own ... in order to create this common ground. This quote is from the same CNN forum and question mentioned above, but on the health care issue. Clinton's full quote is a little more verbose and concerns the uninsured: I think we could reach that agreement, and then we would have to start doing the hard work of deciding what we were going to do to make sure that they were not uninsured, because an uninsured person who goes to the hospital is more likely to die than an insured person. I mean, that is a fact. So what do we do? We have to build a political consensus, and that requires people giving up a little bit of their own turf in order to create this common ground. • From the chain e-mail: I certainly think the free market has failed. This might be the most egregious of the quiz quotes, because it's taken from a long list of institutions that Clinton says have failed to help kids make good decisions. Clinton was responding to a question, again at the CNN forum, about how antiabortion and proabortion forces can work together to reduce abortions. Clinton said it was important for everyone to help teens make better decisions: We have so many young people who are tremendously influenced by the media culture and by the celebrity culture, and who have a very difficult time trying to sort out the right decisions to make. And I personally believe that the adult society has failed those people. I mean, I think that we have failed them in our churches, our schools, our government. And I certainly think the, you know, free market has failed. We have all failed. • From the chain e-mail: I think it's time to send a clear message to what has become the most profitable sector in (the) entire economy that they are being watched. Clinton's target here was oil companies. She alleged that they were gouging consumers by raising prices after Hurricane Katrina hit New Orleans, according to a 2005Washington Poststory. I think it's time to send a clear message to what has become the most profitable sector in our entire economy that they're being watched, she said in explaining her call for an inquiry by the Federal Trade Commission. I think human nature left to itself is going to push the limit as far as possible, and that's what you need a government regulatory system for: to keep an eye on people to make the rules of the game fair, to make a level playing field and not give anybody some kind of undue advantage. So is Hillary Clinton advocating communism? Hardly. The masked e-mailer hopes you might think so after reading a political tyrants' Hall of Fame list alongside truncated quotes about taking things away and the collective good. We give the mock quiz a failing grade, with extra points deducted for unabashed fearmongering. Its argument that Clinton advocates Marxism is not just False, it's Pants-on-Fire wrong.

Final Rating: False  ",Most likely the primary control knob (for the earths temperature) is the ocean waters and this environment that we live in.,"Energy Secretary Rick Perry downplayed the role of human activity in the recent rise in the Earths temperature, saying natural causes are likely the main driver of climate change. Perry was asked in a CNBC interview if he believed carbon dioxide was the primary control knob for the earths temperature. No. Most likely the primary control knob is the ocean waters and this environment that we live in, Perry said in the June 19 interview. We decided to investigate Perrys claim about climate changes main cause, which scientists have likened to a control knob. Perrys claim flies in the face of settled science. The worlds leading authority on climate change, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, has concluded that human activity is extremely likely to be the main driver of warming since the mid 20th century. While its still possible to find dissenters, scientists around the globe generally agree with this conclusion. The graph below, based on work by NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies, shows just how closely human activity syncs with the earths rising temperature, especially since 1950. The blue line shows how human factors (land use, ozone, aerosols and greenhouse gases) have contributed to global warming. The black line is the Earths recorded temperature since 1880.  This is not to say natural factors dont affect the climate. They do. But Perry is wrong to call them the main cause of the earths rising temperature. When you look at how natural causes (orbital and solar changes plus volcanic activity) have contributed to climate change, its clear the impact is less than that of human factors.  Perry is also wrong to say ocean waters are responsible for the uptick in temperature. While oceans are a vital part of the climate system, and variations in their circulation can affect local climates in important ways, they dont account for global warming, said Gavin Schmidt, climatologist and director of NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies. We have concluded close to all of the recent trends in global temperature is due to human activity, and CO2 is the dominant factor, Schmidt said, referring to carbon dioxide. Perry misidentified climate changes main control knob, but hes not the first Trump administration department head to fudge the facts on our warming planet. We previously issued a False rating to Environmental Protection Agency chief Scott Pruitts claim that carbon dioxide is not a primary contributor to the global warming that we see. In fact, carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas that collects in the earths atmosphere and traps excess heat. It has functioned like a primary control knob thats been dialed up dramatically since humans began releasing significantly more amounts of CO2 into the air, mostly by burning fossil fuels, at the dawn of the Industrial Revolution. A reasonable analogy can be drawn between the way that atmospheric CO2 controls the global temperature of the Earth, and how your house thermostat controls the temperature of your house, said Andrew Lacis, a climatologist at NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies. The NASA graph below shows the influence of greenhouse gas emissions, including a 40 percent increase in atmospheric CO2 since 1750 (green line), on the Earths temperature (black line).  Energy Secretary Rick Perry said, Most likely the primary control knob (for the earths temperature) is the ocean waters and this environment that we live in. Perrys claim contradicts settled science. While natural factors certainly affect the climate, human factors are the main contributor to global warming, and carbon dioxide has acted as the primary control knob governing the earths relatively recent uptick in temperature.

Final Rating: False",Under the Obama plan . . . all the health care in this country is eventually going to be run by the government.,"When Sen. Tom Coburn said that under President Obama, all the health care in this country is eventually going to be run by the government, it was like a golden oldie PolitiFact has heard many times before. During the campaign, we heard the same tune from vice presidential candidateSarah Palin, who said Obama was calling for a government-run plan;Mitt Romney, who said Obama wants the government to take over health care; andRudy Giuliani, who called Hillary Clinton's similar plan socialized medicine.) Coburn, an Oklahoma Republican, made his remarks while criticizing Obama on a different matter. Obama is moving to rescind Bush administration rules that protected medical workers from performing procedures such as abortion that conflicted with their religious or moral beliefs. Coburn, who is against abortion, said rescinding the order would be only a first step for the Obama administration. Remember, under the Obama plan . . . all the health care in this country is eventually going to be run by the government, Coburn said in an interview on Fox News on March 4, 2009. So it's part of an incremental creep towards eliminating any objection, both as us as taxpayers and then individual physicians in terms of not complying with a government-run bureaucracy, he added. Coburn and Obama can fairly disagree about conscience protections for health care workers who oppose abortions. But he's wrong that Obama's plan offers government-run health care. In fact, Obama's plan leaves in place the private health care system, but seeks to expand it to the uninsured. It increases eligibility for the poor and children to enroll in initiatives like Medicaid and the State Childrens Health Insurance Program, and creates pools for individuals to buy their own cheaper insurance. It also outlines strategies to rein in costs for everyone, such as electronic medical records and preventive care. I think most of us would agree that if we want to cover all Americans, we can't make the mistake of trying to fix what isn't broken, Obama said at a health care conference he hosted on March 5. So if somebody has insurance they like, they should be able to keep that insurance. If they have a doctor that they like, they should be able to keep their doctor. They should just pay less for the care that they receive. Would Obama's plan result in closer regulation of the health care system? Very likely so. It includes provisions that require health insurance companies to cover pre-existing conditions and disclose more information about how they treat patients. Obama's plan also calls for evidence-based health care standards, so that government can stop paying (through programs like Medicare) for treatments that don't get good results. But the plan is very different from some European-style health systems where the government owns health clinics and employs doctors. We asked Coburn's office about his remarks. What matters is not just President Obamas intent, or what his plan states, but the likely effect and consequences of his plan, said spokesman John Hart. Under Obamas approach, the only plans left standing will be those controlled by the government. That may be Sen. Coburn's opinion on what could happen, but it's definitely not part of Obama's plan. And Coburn was very specific in saying that under the Obama plan, all the health care in this country is eventually going to be run by the government. That gives the incorrect impression that Obama is promoting a government-run health care system. He's not.",0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,false

Final Rating: False  ","In eighth grade math, weve fallen to ninth place.","In his first major education speech, President Obama endorsed charter schools, merit pay for teachersand increases in school spending. He justified his agenda partly by saying American students are slipping compared to counterparts around the world. We've let our grades slip, our schools crumble, our teacher quality fall short, and other nations outpace us, Obama said in the March 10 speech to the United States Hispanic Chamber of Commerce. In eighth grade math, we've fallen to ninth place. Since Obama brought up math, we decided to check his. Turns out we had to pull out the red pen. We asked the White House to defend Obama's claim, and received no response. His claim that eighth grade math studentsin the United States are in ninth place internationally almost certainly comes from the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study, a periodic comparison of math and science achievement carried out since 1995 by research institutions and government agencies worldwide. Themost recent study, published in 2007, did indeed show U.S. eighth graders in ninth place behind five East Asian countries and Hungary, England and Russia. But it was misleading to say they had fallen to ninth place. In 1995, theycame in 28th. In 1999, theymoved up to 19th. In 2003, they climbedto 15th. So rather than falling, U.S. students have actuallyimprovedin the past decade. We considered giving the president partial credit since American students did come in ninth. But the point of his statement was that they had fallen to that position and that mathematics performance in the United States is getting worse relative to other countries. And that's just plain False.",0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,false

Final Rating: False",The Democrat-backed health care reform plan will require (Americans) to subsidize abortion with their hard-earned tax dollars.,"In an already contentious health care debate, the last thing the Obama administration wants is a fight over abortion. The word abortion was never mentioned in the initial health care plans released by the House and Senate. The decision of whether to offer abortion coverage in the proposed public plan, then, would be left up to the health and human services secretary. Abortion opponents said that would allow Democrats to slip abortion into the plan as part of the standard coverage. In an op-ed piece on July 23, House Republican Leader John Boehner of Ohio repeated the concerns of many who oppose abortion that the Democratic-backed health care reform plan will require (Americans) to subsidize abortion with their hard-earned tax dollars. Although there are several versions of the health care bill kicking around in Congress, one thing has now become clear: Most envision a government-run health plan option that could include abortion coverage, as well as a health care exchange in which participating private insurance companies would be permitted to offer such coverage. But does that mean that federal tax dollars would be used to subsidize abortions? That's a more difficult question. Let's back up a minute and explain some background: Currently, the 1976 Hyde Amendment prohibits the use of federal funds for abortions through Medicaid except in cases of rape, incest or when the mother's health is in peril. So states that want to offer abortion coverage have to pay for it themselves. Similar restrictions on public funding for abortions applies to federal health care coverage extended to active and retired military and federal employees. President Barack Obama gave a nod to that precedent when asked in a July 21 CBS interview with Katie Couric whether he favored a government option that would cover abortions. Obama said, As you know, I'm prochoice. But I think we also have a tradition of, in this town, historically, of not financing abortions as part of government-funded health care. Rather than wade into that issue at this point, I think that it's appropriate for us to figure out how to just deliver on the cost savings, and not get distracted by the abortion debate at this station. Abortion opponents had hoped similar restrictions to those in the Hyde Amendment would be placed on any government-run health care option, and also be extended to any private insurance companies that participate in the government-sponsored health care exchange, which will provide health insurance for people who don't get it through their employer. To that end, Rep. Bart Stupak, D-Mich., offered an amendment to the House health care proposal that would prohibit the use of public money to cover any part of the costs of any health plan that includes coverage of abortion. The amendment was narrowly defeated. Donna Crane, policy director for NARAL Pro-Choice America, called Stupak's proposal a radical departure from the status quo, because millions of women who currently have private insurance plans that cover abortions would be stripped of that coverage if their plan ultimately became part of the exchange — which seems likely. According to a 2002 Guttmacher Institute study, 87 percent of employment-based insured health plans offered coverage for abortions (though not all companies select it for their employees). A 2003 Kaiser Family Foundation survey found that 46 percent of covered workers had coverage for abortions. The two surveys asked different questions, but the bottom line is that a significant percentage of women currently have health insurance that covers abortions. And so began the debate over how to make the health care reform bill abortion neutral. A compromise plan offered by Rep. Lois Capps, D-Calif., which passed the House Energy and Commerce Committee, seeks to alleviate many of the concerns expressed by abortion opponents — particularly the issue of tax dollars being used to subsidize abortions — while specifically making abortion coverage available in both the public plan and in private plans participating in the exchange. Under the Capps amendment: • Abortion coverage would not be part of the required minimum benefits package. In other words, insurers would not be required to offer, or be prohibited from offering, abortion services in order to participate in the exchange. • The public plan could include abortion coverage, but the cost of the additional coverage could not be paid through public subsidies (tax dollars), only through the premiums paid by the insured. And with private plans in the exchange, again, federal subsidies could not be used for abortion coverage. • Public funding would only be permitted for abortions allowed under the Hyde Amendment — in cases of rape, incest or when the mother's life is in danger. • At least one plan in every region must offer full abortion coverage; and one must not. • Any insurance plan participating in the exchange cannot discriminate against hospitals or other health care facilities (such as Catholic hospitals) that are unwilling to provide abortions. • The plan will not pre-empt any state laws regarding abortion, such as parental notification laws. Douglas Johnson, legislative director for National Right to Life, said the amendment is hardly a compromise, and the pledge not to prohibit the use of public funds amounts to little more than symbolic bookkeeping. The Capps amendment may claim to segregate funds used for abortions, he said, but the bottom line is you have the government paying subsidies to people who are then able to obtain abortion coverage. And, he said, It's still the government running the whole plan. The government would be participating in the killing of unborn children under the guise of a health care plan, Johnson said. But that's not the opinion of all antiabortion groups. Chris Korzen, executive director of Catholics United, which opposes abortion, said his group doesn't want to see an important health care plan derailed by a misleading campaign that claims the health care plan would mean taxpayer-subsidized abortions. The goal should be to maintain the current policies, Korzen said. That Capps amendment accomplishes just that. It specifically prohibits taxpayers' funding of abortions. It disappoints me that there are people who are still making that claim. And, he said, there's a lot to be happy about, including the fact that abortion coverage was not included as part of the required minimum benefits package. Crane said NARAL believes abortion should be treated like any other health service. But they think the Capps amendment at least maintains the status quo, and that it helped to alleviate many of the concerns expressed by abortion opponents. We thought they got everything they wanted, Crane said. We are confused why they continue to push. Obviously, there's a lot at stake in the health care bill for both sides in the abortion debate. The fact that several versions of the health care reform bill are floating around Congress makes it difficult to say with certainty what the final plan will or will not include. But while it appears likely the plan would allow for the coverage of abortions, we don't see anything in the plans that would require taxpayers to foot the bill for that. In fact, in a key version of the bill — the one passed by the House Energy and Commerce Committee — members went to great pains to include an amendment to ensure that federal money is not used for abortion coverage. Again, things could change as the health reform package works its way through Congress, but for now, we don't see anything to support Boehner's claim that taxpayers would subsidize abortions. And so we rule his statement False.",0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,false

Final Rating: Half True  ","Says that in the last five years, Texas created more jobs than all other states combined.","The president of the conservative Texas Public Policy Foundation, Brooke Rollins, touts Texas economic strength in a TV ad that aired in April and May, saying that in the last five years, weve created more jobs than all other states combined. After a reader asked us to check Rollins claim, Joshua Trevino, a foundation spokesman, pointed us to information the foundation culled from the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics monthly employment data — specifically, figures from the Current Employment Statistics series, which is calculated using a broad survey of employer payroll data. First, the foundation identified those states where the number of jobs had grown between January 2006 and January 2011. There were only 10 states in that group. Texas ranked No. 1, with an increase of 545,900 jobs, from about 9.93 million to about 10.47 million. The other nine states, ranging in size from Louisiana to Wyoming, had a combined jobs increase of 183,700. However, that's not to say jobs werent lost in Texas during those years. Employment numbers fluctuate. At the states most recent peak, in August 2008, Texas had about 10.64 million jobs. About a year later, with the recession in full swing, Texas had about 400,000 less. Next, we asked the Texas Workforce Commission about the foundations claim. Lisa Givens, an agency spokeswoman, sent us a 50-state comparison of job growth also using monthly BLS figures. However, Givens accounting covered a more recent five-year period, March 2006 to March 2011 — numbers for which were still preliminary. Nine states, including Texas, had more jobs in March 2011 than in that month five years earlier. And Texas gains far outpaced the combined total for the other states: 539,500 vs. 134,400. So, the foundations figures stand up — in the way that such figures are often analyzed, including by PolitiFact. Unsaid is that this gauge defines job creation as a net increase in employment. That means the foundations analysis only takes into account the number of jobs created in excess of the number lost over a five-year period. But new jobs also sprung up in the other 40 states, although they were offset by greater losses. Is it fair to assess job creation without including them? Weve gone back and forth on that question. Rick Perry that Texas had created more than 850,000 jobs, more than all the other states combined. To come up with that number, Perrys campaign also looked at net job growth, although over a longer time period: January 2001 to June 2010. During our research of the Perry statement, Cheryl Abbot, a BLS economist in Dallas, told us that the governors statement was correct. We touched base with her again on the foundations TV statement, which she said has a legitimate basis.S. from November 2007-2008 were in Texas. We found that the Texas Workforce Commission, like the Texas Public Policy Foundation, had restricted its comparison to the states that experienced a net increase in employment; during the specified time period, there were 14 total, including Texas. While we researched that item, Michael Brandl, a senior lecturer at the University of Texas McCombs School of Business, told us that excluding all those states with net job losses — and disregarding any jobs gained in those states — exaggerates the Texas share of total new jobs in the U.S. To say it's misleading is to be kind, Brandi said. It's just not true. The Truth-O-Meter score so far: one ruling that favors net increases in employment as a valid gauge of job creation — and one that doesnt. Seeking more clarity, we turned to Jason Faberman, a senior economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia who has written an article on the BLS data sources. He agreed that it could be misleading to consider only net increases in jobs as job creation. But, he said, the public is accustomed to hearing it discussed that way. When most policy, political and media people refer to jobs created or added, they are referring to the net gain in employment over some period, Faberman said. Givens, at the workforce commission, told us that when the agency refers to net employment gains, it says jobs were added rather than created. What happens if you look at total jobs created, not just the net gain? Then Texas is no longer No. 1. The BLS keeps annual data, starting from April 1 each year, on total private sector job gains and losses. During the most recent three years — 2008, 2009 and 2010 — California gained an average of 1.3 million jobs annually, while Texas posted an average of 935,000 jobs. However, California also lost an average of 1.8 million jobs while Texas lost 992,000. However, Abbot cautioned that gross job numbers generally reflect a states population, meaning that big states would post bigger numbers than small ones. Theres no way that a Kansas could compare with a Texas, Abbot said. Faberman agreed that comparing gross job gains isnt the best way to fact-check the foundations statement. Instead, he suggested comparing Texas net employment change with that of the whole country, minus Texas share. What we found: In January 2011, the United States, excluding Texas, had 5.3 million fewer jobs than it did in January 2006 — the five-year period used by the foundation. That compares with the 545,900 increase that Texas experienced during that time. So, by Fabermans measure, Texas outperformed the rest of the country. We came across another way of thinking about job creation in an Aug. 24 blog on the Houston Chronicles website. According to the post, an unidentified economist noted that any raw job count would naturally favor Texas in a comparison with other net-gain states and asked what would happen if the size of the states job forces were factored in. The Chronicle did that by calculating the percentage increase in the states jobs between July 2009 and July 2010, and Texas still came out on top — but barely. Inspired by the Chronicle, we looked again at the 10 states with net job gains over the last five years. Texas gains represented a 5.5 percent increase in employment from January 2006 to January 2011. For the nine other states, their total increase of 183,700 jobs was a 2.5 percent increase. However, comparing the states individually, two had larger percentage increases than Texas: North Dakota (10.6 percent) and Alaska (5.7 percent). Another factor that changes — even reverses — the job creation numbers is the time frame. The longer the time frame, the better Texas numbers look. Comparing employment in a single month in 2006 with the same month five years later, Texas job numbers grow. Shorten the time period to three years, and Texas shows a net loss in jobs, going from 10.56 million jobs in January 2008 to 10.47 million in January 2011. So whats our (latest) ruling on job creation? The foundations claim that Texas created more jobs than all other states combined stands up — considering only those states that had net job gains over five years. Thats the methodology usually used to define job creation in public discourse. But the foundations analysis disregards the 40 states where millions of jobs were created but were outnumbered by losses. And looking at the percentage increase in jobs relative to the size of each states work force — another telling statistic — two other states experienced greater gains than Texas.",0.5,0.5,1.0,0.5,0.0,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,half-true

Final Rating: Half True  ",Says between 6 and 20 bicycles can be parked in the space required by one car.,"U.S. Rep. Earl Blumenauer has been associated with many causes during his 17 years in Congress. Bow ties come to mind, as does his support for protecting public lands. As founder and co-chair of the Congressional Bicycle Caucus, Blumenauer has been a leading voice in trying to establish the bicycle as a viable form of urban transportation. On the Bike and Pedestrian Issues page of his official website, he says that cycling improves health, is good for the environment and reduces transportation costs. One assertion in particular jumps out. It says, Between 6 and 20 bicycles can be parked in the space required by one car. PolitiFact Oregon wondered whether thats true. At first glance, the notion of up to 20 bicycles jammed into a single parking space seems a little much. To get an explanation, we called Blumenauers Washington, D.C., office and talked with spokesman Patrick Malone. Malone said the figure came from a paper published in 2011 by researcher Thomas Gotschi. Costs and Benefits of Bicycling Investments in Portland, Oregon was published in the Journal of Physical Activity & Health. A close reading does not reveal statistics addressing how many bicycles fit into a parking space. One section includes a sentence reading, The millions of miles traveled by bike reduce road and parking capacity demand, which is much more costly to provide for cars than for bikes. Its followed by a footnote, which took us to a second study, published this summer by the Victoria (B.C.) Transport Policy Institute. That 59-page study, written by Todd Litman, states, 10-20 bicycles can typically be stored in the space required for one automobile. Malone also referred to the bike corrals scattered around downtown Portland that hold 12 bicycles each, all in the amount of room needed to park a car. Then, noting two-tiered indoor bike parking available at Portland State University, he added, If you took the bike corrals we have now and put in double-decker parking with locks and lift assists, you could double that. Scott Cohen, the Portland Bureau of Transportations transportation demand management specialist, said Portland has 99 bike corrals. The portion that holds bicycles is 17 feet long and accommodates up to 12 bikes. A standard marked car-parking space is 20 feet long and about 10 feet wide. None of the corrals is the two-tier type mentioned by Malone. So 12 is the highest number of bicycle anyone will see in an area the size of a parking space. Two-tiered bike racks are available online but are primarily designed for commercial storage and retail bike storage and display. Several commercial racks hold as many as 20 bikes in 20 feet, but they need to be mounted to a wall or ceiling and arent really designed for outdoor use. Portland-based Alta Planning & Design, which has rolled out its Bicycle Share program in eight cities in the U.S. and abroad, says its racks fit about 10 bicycles in the length of a parking space. What if people simply stood their bikes next to one another or heaped them in a pile? Could 20 bikes fit inside a parking space then? Probably, but those options seem highly unlikely in the United States, and Malone didnt mention them. Twelve bicycles can be locked safely in downtown Portland bike corrals, but 20 stretches the limits of anything in use -- in Portland and nationwide. The Pedestrian and Bicycle Information Center says streetside bike corrals should accommodate 10 to 12 bikes. The Association of Pedestrian and Bicycle Professionals recommends spacing so that no more than 12 fit into a parking spot. As for the mechanical lifts available at PSU: Those wont be showing on city streets anytime soon. City policies allow only one-tier corrals, and businesses that already pay the city $2,600 to install one seem unlikely to want to pony up more. Blumenauers office does cite a study with a footnote leading to another study that says 10 to 20 bikes can fit into a single parking spot. The congressmans website also gives a range of 6 to 20 bikes, while 12 can commonly fit in corrals. So we find his statement Half True.",0.5,0.5,1.0,0.5,0.0,0.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,half-true

Final Rating: Half True  ","Says border fencing finished near El Paso in 2010 dramatically curtailed illegal crossings, local crime and drug smuggling.","Conservative Paul Sperry highlighted fencing erected near El Paso a decade ago as evidence that President Donald Trumps proposed border wall could enhance security. Sperry wrote in a January 2018 New York Post commentary that the fencing, described as completed in 2010, explains a dramatic decrease in violent crime in the West Texas city and plummets in illegal crossings and drug smuggling. We wondered about that after Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, promoted Sperrys commentary on Twitter and Bob Moore, former executive editor of the El Paso Times, asserted in his own tweet that El Paso had low violent crime rates as far back as 2005 while illegal border crossings, Moore wrote, decreased for varied reasons around 2010 including the Great Recession. Sperry, whom we emailed without hearing back, wrote that once the fencing went up, illegal crossings and levels of violent crime and drug smuggling rapidly subsided and that since then, El Paso has consistently topped rankings for cities of 500,000 residents or more with low crime rates, based on FBI-collected statistics. We'd suggest that claims about anycitys safety rankbe considered with caution. Such rankings are oft tied to FBI statistics that the agency counsels against using to rank or compare communities. Weve also done several separate fact-checks noting flaws in claims about El Pasos safety standing. On another front, it appears the fencing touted by Sperry was not finished in 2010. Ramiro Cordero, a spokesman for the Border Patrols El Paso sector, which takes in New Mexico, El Paso County and part of adjoining Hudspeth County, advised by email that from 2007 to approximately 2014, two types of fencing got built near the El Paso metro area: double-layered mesh 18 feet tall and mesh on movable barriers going up 22 feet. In 2009, David Aguilar of the Border Patrol specified at a U.S. Senate hearing that 626 miles of congressionally ordered fencing had been completed along the border. When fully built, Aguilar said, the additions would cover 661 miles from Texas into California, counting 115 miles each in New Mexico and Texas. Decreased illegal alien apprehensions We exploredeach part of Sperrys statement separately, starting with whether the new fencing greatly diminished border crossings. All along the southwestern border, its worth noting, apprehensions by the Border Patrol peaked in 2000 at 1.6 million (yearly total) and later generally declined starting around the time of the 2008-09 recession, Michelle Mittelstadt of the Migration Policy Institute, a nonpartisan think tank that studies worldwide immigration, has noted. Mittelstadt told PolitiFact in April 2017 that factors in Mexico had contributed to the drop-offs including lower birth rates, increased educational levels and an improved economy. In his commentary, Sperry wrote that according to Homeland Security data, the number of deportable illegal immigrants located by the U.S. Border Patrol plummeted by more than 89 percent over the five-year period during which the fencing between El Paso and neighboring Ciudad Juarez, Mexico, was completed. Sperry said that when the El Paso fencing project started in 2006, illegal crossings totaled 122,261, but by 2010, when the 131-mile fence was completed from one end of El Paso out into the New Mexico desert, immigrant crossings shrank to just 12,251. They hit a low of 9,678 in 2012, before slowly ticking back up to a total of 25,193 last year. But theyre still well below pre-fence levels, and the Border Patrol credits the fortified barrier dividing El Paso from Mexico for the reduction in illegal flows, Sperry wrote. We found that he accurately recapped government-posted tallies of illegal alien apprehensions, which are generally used as a metric to measure illegal immigration. An exception: When we checked, the Border Patrol was reporting a slightly greater number of apprehensions in 2006, 122,656 making the 9,678 apprehensions in the sector in 2012 92 percent less than apprehensions in 2006. Unaddressed by Sperry: All along the nations southern border, according to the Border Patrol, apprehensions decreased each year from 2007 through 2011. That is, the agencys pre-2017 low of 327,577 apprehensions in 2011 was down 69 percent from 1,071,972 apprehensions in 2006 and down 72 percent from 1,171,396 apprehensions in 2005. Border Patrol video singles out change in tactics Next, we reached out to the Border Patrol to ask about the fencing alone driving down apprehensions. We fielded no comment from Carlos A. Diaz, the agencys Southwest Border branch chief, though he pointed us by email to a 2017 Customs and Border Protection video describing enforcement actions from 1992 through 2016 to stem illegal crossings. The El Paso portion of the video doesnt mention fencing. Rather, it singles out the 285,000 apprehensions made in the El Paso sector in 1993--which a narrator says was the year that the Border Patrol implemented Operation Hold the Line at El Paso calling for the forward deployment of agents and technology to high-traffic areas. Focusing on prevention through deterrence, the narrator continues, the strategy proved successful and apprehensions decreased over 70 percent in the sector in one year and in 2015, 14,495 apprehensions were made in the El Paso sector. That snippet led us to revisit federal tallies of apprehensions, which show both a post-1986 high of 285,981 apprehensions in the sector in 1993 and a 72 percent plummet to 79,688 apprehensions in 1994 though apprehensions increased the next two years, reaching 145,929 in 1996. In subsequent years through September 2017, the sector reported decreased apprehensions in 13 years and increased apprehensions in eight years; its 25,193 apprehensions in 2017 amounted to the sectors third-most in a decade, possibly a reminder that economic conditions on both sides of the border, or unsafe conditions in parts of Central America, also can sway decisions to cross the Rio Grande. Other Border Patrol views When we asked, a couple of Border Patrol officers credited the El Paso fencing with enhancingenforcement. Doug Mosier, a Customs and Border Protection spokesman, said hes worked as an El Paso-based agency public affairs officer since 1986. By email, Mosier said Operation Hold The Line revolutionized the way that border security was conducted in terms of federal law enforcement prevention efforts. Mosier said Silvestre Reyes, later elected to the U.S. House, had tried a similar strategy on a smaller scale when he was a Border Patrol chief in McAllen, Texas, and it worked well for that community. According to a 2013 El Paso Times news story, the approach instigated by Reyes, described as still in place, called for the deployment of every available Border Patrol agent to different sites along 20 miles of the El Paso-Juarez border, roughly from Sunland Park, N.M., to the Zaragoza port of entry. Mosier elaborated to us: So, as the chief of El Paso Sector in 1993, he essentially positioned as many U.S. Border Patrol agents as he could spare (approximately 250 agents) along a primary 20-mile stretch of border separating El Paso/Juarez, over a three-week period. The result was astounding, since illegal apprehensions immediately dropped by approximately 80-percent overnight. Crime and loitering also fell by the wayside in the downtown district, which was later substantiated in several surveys and polls taken by the El Paso Times, and the then--El Paso Herald Post. At first the border community was in shock, but that soon gave way to widespread support which manifested in improved living conditions for residents in El Paso, and in some areas of N.M. The Times story said that after Hold the Line was implemented, Reyes went on to urge more strategic fencing. Mosier, asked to assess the effects of the fencing, said that when primary pedestrian fencing (18-feet) was implemented in 2008, it provided effective infrastructure in much-needed areas of the border. It also improved USBP effectiveness by better directing illegal immigration into areas where Border Patrol had more resources to monitor traffic via technology, aircraft, combined with increased agent personnel. We said at that time, and still say today, that those combined resources, our strong working relationship with law enforcement partners, and the support by residents in El Paso were essential to the success of El Paso border security efforts, Mosier said. Cordero, who also told us hes worked for the agency in the sector for 18 years, agreed the fencing helped reduce apprehensions but, he said, other enforcement activities and cooperation between law agencies and with Mexican authorities also mattered. Victor Manjarrez Jr. of the University of Texas at El Paso told us he was the sector chief when the fencing went up. By email, Manjarrez deemed the fencing a factor in driving down apprehensions along with increased Border Patrol personnel, expanded technology and infrastructure including lights and roads. Although the pedestrian wall had a huge impact, Manjarrez said, so did the increase in Border Patrol agents driven by a 2004 congressional directive to beef up the agency. I would disagree that the wall was the sole reason for the decline in criminal activity, but it was a MAJOR factor in improving the quality of life. El Paso crime Sperry wrote that FBI crime-rate information shows the fencing drove down crime in El Paso. In fact, Sperry wrote, El Paso before 2010 was mired in violent crime and drug smuggling, thanks in large part to illicit activities spilling over from the Mexican side. Once the fence went up, however, things changed almost overnight. His commentary also said: According to FBI tables, property crimes in El Paso have plunged more than 37 percent to 12,357 from their pre-fence peak of 19,702 a year, while violent crimes have dropped more than 6 percent to 2,682 from a peak of 2,861 a year. Moore countered in a post-publication tweet that El Pasos violent crime rate was on the slide long before the fencing got built. Our search of the Nexis news database showed too that the El Paso County sheriff, Richard Wiles, told a U.S. Senate committee in 2009 that by that year, El Paso had been considered one of the countrys safest cities for a dozen years, long before the new fence was built, Wiles testified. Moore, answering our request for more information, emailed us his spreadsheet suggesting that each year from 2000 through 2016, El Pasos violent crime rate based on FBI data far trailed the average violent crime rate for like cities of 500,000 to 1 million residents. The FBIs posted figures enabled us to confirm that El Pasos violent crime rate trailed the national average for cities of 500,000 to 1 million residents from 1985 through 2016. The citys rate also mostly decreased year to year, the figures indicate, though the city still saw 11 year-to-year increases with the biggest rate bump, 10 percent, occurring in 2008. Conversely, El Pasos rate sank 10 percent or more 10 times in the 30 years including 1994, 1995, 1998, 2000, 2002, 2003, 2005 and 2006--all before the new fencing was mandated or fully installed--with the other big drops occurring in 1987 and 2013. Drug smuggling Sperry wrote that drug smuggling at the El Paso border entry point has also fallen dramatically. In fact, since the fence was completed, the volume of marijuana and cocaine coming through El Paso and seized by Border Patrol agents has been cut in half. The year before the wall was fully built in 2010, Sperry went on, the volume of illegal drugs confiscated by the feds along the El Paso border hit 87,725 pounds. The year after, the amount of drug seizures plummeted to 43,783 pounds. Last year, they dropped even further to a total of 34,329, according to Border Patrol reports obtained by The Post. We found slightly different figures. Regardless, a chart provided by Cordero showed that the dollar amount of illegal drug seizures in the El Paso sector substantially declined from 2007 through 2014, when the agencys $35.2 million in seizures was more than 400 percent less than the nearly $151 million in seizures in 2006. While seizures escalated in 2015 and 2016, reaching $54 million, they declined to $39 million in 2017, the agencys chart says. Drug Seizures, El Paso Sector, U.S. Border Patrol, Fiscal 2006 though Fiscal 2017         SOURCE: Email, Ramiro Cordero, agent, U.S, Border Patrol, El Paso sector, Jan. 18, 2018 We later ran these mostly reduced interdictions of illegal drugs past Sanho Tree, director of the Drug Policy Project at the Institute for Policy Studies, which calls itself Washingtons first progressive multi-issue think tank. Tree said by phone he wasnt aware of research on the effect of the El Paso fencing on drug smuggling. Yet generally, Tree said, declines in captured drugs dont necessarily signal fall-offs in smuggling, which relies on frequent shifts in methodology extending to drones, tunnels, even catapults. What you interdict shows you what youre catching, it doesnt show what youre not catching, Tree said, adding that its hard to model the effects on smuggling of particular law enforcement tacks. Local police agencies didnt engage withthis fact-check. Sgt. Enrique Carrillo of the El Paso Police Department replied by email: We are not commenting on this. Our requests to interview Sheriff Wiles went unfulfilled. Our ruling Sperry wrote that the fencing finished near El Paso in 2010 dramatically curtailed illegal crossings, local crime and drug smuggling. Such crossings evidently plunged after the fencing was built (though they later rebounded a bit) and it could be that drug smuggling fell off as well. Yet this claim fails to account for El Paso's violent crime rate trending down long before the fencing went up nor does it acknowledge other factors affecting security including apre-1995 shift in enforcement strategy and stepped-up Border Patrol staffing.

Final Rating: Half True  ",Says Rick Scott cut Medicaid so people can't get Obamacare.,"It starts like a joke — Gov. Rick Scott walks into a Gainesville Starbucks — but one patron wasnt laughing. In town on April 5, 2016, to tour the recently opened factory and headquarters for biopharmaceutical company Nanotherapeutics, Scott stopped in to the coffee chain for a cup. Cara Jennings, a former Lake Worth city commissioner, saw Scott and ripped into him from her seat. Among other grievances, she accused him of denying her health care coverage with his policies. In fact, you cut Medicaid so I couldnt get Obamacare, Jennings shouted on April 5, 2016. You are an a------! You dont care about working people. You dont care about working people. You should be ashamed to show your face around here. When Scott countered that the state had created a million jobs since the recession, she said no one cared (read our fact-check on those jobs numbers). She then criticized his March signing of a bill denying funding for womens health care clinics that performed abortions (read our check about that issue). We tried to reach Jennings by phone, text, email and even Facebook, but we didnt hear back from her, so we dont really know the specifics of her situation. That makes it difficult to gauge whether she was able to benefit from the health care law. But we can look at whether Scott cut Medicaid, the joint state and federal program to provide health insurance for the very poor, in a way that could have denied people health coverage under the Affordable Care Act. Its not so much that he cut anything, but more that he hasnt consistently supported expanding the program. That has indeed left hundreds of thousands of Floridians without coverage. The expansion debate  Jennings told ABC Action News in Tampa after the incident that she is a single mother who worked part-time. That provides clues that she may fall into what is known as the Medicaid coverage gap. To understand why, lets review how the Affordable Care Act is linked to Medicaid. The law originally wanted to cover uninsured people two different ways. One was to subsidize people who needed help buying insurance through state marketplaces or HealthCare.gov. The second was to expand Medicaid to cover a higher number of poorer people. Normally, to be eligible for Medicaid, your annual income has to be 44 percent of the federal poverty level (100 percent is currently $11,880 for an individual and $24,300 for a family of four). The plan was to extend that eligibility to all adults up to 138 percent of the poverty level. Technically the calculation under the law is 133 percent, but a 5 percent deduction is added on top of that. But Medicaid expansion ended up being optional after a 2012 Supreme Court ruling saying it could not be forced upon states. Currently 19 states, including Florida, have chosen not to grow the program. Recent estimates from the Kaiser Family Foundation showed that 948,000 uninsured adults in Florida would be covered by an expansion. This has led to plenty of debate among lawmakers, including a meltdown during the 2015 Florida legislative session over how to cover more lower-income residents. The Senate was open to a limited expansion, while the House opposed it altogether. But now the math really starts to get tricky. If a state doesnt expand Medicaid, people who make 100 to 400 percent of the poverty level can get marketplace subsidies to buy private insurance. Because of the way the law was written, that leaves people making between 44 and 100 percent of the poverty level out in the cold, without assistance. Those people dont qualify for Medicaid, and cant get subsidies to buy insurance. Thats the so-called coverage gap. According to Kaiser, there are 567,000 people under that umbrella in the Sunshine State. Chances are good that a single mother working part time could fit into that definition. Scott, a former hospital chain executive best known for resigning amid controversy over his company defrauding Medicare, has had a spotty history with Medicaid. He initially opposed expanding the program under Obamacare, then supported it during his re-election campaign, then went back to opposing it. While the Legislature is the body that would have to approve an expansion, Scotts opinion affects the debate. (Scotts office did not respond to our questions about Medicaid.) He has argued with Washington over the federal government ending payments for low-income hospital patients, leaving the Legislature to use state money to plug holes in the program the last two years. Scott has also asked lawmakers to eliminate automatic increases to Medicaid hospital rates. Hes also overseen the states controversial transition to managed care, in which private companies took over Medicaid policies as a cost-cutting measure. Florida CHAIN, a consumer health advocacy group, told us managed care organizations had actually seen a boost in funding. And theres the aforementioned abortion bill Scott signed on March 25. That bill prevents state and Medicaid money from going to clinics that perform elective abortions, including Planned Parenthood affiliates. But these are specific issues not necessarily related to getting access to broad health care coverage under Obamacare. While many Floridians remain uninsured without Medicaid expansion, we found no evidence of an outright cut, as Jennings said. Our ruling The activist at Starbucks said Rick Scott cut Medicaid so people can't get Obamacare. Her point-blank accusation that Scott cut the program doesnt fit. But through Scotts inaction and the Florida House's resistance to expansion,many Floridians are not benefitting from either subsidies to buy private insurance or an expanded Medicaid.

Final Rating: Half True  ","When I was governor, not only did test scores improve – we also narrowed the achievement gap.","Mitt Romney heard both cheers and boos during his speech to the 2012 NAACP convention, where he vowed to help hundreds of millions of middle-class Americans of all races.While acknowledging the unlikelihood of a Republican addressing the group in the midst of a race against an African-American president, Romney nonetheless declared that he is the best candidate to help black Americans.The former Massachusetts governor touted his own record on several topics, including education. He said he intervened in failing schools, promoted math and science and strengthened testing standards.When I was governor, not only did test scores improve – we also narrowed the achievement gap, Romney, who served from 2003 to 2007, said.Romneys education record in Massachusetts is uncharted territory at PolitiFact, so we decided to check it out.A little on Massachusetts schoolsWe talked to several people knowledgeable about the school system in the Bay State, and all mentioned a 1993 landmark reform law that included the groundwork for the state accountability system (later called Massachusetts Comprehensive Assessment System, or MCAS), authorized charter schools and invested more money in local school districts. Its universal goal was to raise educational standards for all Massachusetts kids.Romney also referenced the reform in his speech to the NAACP on July 11, 2012:In the years before I took office our states leaders had come together to pass bipartisan measures that were making a difference. In reading and in math, our students were already among the best in the nation – and during my term, they took over the top spot. Those results revealed what good teachers can do if the system will only let them. The problem was, this success wasnt shared. A significant achievement gap between students of different races remained. So we set out to close it.This was all happening in a place where student achievement regularly leads the pack. Massachusetts, which has a disproportionately high number of colleges and universities, some of the nations wealthiest ZIP codes and a well-educated workforce, churns out many high performing students.But the glare of those top achievers makes the shadow of struggling students that much darker. That is to say, Massachusetts still has a significant achievement gap. The term refers to the disparity in performance between certain subsets of students. White, middle- and upper-class kids consistently do better in school than African-American and latino and low-income kids in the U.S.And in Massachusetts, because the kids at the top do so well, its that much harder for everybody else to catch up.Our scores are high, so as they get higher its pretty hard to move up, said Kathleen Skinner, a policy director at the Massachusetts Teachers Association, a teachers union.Narrowing the gapAs backup for the claim in Romneys speech, his campaign sent us a 2007 MCAS test results summary, and specifically pointed to 10th grade scores:10th Grade Proficiency In Matho 2005, White: 29%; Black: 19%. Gap = 10 pointso 2007, White: 29%; Black: 26%. Gap = 3 points10th Grade Proficiency In Englisho 2005, White: 46%; Black: 30%. Gap = 16 pointso 2007, White: 52%; Black: 40%. Gap = 12 pointsThat shows the achievement gap narrowing by 7 percentage points in math and by 4 percentage points in English.But the gains in other grades are smaller.Among eighth-graders, the gap tightened by only 1 point in math and 2 points in English. For seventh-graders, the change was 3 points in math, 5 points in English. Sixth grade: 1 point in math, no change in English. In fourth grade scores, the gap narrowed by 1 point in math and widened by 1 point in English. (Some of those are comparisons between 2006 scores and 2007, the only years provided in the test results summary.)Skinner pointed out an important point about the MCAS: 10th-graders have to pass it in order to graduate.They start paying attention, she said. We also took a look at scores for the following year, comparing the achievement gap between 2007 and 2008. (These charts offer a slightly different comparison from the previous year, which looked at students who scored proficient on each test. The 2007-08 chart includes those scoring proficient and higher.) The best gains again were made by 10th graders who narrowed the gap by six points in English. But there was no change in the gap in math scores, and lower grades showed only one- or two-point gains, or no improvement at all, and the gap widened in a couple of instances, such as eighth-grade science scores. The 2008-2009 test score summary reflected a similar trend: small gains in some subjects and small setbacks in others.Beverly Miyares, also with the Massachusetts Teachers Association, added that the dropout rate among black students in Massachusetts increased from 2002 to 2004, rising from 4.9 to 6.3.That means more under-performing students who dropped out of school didnt drag down the overall average test scores.Romneys roleIn claims such as this, we dont just consider the accuracy but also whether the speaker deserves credit: How responsible was Romney for narrowing the achievement gap?The most important point to make with Gov. Romneys record is that the reform he initiated was part of a much larger and longer movement that existed in Massachusetts, said Chad d'Entremont, executive director of the Rennie Center, which provides independent, nonpartisan research to inform public education reform in Massachusetts.Glenn Koocher, executive director with the Massachusetts Association of School Committees, which represents school boards, was less generous: He had nothing to do with it. Its the teachers in the classrooms who are making the difference.Skinner, the expert with the teachers union, added that Romney was a somewhat absent education governor. He was very agenda driven.We would argue that he didnt put anything in place to narrow the gap, she said.We also wondered whether Romney had pushed any initiatives specifically aimed at helping minority students. Koocher and Skinner both mentioned charter schools, which are favored by many Republicans.The charter school program was always popular among minority parents (and) any parents that wanted to get their kids out of the public schools, Koocher said, adding that vouchers commonly used to pay tuition at charter schools are unconstitutional in Massachusetts. Instead, the per-pupil state spending is deducted from the public school districts budget.Ryan Williams, spokesman for the Romney campaign, said protecting the 1993 reform legislation was an important effort by Romney. He said there were attempts to repeal the graduation requirement, and Romney stood firm on that and did not back down.It was one of the bigger things we had success in blocking, Williams said. A lot of what Romney did when he was governor was to preserve that legislation. He said, Im not going to roll these standards back. Skinner mentioned another, perhaps less obvious, initiative from Romney that helped many minority students: universal health care. Romney signed a health care reform law in Massachusetts that led to a 98 percent coverage rate.In Massachusetts, all of our kids have health insurance, and I dont think anybody should underestimate the impact that has on learning. Our kids get vaccinated, they can go to the dentist, they can go to the eye doctor, she said. Their health is less of an issue than it is in other places.Our rulingRomney told the NAACP that when he was governor of Massachusetts, not only did test scores improve – we also narrowed the achievement gap.State education figures over two years support Romneys claim about learning gains, although its worth noting that some areas declined on his watch, such as the drop-out rate. And its always somewhat dubious to take a snapshot of statistics from only one or two years, when, as d'Entremont said significant gains in student achievement dont happen overnight, and the gains in Massachusetts are the result of a 20-year reform effort.Whats more, Romney, a single-term governor, should not get all the credit for improvement in the achievement gap, which is influenced by myriad factors.His statement is partially accurate but omits a lot of important information and overstates his impact.",0.5,0.5,1.0,0.5,0.0,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,half-true

Final Rating: Half True  ",You have areas of Pennsylvania that are barely affected and [the governor wants] to keep them closed.,"After touring an Allentown warehouse filled with protective medical equipment, President Donald Trump criticized Gov. Tom Wolf for keeping parts of Pennsylvania closed that the president thinks are no longer threatened by the coronavirus. You have areas of Pennsylvania that are barely affected and [the governor wants] to keep them closed, Trump told a crowd of workers from Owens & Minor, a company that manufactures and distributes masks, gloves and gowns to health care workers, on May 14. We wondered whether the statewide stay-at-home order Wolf issued on April 1 still applies to places hardly impacted by the deadly disease. It all depends what criteria are used to determine whether the coronavirus still poses a threat. The virus is still raging across Southeastern Pennsylvania, and not even Trump is arguing that Philadelphia and its suburbs are ready to reopen. Officials in Delaware and Bucks counties, however, have asked Wolf to exclude their nursing-home populations when he eventually rates their readiness. Largely when you look across the state, the hardest hit area has been the Southeast of Pennsylvania, said Dr. David Rubin, director of PolicyLab at Childrens Hospital of Philadelphia, which has been tracking the differences in the outbreak across individual regions of the country. The Philadelphia area as far west as Lancaster, Berks and Dauphin counties, and north to the Lehigh Valley have seen some of the worst outbreaks in Pennsylvania, he said. Largely the rest of the state has had a pretty deceptively, sort of minimal experience with COVID, Rubin said. That includes Allegheny County, the rural T and the South, Central and Southwestern parts of the state. When you have someone in that area of the state that are upset that they are unable to work, theyre not wrong, Rubin said. But for those in the Southeast worried about a resurgence, theyre not wrong, either. Wolf has already moved 37 Pennsylvania counties into what he calls the yellow phase of reopening. In these places, many businesses may resume in-person operations, and residents may leave their homes so long as they take precautions. Thirteen counties in Southwestern Pennsylvania moved into the yellow phase May 15. Twenty-four others in the Northern half of the state entered yellow May 8. Another 12 counties will move into yellow on May 22. Counties in the red phase of Wolfs reopening plan are still under lockdown, with stay-at-home orders in place and all but essential businesses closed. Counties that eventually make it to the green phase will ask businesses and individuals to follow Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and State Department of Health guidelines for limiting the spread of the virus but will otherwise have no restrictions. Yellow counties gyms, hair salons, and schools must remain closed, and gatherings of more than 25 people are prohibited. Even still, yellow is the distinction several other Central and Eastern Pennsylvania counties are clamoring for. A key factor that determines whether a county qualifies for yellow privileges is whether it has fewer than 50 new reported coronavirus cases per 100,000 residents over a period of 14 days. The number of people sickened with the virus in Lancaster, Lebanon, Dauphin, Franklin and Schuylkill counties disqualifies them from entering the yellow phase. But that fact didnt stop local leaders from announcing plans to reopen businesses anyway – with or without Wolfs blessing. In a series of letters and tweets, the officials, including state lawmakers and county commissioners, begged Wolf to allow local businesses to reopen and better position themselves to survive the crisis. Officials from Dauphin, Franklin and Schuylkill counties later backed down. Lebanon officials are set to vote on reopening today. Lancaster officials held a news conference on the issue Thursday night but did not say what they will do. Counties reversed course after Wolf called them cowardly and selfish and threatened to withhold their federal stimulus funds if they directed businesses and residents to defy his order. Until recently, another nine counties found themselves in limbo. They had reported fewer than 50 cases per 100,000 residents over a 14-day period, but until May 15, when Wolf announced plans to move them into the yellow phase soon, they remained stuck in the red zone, which requires businesses to stay closed and residents to continue sheltering at home. Those counties include: York, Adams, Perry, Juniata, Mifflin, Carbon, Wyoming, Susquehanna and Wayne. Officials from York and Adams counties had been especially vocal about their frustration that businesses had not been cleared to reopen. Some officials said they didnt understand what was holding them back, given their success keeping coronavirus case counts relatively low. Wolf had been asked about the discrepancy several times in recent days before he announced plans to move the counties into yellow by May 22, and his explanations lacked clarity. We had to read a 7,000 word Wolf administration document titled Process to Reopen Pennsylvania to figure it out. A countys coronavirus case count is not the only piece of information Wolfs team uses to determine when its ready to move into the yellow phase. Hes said this publicly, but on recent calls with the press, he hasnt listed the other factors that matter. Carnegie Mellon University researchers advising the state compiled the list and rated counties in each category. According to the document, the other factors are: A countys ability to meet a surge in demand for intensive care. A countys density. The share of county residents who are over age 60. The share of county residents who work in physically closed industry sectors, such as nursing homes. When those pieces are considered, it appears York County was held back from reopening because of its population density, and Adams County was ordered to stay closed because it has an insufficient number of intensive care unit beds. Mifflin, Juniata, Perry, Carbon, Susquehanna and Wayne counties were also flagged because of limited ICU capacity. We had to click through a link tucked at the bottom of a May 8 press release to find a May 7 PowerPoint presentation detailing how each Pennsylvania county rates on the Carnegie Mellon risk assessment scale. Its unclear if county officials calling to have their stay-at-home orders lifted know where to find their own ratings. Wyoming County in the Northeast corner of the state has a small number of coronavirus cases and doesnt rate as high risk in any of the other categories. Before Wolf announced that Wyoming County would move into the yellow phase by May 22, it was unclear why Wolf wouldnt allow businesses there to reopen. County officials had announced plans to reopen without Wolfs approval and later backed down. In the Process to Reopen Pennsylvania document, the state cautioned that the reopening process will be fluid and that the Carnegie Mellon rating system is not designed to make decisions but rather to inform decision makers. Trump said that Wolf wants to keep parts of Pennsylvania closed that have been barely affected by the coronavirus. Trump was likely speaking about counties in Central and Eastern Pennsylvania like Lebanon and Lancaster whose Republican lawmakers have been clamoring for more freedom even though their coronavirus case counts remain relatively high. Those places have not been barely affected. Theyre battling active outbreaks. Trump was right, though, that until May 15, Wolf wanted to keep closed nine counties with relatively few cases.",0.5,0.5,1.0,0.5,0.0,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,half-true

Final Rating: Half True  ",Says 92 percent of the people agree on DACA.,"President Donald Trump has questioned why undocumented immigrants who came to the United States as children should be deported, a sharp departure from the campaign when he advocated for the removal of all who were violating immigration laws. Trumps administration is phasing out Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA), an Obama-era program that shields young undocumented immigrants from deportation. At the same time, Trump wants Congress to pass a permanent solution for the so-called Dreamers, saying the idea has very high support among Americans. (DACA recipients are commonly called Dreamers.) Look, 92 percent of the people agree on DACA, but what we want is we want very, very powerful border security, Trump said Sept. 14 before traveling from Washington to meet with Floridians affected by Hurricane Irma. He said Republican congressional leaders were also on board. Later in Florida, he said they were not looking at amnesty or citizenship, but looking at allowing people to stay here. If and when funding for Trumps border wall will come or what will be part of a DACA deal is still unclear. For now, we were curious about Trumps claim that 92 percent of people agree on a solution for DACA recipients. We did not find a poll showing support that high, but several polls do show that the majority of Americans want a favorable outcome for Dreamers. The White House declined to comment for this fact-check. We found several polls that asked about DACA and showed majority support for not deporting Dreamers. But we did not find nearly universal support that Trump described. • A Morning Consult and Politico poll conducted between Sept. 7-11, after the Trump administration announced it was eliminating DACA, found that of 1,976 registered voters polled, 45 percent said it was the wrong thing to do; 35 percent said it was the right thing to do; 20 percent did not know or had no opinion. Asked about the issue in a different way — When it comes to legislation regarding Dreamers, which of the following would you most like Congress to pass? — 54 percent of respondents said they would want legislation that allowed Dreamers to stay and become citizens if they met certain requirements; 19 percent favored legislation that would allow them to stay legally but not become citizens, if they met certain requirements; 12 percent wanted legislation that removes or deports them; and 15 percent did not know or had no opinion. So, for this second question, 73 percent favored legislation that would protect Dreamers from deportation. A previous Morning Consult and Politico poll, conducted from April 20-24 asked about 2,000 registered voters what they thought was the best way to handle Dreamers. Fifty-six percent said they should be allowed to stay and become citizens if they met certain requirements, and 22 percent favored allowing them to stay and become legal residents, but not citizens, if they met certain requirements. Overall, 78 percent definitely did not want Dreamers to be deported. • An NBC News and SurveyMonkey poll, conducted online from August 24-29 among a national sample of 10,129 adults, found 64 percent support for DACA. • A Sept. 3-5 poll from The Economist and YouGov of 1,500 U.S. adults also found that 55 percent of responders somewhat or strongly supported DACA, though support for the program was lower among Trump voters and Republicans. Several polling and public opinion experts we reached out to say they were not aware of any recent poll showing a 92 percent support for DACA, but that a solid majority does seem to favor the program. Trump said92 percent of the people agree on DACA. We found several polls in which a majority of people said they supported DACA or favored legislation that would allow Dreamers to stay in the United States. But the level of support was not as high as 92 percent.",0.5,0.5,1.0,0.5,0.0,0.2,0.4,1.0,0.6,half-true

Final Rating: Half True  ",Wisconsin children are crossing condemned bridges in the middle of the winter to get to the school bus.,"Saying Wisconsins transportation needs are urgent, state Sen. Kathleen Vinehout, a potential candidate for governor in 2018, made an alarming claim. We have bridges in my own county that have been condemned, the Alma Democrat said Feb. 24, 2017 on Wisconsin Public Television. And we still have school children that are crossing those condemned bridges in the middle of the winter to get to the school bus. An unsettling image for rural Buffalo County, which is three hours northwest of Madison. We found there are two bridges in the county so badly damaged that they are closed to vehicle traffic, though only one of them is traversed by children to get to and from their school bus. And the word condemned, while accurate in a colloquial sense, exaggerates the danger to kids. Bridge worries The need for improvements on Wisconsins bridges has gained attention in the past couple of years, even if the terms used to describe their condition might mean less than they seem. Structurally deficient means suffering from deterioration to at least one major component, but not unsafe. Functionally obsolete means built using outdated standards, such as older design features. Wisconsins figure has risen to 15 percent, according to a 2017 report by the American Road & Transportation Builders Association, with 1,232 bridges deficient and 783 obsolete. How to pay for bridge work has been a persistent issue. A January 2017 audit by the nonpartisan state Legislative Audit Bureau noted that in a 2015 survey done by the bureau, only 50 percent of county highway commissioners said money for routine maintenance on bridges was adequate. Meanwhile, Republican Gov. Scott Walker and the GOP-majority Legislature, as they work on Walkers state budget proposal for 2017-19, are debating about new taxes or other ways of funding road and bridge work. Buffalo County To check Vinehouts claim, we called Buffalo County Highway Commissioner Bob Platteter. He said flooding caused by an August 2016 storm damaged the 125-foot Schoepps Valley Bridge, which spans Waumandee Creek, beyond repair. Its scrap, he said. The bridge was closed to vehicle traffic, so in that sense it could be considered condemned, Platteter told us -- but it was judged safe for pedestrian crossing, which continued until demolition began nearly seven months later, in March 2017. Nearby residents would drive their children to the bridge and the kids walked over it to catch the school bus, he said. And to avoid a detour of up to 20 miles, some residents with multiple vehicles parked one on the road on one side of the bridge and one on the other side. Platteter said a new timber bridge is expected to be installed by the end of April 2017. The Highway U bridge in Buffalo County partially collapsed one evening in February 2017, causing accidents two accidents that injured both drivers, though neither needed treatment.The collapse likely was also because of flood damage, Platterer said. That bridge is also now open only to pedestrians. But school buses use other county roads to pick up and drop off children in that area, he said. Our rating Vinehout says Wisconsin children are crossing condemned bridges in the middle of the winter to get to the school bus. Two bridges in Vinehouts home county of Buffalo have been condemned in that they are too badly damaged for any vehicle traffic. But officials have determined that they remain safe for pedestrians, and children do use one of the bridges to get to and from their school bus.

Final Rating: Half True  ","In Texas, we've had three ISIS-related incidents already.","After the recent terrorist attacks in France, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott was among governors declaring they would not accept Syrian refugees because of a potential for terrorism. Abbott appeared on The Real Story, a Fox News program, on Nov.17, 2015, to explain his stance on keeping refugees out of Texas because of security concerns. We've had three ISIS-related incidents already and now with the possible connection of one of the Syrian refugees being involved in the terrorist attack in Paris, Abbott said, Texas is saying 'no more.  We wondered whether Texas was really the site of so many ISIS plots. Abbott spokesman John Wittman pointed us to a letter from Abbott to Obama dated Nov. 16, 2015, which said: The threat posed to Texas by ISIS is very real. ISIS claimed credit last May when two terrorist gunmen launched an attack in Garland, Texas. Less than two weeks later, the FBI arrested an Iraqi-born man in North Texas and charged him with lying to federal agents about traveling to Syria to fight with ISIS. The letter went on to say that in 2014, when I served as Texas attorney general, we participated in a Joint Terrorism Task Force that arrested two Austin residents for providing material support to terrorists -- including ISIS. To determine if Abbott got his facts straight, we looked at each of the incidents. An Austin-area arrest and conviction Some of this was old ground for us. In September 2014, when Abbott was the state attorney general also running for governor, he claimed hed been involved in prosecuting a terrorist member of ISIS. We found that claim False; Abbott offered no evidence to back up his declaration aside from a press release crediting a range of agencies including the attorney general as well as the Killeen Police Department and Texas Alcoholic Beverage Commission. Abbotts statement also relied on a broad definition of terrorist and ISIS member. A federal complaint indicated Michael Todd Wolfe of Austin may have sought to be those things. But the complaint didnt confirm hed become a terrorist or ISIS member. In the case in question, Wolfe and Rahatul Khan of Round Rock, Texas, were charged with attempting to provide material support to terrorists. Wolfe had tried to board an international flight out of George Bush Intercontinental Airport that would take him to the first stop on a planned journey to Syria. In June 2015, Wolfe was sentenced to seven years in prison for attempting to provide material support to terrorists. According to the criminal complaint, Khan attempted to recruit an undercover FBI agent to a terrorist cell over the Internet. He was sentenced to 10 years imprisonment. The pipeline was affiliated with al-Shabaab — the al-Qaeda-linked Somali militant group behind the mass slaying of Christian students at a Kenyan university earlier this year—not ISIS. Abbotts second described incident In his 2015 letter to Obama, Abbott also referenced concerns about Bilal Abood, the Iraqi-born man in North Texas. Court documents show Abood migrated to the United States in 2009, and offer the following account of his subsequent movement and activities: On March 29, 2013, FBI agents prevented Abood from boarding a flight at Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport. He told them he was planning to visit family. Interviewed a second time five days later, Abood said his intent was to join the Free Syrian Army (FSA) in the struggle against Bashar al-Assad, the president of Syria. Later in April 2013, Abood travelled to Turkey via Mexico, on or about April 29. Agents again interviewed Abood upon his return to the United States on Sept. 16, 2013. He admitted he had travelled to Syria and stayed in an FSA camp, but denied financially supporting any terrorist group. A search of Aboods computer in July 2014 found that he had tweeted a pledge of allegiance to Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the leader of ISIS, on June 19, 2014. He later denied pledging allegiance to ISIS and was arrested for making a materially false, fictitious and fraudulent statement and representation, in a matter within the jurisdiction of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Abbotts letter mischaracterizes the nature of Aboods offense; he wrote that Abood was charged with lying to federal agents about traveling to Syria to fight with ISIS, not lying about a tweet. Shootings in Garland The third incident referenced by Abbott was the Garland, Texas, shooting scheme attempted by Elton Simpson and Nadir Soofi on May 5, 2015. According to a criminal complaint the FBI later filed against a Florida man who claimed to have encouraged the attack, the two planned to shoot attendees at a contest centered around cartoons of the prophet Muhammad (drawing the prophet Muhammad is forbidden in Islam). However, they were shot and killed outside the event by police. This incident is the only foiled attack included in a Department Homeland Security analysis of all ISIS-related arrests on United States soil from January 2014 to September 2015 (the other cases were unsuccessful and successful attempts to travel to fight with ISIS, provide material support to ISIS, and engage in early stage aspirational attack planning). In the aftermath of the shooting, ISIS claimed credit. However, by the time Abbott made his claim, investigators had yet to issue any statement characterizing the Garland attack as having been ordered by members of ISIS. Simpson was involved in terrorist causes before ISIS even split off from Al-Qaeda. He was arrested by the FBI in 2010 after discussing jihad and potential travel to Somalia with an informant the previous year. Allison Mahan, an FBI spokeswoman in Dallas, told us via email, The Garland attackers were ISIS-inspired and the investigation is ongoing. ISIS-inspired terrorist attacks are much more common than attacks directly ordered by members of the group, according to an analysis published in the October 2015 issue of the Terrorism Research Initiatives Perspectives on Terrorism. The TRI is an international consortium of scholars founded in 2007 to facilitate security studies research. Our ruling In his opposition to resettlement of Syrian refugees in Texas, Gov. Greg Abbott said he was concerned about potential terrorism from devotees to the Islamic State. In Texas, Abbott said, we've had three ISIS-related incidents already. Abbottis on solid ground with one Islamic State-related incident — the Garland shooting plot. In other Texas arrests related tothe group, he uses the term incident to cover things including lying about a tweet and trying to travel to Syria.

Final Rating: Half True  ","U.S. Sen. Johnny Isakson has never proposed, nor voted in favor of, a substantial cut in federal spending and has voted for many substantial increases in federal spending.","Note to readers: a letter to the editor responding to this item appeared Oct. 11, 2010. The letter appears at the end of the article. Chuck Donovan gave us a challenge.The Libertarian nominee for Georgia's U.S. Senate seat asked AJC PolitiFact Georgia to check out some claims on his campaign website about the incumbent, Sen. Johnny Isakson, R-Ga. Voters will decide among Isakson, Donovan and Democrat Michael Thurmond on Nov. 2.We looked at Donovan's blog, which included a post called Isakson's Inconsistencies. The post challenged the Republican on a host of issues, but one line questioning Isakson's conservative credentials on federal spending stood out.Mr. Isakson has never proposed, nor voted in favor of, a substantial cut in federal spending, Donovan began. However, he has voted in favor of: (a) many substantial increases in federal spending; and (b) tremendous annual deficits.Challenge accepted.Isakson spokeswoman Sheridan Watson showed us a page on the senator's website full of news releases and statements highlighting votes and bills he supported to curb spending. It also noted Isakson has twice won the Taxpayers' Friend Award from the National Taxpayers Union for his efforts to curb federal spending.Happy investigating, Watson wrote us.Donovan's post was researched and written by fellow Libertarian Allen Buckley, an Atlanta-based attorney and certified public accountant who won 2 percent of the vote in an unsuccessful campaign against Isakson in 2004.Let's look at the first part of Donovan's claim: Isakson has never proposed or voted for a substantial cut in federal spending.The senator's website offers four main arguments to dispute Donovan. Isakson has voted often to cap discretionary spending, programs that are not entitlements such as Medicare and Social Security. Discretionary spending, which includes the Defense Department budget, has amounted to about as much as 40 percent of the total federal budget in recent years. Second, the senator has been a big proponent of biennial budgeting, preparing and adopting budgets for two-year periods. The federal budget is currently adopted on an annual basis. Biennial budgeting proponents argue the idea would allow the federal government to adopt two budgets in one year and spend the second year taking more time to improve how government works. Others, including the Congressional Budget Office, have warned biennial budgeting could backfire if the revenue streams are uncertain, which makes it difficult to budget accurately.Third, Isakson supports the Pay It Back Act, which would require that money repaid by banks and other businesses who received taxpayer dollars from the Troubled Assets Relief Program (TARP) be used toward deficit reduction.The fourth idea is legislation introduced in 2006 and 2007 by U.S. Sen. Judd Gregg, R-N.H., called Stop Over-Spending. Isakson co-sponsored the bill. SOS aimed to reduce the federal deficit and essentially balance the budget by 2012 through slowing the rate of growth for entitlement programs, except for Social Security, if Congress doesn't meet deficit reduction targets. It also gave the president a line-item veto. The Senate never voted on the bill.The SOS bill received positive reviews from the conservative organizations National Review and the Heritage Foundation, saying it would have forced Congress into disciplined spending. University of Virginia political science professor James Savage was one of the few academics who studied the bill when it was introduced and he had problems with it. Savage and others contend that deficit reduction is not sound economic policy during a recession because more federal investment is needed to revive the economy, either through cutting taxes, lowering interest rates or spurring consumer spending through a stimulus. Now, let's look at whether Isakson has voted in favor of many substantial spending increases.Donovan's camp says Isakson went along with Republicans on a series of spending increases when the GOP controlled Congress. Much of Donovan's argument on this point deals with bills from 2001 to 2004, when Isakson was in the U.S. House. During that time, Isakson voted for several bills during a time when the gross federal debt grew from about $5.8 trillion at the end of fiscal year 2001 to nearly $7.4 trillion by the end of fiscal year 2004. The debt was projected to rise to $13.8 trillion for the fiscal year that ended Sept. 30. Isakson voted in 2002 to spend $350 billion over 10 years for a prescription drug benefit for Medicare. Additionally, he voted for bills that increased defense spending by about 10 percent a year and legislation that raised the discretionary spending cap from $661 billion in 2001 to $819 billion in 2004. The senator has been more of a fiscal hawk since Democrats became the majority party in Congress in 2007, Donovan said.The senator voted in 2006 with 51 of his 54 fellow Republicans to increase the national debt limit by $787 billion, raising the debt ceiling to $9 trillion. Some senators defended the decision, saying additional funds were needed for health and education programs. Isakson also voted in 2008 for the $700 billion TARP but has since criticized expansion of that legislation.So where does this leave us on Donovan's statement about Isakson? The October 1, 2010 truth-o-meter says an allegation made on the website of Chuck Donovan, Libertarian Party U.S. Senate candidate, is half true. The article notes that I researched and wrote the provision—which is correct. The provision reads: Mr. Isakson never proposed, nor voted in favor of, a substantial cut in federal spending; however, he has voted in favor of: (a) many substantial increases in federal spending; and (b) tremendous annual deficits. The article did not consider the four facets of the statement, but instead focused on spending. The allegedly untrue part is the part about Mr. Isaksons proposals relating to, and votes for, substantially cutting spending. Cited in favor of Mr. Isakson are proposed caps on discretionary spending, Mr. Isaksons support for biennial budgeting and Mr. Isaksons support of the Pay It Back Act, which reportedly requires money paid back by banks and other businesses who received taxpayer dollars from the TARP be used towards deficit reduction. These things are not bad things, but they do not reduce spending at all. Concerning caps on future discretionary spending, it appears the reporter or the truth-o-meter judges, or both, failed to distinguish a cut in spending from a limit on future spending increases. Also cited is the Stop Over Spending (SOS) bill, which I was told by the reporter with whom I met was the only thing the Isakson campaign cited in its defense. As I explained to the reporter, nothing in the SOS bill requires that any spending be substantially cut at all. I thoroughly provided reasoning therefore. I gave the reporter examples of things that would result in a substantial cut in spending, such as repeal of Medicare Part D. According to the Medicare Trustees, Medicare Part D had a present value liability figure in 2008 that exceeded 31 percent the net worth of all Americans combined as of the end of 2009. I encourage all readers to read the SOS bill (it can be found online). Also cited in favor of the senator is his vote against a spending increase relating to Iraq and Hurricane Katrina recovery efforts because it included $700 million in earmarks. Voting against a spending increase is not proposing, or voting in favor of, a cut (or a substantial cut) in spending. The only thing cited to cut spending was small proposed cut in Medicare and Medicaid that would reportedly have cut 2 percent from budget deficit forecasts over five years. The spending cuts were estimated to be $36 billion. The per-year average spending cut would be $7.2 billion (i.e. $36 billion divided by 5). Total federal spending for 2008 amounted to approximately $2,983 billion. I do not believe something that could cut spending by 0.2 percent (i.e. 7.2 divided by 2,983) could reasonably be considered to substantially cut spending. It is akin to a 2 cent saving on a good that would ordinarily cost $10. After publication, through email correspondence with the reporter, I was told the truth-o-meter judges felt the average person would consider the SOS and pay-go, etc. as significant efforts to cut spending. I replied by first noting that Senator Isakson consistently voted against pay-go when his party was in power. I also offered the following example that an ordinary reasonable person could understand: If an individual said his family spends $1,000 per week but plans to limit future spending increases, but the individual said no other actions would be taken regarding spending, no ordinary reasonable person would think that person had planned to cut his familys spending, let alone cut the spending substantially. Martindale-Hubbell is the organization that rates lawyers, and the rating is done by other lawyers. I have, and for many years have had, an AV rating from Martindale-Hubbell. An AV rating is the highest rating in terms of work quality and integrity (including honesty). Simply put, I tell the truth. In sum, Senator Isakson never proposed, nor voted in favor of, a substantial cut in spending. Thus, I told the truth. The GAO said in 2007: GAOs long-term simulations continue to show ever larger deficits resulting in a federal debt burden that ultimately spirals out of control. While I am very disheartened by the truth-o-meter article, what is really sad is that you have helped Mr. Isakson so he can continue fulfilling GAOs prophesy.

Final Rating: Half True  ","Americans will spend more on taxes in 2015 than on food, clothing and housing combined.","On April 14, 2015, Scott Walker asked followers of his personal Twitter account if theyve been taxed enough already. Did you know, Americans will spend more on taxes in 2015 than on food, clothing and housing combined? Walkers campaign team tweeted. (We know Walker didnt personally pen it because its signed TW, for Team Walker). The tweet highlighted a chart showing Americans collectively paid $4.8 trillion in taxes in 2014, more than the total of the three life essentials. Its a claim PolitiFact National checked in 2014 and 2011 after identical statements by the Tax Foundation and Republican National Committee chairman Reince Priebus, respectively. Both those were rated Half True. Lets see what the latest figures show. Digging into the numbers Walkers campaign told us he relied on the Tax Foundations annual tax freedom day report. Among other things, that report examines taxing and spending figures based on U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis data. Both the Tax Foundation and Walker make clear they are using collective taxing and spending figures -- by using a chart, in Walkers case, and words and charts in the Tax Foundations case. One cautionary note: Full data is not yet available for 2015, since we are not even at the midpoint of the year. The Tax Foundation based its claim about 2015 on 2014 figures that it adjusts for economic growth predicted by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, said Kyle Pomerleau, an economist with the group. We checked the BEAs data for 2014, the latest available, and found a significant edge for total taxes paid over the aggregate amount spend on food, housing and clothing. Total spending on groceries, restaurant meals, clothing, footwear, housing and utilities came to $4.2 trillion. Meanwhile, taxes -- local, state and federal -- rang up to $4.9 trillion. For perspective, total personal consumer expenditures, which includes additional things like vehicles, recreation and health care, were $11.9 trillion in 2014. In recent years, the federal figures show, taxes have consistently topped food, shelter and clothing. Another perspective But PolitiFact Nationals earlier work points out there is another way to look at the comparison: by examining what individual Americans pay. Thats a complex task, but one way to do it is to examine what people at different income levels spend and pay in taxes as a share of their total income. Through that lens, many poorer Americans likely pay a higher share of their income on food, shelter and clothing, in part because they pay little in taxes. Conversely, richer Americans may well pay a higher fraction of their income in taxes and a smaller share for those essentials. So by this other method, for many people, Walkers claim does not hold up. The 2014 item concluded that a majority of Americans probably pay more for the three essentials than for taxes. Our rating Walker claimed, based on what happened in 2014, that Americans in 2015 collectively will spend more on taxes than they do on food, housing and clothing combined. The statement is partially accurate -- on target based on past experience by the method Walker uses, but inaccurate by another method that examines the claim in a fuller context. Thats a Half True on our meter.",0.5,0.5,1.0,0.5,0.0,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,half-true

Final Rating: Half True  ",Republican state Sens. Paul Newton and Warren Daniel refused to even give testimony in North Carolinas latest redistricting case.,"Some North Carolina Democrats say gerrymandering efforts were worse in the state Senate than in the state House, in part because two Republican senators didnt testify during a recent redistricting trial. North Carolina legislators redraw the state voting maps every decade after new census data come out. The political party in power typically draws the districts to favor themselves, often prompting lawsuits from critics. That happened again last year. Voting rights groups sued leaders in the Republican-led state House and state Senate, arguing their maps are unconstitutional partisan gerrymanders. A panel of Superior Court judges ruled in favor of the Republicans. So the plaintiffs then appealed to the state Supreme Court. On Jan. 31, ahead of oral arguments before the high court, the North Carolina House Democrats Twitter account tweeted: House Republicans admitted to secret maps and destruction of evidence, but Sens. Paul Newton and Warren Daniel refused to even give testimony. So the question is—what the hell was going on in the [state Senate] that was so much worse than what was happening in the House? Republicans refuted the tweet. Senate Leader Phil Bergers communications team called the Democrats claim evidence-free conspiracy theorizing. Theres a lot to unpack in this tweet, which takes some facts from the redistricting case and frames them in a way that could lead some to think the lawmakers engaged in wrongdoing. First, a portion of the House Democrats claim about secret maps is accurate but some of it is difficult to prove. During the lower-court trial, Republican state Rep. Destin Hall said he and his staffers consulted secret concept maps while leading the chambers restricting process. He said the maps didnt incorporate any racial or partisan gerrymanders. But its unclear whether the maps were intentionally destroyed. The defendants, in court documents, said only that the maps were were not saved, are currently lost and no longer exist. While that may raise questions about records retention, it doesnt prove that the maps were intentionally destroyed. The state Supreme Court overturned the maps on Feb. 4, and ten days later cited the concept maps in its full opinion. One reason the N.C. House Democrats tweet stands out: the secret maps were on the House side—but the tweet makes claims about the Senate. As for Daniel and Newton testifying, its true that they declined to answer questions in a deposition. But its misleading to suggest their silence is indicative of wrongdoing, since they asked the court for—and were granted—protections offered by state laws. The tweet also could give some readers the impression that senate Republicans didnt answer questions at all. Thats not the case. Sen. Ralph Hise, the highest-ranking co-chairman of the state Senates redistricting committee, was deposed and later testified on the third day of the Superior Court trial. Lets review the facts. The N.C. House Democrats Twitter account is run by the Democratic Partys state House caucus. Amanda Eubanks, the caucus executive director, told PolitiFact NC the refused to testify claim is a reference to Daniel and Newton invoking legislative privilege, a state law that can protect legislators from having to provide information about some aspects of the lawmaking process. Before the redistricting trial, plaintiffs sought to depose Daniel, Newton, Berger and House Speaker Tim Moore, also a Republican. Those lawmakers cited legislative privilege and asked to be exempt from the depositions, a motion the court granted on Dec. 24. Once Daniel and Newton were exempted from depositions, they were viewed as ineligible to testify on the stand. So even if they wanted to testify in the trial, its unlikely that they would have been called upon. That said, the scope of legislative privilege is not well defined in state law. So, in a hypothetical case in which a legislator seeks to avoid questioning, a judge could compel a legislator to answer questions about details that arent protected by legislative immunity, lawyers told PolitiFact NC. There are some things in public records like communications between legislators and legislative staff, or when they go to the research group and say, If I propose this, is it legal? Youre not going to get it because its confidential, said Mike Tadych, a partner at law firm Stevens Martin Vaughn & Tadych PLLC, which represents the North Carolina Press Association. But in a trial, you typically cant just assert legislative privilege because youre a legislator and you dont want to talk, said Kym Hunter, a senior attorney for the Southern Environmental Law Center. Legislative privilege could apply potentially to certain parts of what they would be questioned about, but theres certainly many, many aspects which wouldn't be subject to legislative privilege. Voting rights group Common Cause, a plaintiff in the case, included Berger and Daniel on its witness list filing on Dec. 31—after the senators had already been granted legislative privilege. Common Cause didnt call upon either senator during trial, but in court documents the group said it reserves the right to challenge legislative privilege on appeal. The N.C. House Democrats tweet implies that silence by Daniel and Newton is indicative that the Senates behavior was somehow worse than that of Republicans in the House. The accusation is vague and hard to quantify without more information about what action is being measured. When it comes to alleged gerrymandering, none of the three maps drawn by Republican lawmakers stand out as being significantly more partisan than the others. Experts at Princeton University reviewed the state House, state Senate and the congressional maps, giving each an F grade, due to significant Republican advantage. We asked Eubanks what N.C. House Democrats meant by the statement, and she never directly answered the question. Hise, meanwhile, testified that the state Senate and House redistricting processes were very different. Hise noted that he, Daniel and Newton used the same staff assistance provided by Bergers office. He said he wasnt aware of any secret maps being used on the Senate side because all maps were required to be drawn in public view. Hise acknowledged that he never issued a specific directive banning staff from looking at concept maps outside of public view—something state Supreme Court justices noted in their recent opinion—but he said aides were aware of the rules. While the N.C. House Democrats tweet raises questions about the senate process, Berger spokeswoman Lauren Horsch noted that Hises testimony wasnt disputed in court. She added that Hise testified—and the others didnt—in part because the trial was under time constraints. The N.C. House Democrats Twitter account said Newton and Daniel refused to even give testimony in North Carolinas redistricting case. So the question is—what the hell was going on in the [state Senate] that was so much worse than what was happening in the House? Its true that they did not give testimony. But thats because the senators invoked a legal protection called legislative privilege that allowed them to opt out of answering questions in the case. That move alone doesnt necessarily mean they have something to hide. The tweet is partially accurate but leaves out important details, which is our definition of Half True.",0.5,0.5,1.0,0.5,0.0,0.5,0.5,1.0,0.5,half-true

Final Rating: Half True",Says IBM leader told Obama that using IBM technology to cut fraud could pay for health care reform.,"During a discussion of health care costs at a Nov. 5, 2011, two-person GOP presidential debate outside Houston, Republican presidential candidate Newt Gingrich made a dramatic claim about a White House visit.Gingrich, who was debating then-candidate Herman Cain, said: The CEO of IBM went to the White House and said to (President) Barack Obama, you can pay for virtually all of Obamacare by simply taking existing IBM technology and applying it to stop paying crooks.By Obamacare, a term that some view as polarizing shorthand, Gingrich meant the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, the Democrat-led 2010 overhaul of health care laws. Obama affixed a price tag of $900 billion to the plan when he rolled out his version in September 2009. Subsequent cost estimates varied. So, Gingrich is suggesting a lot of fraud. But was he right that IBM presented the president with such a scheme?By way of background, we note that Gingrich has long advocated using technology to help cut health-care costs. Until recently he led a for-profit consultancy called the Center for Health Transformations, which counted IBM among its clients.We asked Gingrichs campaign for the former House speakers basis in making the statement. Spokesman Joe DeSantis told us: All I can say is that he heard it from someone he trusts. Sorry.But DeSantis directed us to video of a Sept. 14, 2010, Wall Street Journal interview of Sam Palmisano, IBMs then-CEO and chairman.Separately, IBM spokesman Ed Barbini also referred us to the Journal interview. He declined further comment.The video opens with the Journals Alan Murray saying: When President Obama was elected, you started spending a fair amount of time at the White House.Palmisano: Yes, I did.Murray: What was that all about?Well, Palmisano replied, part of it was the administration was reaching out to the business community. I mean, I was one of many, obviously ... around economic (issues)... So we were having lots of input, lots of exchange. Thats what we all were working on at the time.Asked how he thought the White House visits had turned out, Palmisano replied: We havent made any progress. It doesnt mean there hasnt been a lot of interaction.Murray: Well, whats the point of interaction if it doesnt lead to progress?Palmisano: Youd have to ask the people who arent progressing.He added, Weve done tons of work, and for whatever sets of reasons, we havent been able to establish, be in sync with, the priorities.Palmisano offered an example: We -- and Im fairly confident about this one because it required no legislative change -- we could have improved quality and reduced the costs of the health-care system by $900 billion... It was self-funding. You could have insured anybody you wanted to, illegal aliens, dogs, cats, ponies, whatever, right? And the stuff was simple. Did not require any big legislative change.About $400 billion of the reduced costs could be realized through negotiating discounts with drug companies, just as IBM negotiates its own discounts, he said. Buy a nationwide discount, he said. Just like pharmaceutical companies sell to us on a nationwide discount. Its no different. I said, Take the IBM discount! Take the IBM discount. Another example of savings: Two hundred billion in fraud. That was a 3 percent improvement, by the way. This wasnt transformational. ... Theres so much fraud in the system -- 3 percent and then Year 7 was 8 percent, Year 5 was 5 percent. Its 200 billion.Murray: And why didnt they do that? Is there a fraud --Palmisano: I said we would do it for free to prove that it works. They turned us down. Youll have to ask them Free. Free wasnt good enough.Murray asks again: Why?Palmisano replies, I think what it is, not to be judgmental about these things, I really do think what it is is that we weren't aligning with the priorities. ... the priority at the time, if I stay on my example of health care, was not to reduce costs and improve quality. It was to provide insurance and coverage for more people. That was our priority in the line. All we said, if you did this you could fund the priority without increasing the deficit, taking taxes up. And we couldn't sell the case.Lets take a breath here. In the Journal interview, Palmisano insisted he gave the White House an offer to cover the $900 billion estimated cost of the health care plan -- with $200 billion coming from reduced fraud.We were unable to find independent confirmation of such an offer -- and our search of news archives indicates the CEOs comments to the Journal touched off only one follow-up news account. Nearly a month after the interview, on the Oct. 8, 2010, episode of a Fox News program, guest host Stuart Varney said that an IBM spokesman stood by Palmisanos claims.That program aired shortly after a more widely publicized event: On Oct. 6, 2010, Palmisano led a group of high-tech CEOs to the White House to present Obama with a proposal they said could save the government $1 trillion by 2020.Among the plans seven initiatives: saving $500 billion by streamlining supply chains and pushing suppliers to reduce costs; and saving $200 billion by using technology to better detect improper payments -- payments that prove to be unnecessary or fraudulent. The proposal cites an Office of Management and Budget estimate that Medicare accounted for $54 billion of the governments $98 billion in improper payments in 2009.By email, White House spokesman Brandon Lepow did not provide information confirming or denying Palmisanos claims to the Journal about presenting savings ideas. Lepow initially said companies including IBM had offered the administration help fighting fraud. He later told us he had learned his first statement was inaccurate. His follow-up statement said the administration and IBM had worked on possible projects but agreed not to move forward, although IBM is a partner in our work to fight fraud.Our rulingGingrich did not reveal the source of his claim or provide backup beyond the Journal interview. Meantime, the White House did not confirm or deny Palmisanos claims. Contrary to Gingrichs debate claim, though, the then-CEO said $200 billion in funding would come from cutting fraud -- not nearly enough to pay for the health-care overhaul.",0.5,0.5,1.0,0.5,0.0,0.0,0.5,0.5,0.5,half-true

Scott Walker didnt know which opponent he would face in the Nov. 6, 2018 general election, he tweeted this claim: A number of Democrats running for governor want to cut the prison population by 50% and that would require the release of thousands of violent felons.  Our rating was Half True. There was no evidence to back up the require part of Walkers claim, particularly if a 50 percent reduction were done over a period of years, rather than swiftly. A new, similar Walker attack — zeroing in on Tony Evers — has a similar problem. All our fact checks in the governors race. On Sept. 12, 2018, a month after Evers, the state schools superintendent, emerged from the primary as the Democratic nominee, Walker elevated his attack to a television ad. The governors spot begins with a narrator portraying Evers as putting the public at risk, saying he failed to remove abusive teachers from our schools. Then the narrator asserts that Evers wants to cut Wisconsin's prison population in half, a dangerous plan that today would mean releasing thousands of violent criminals back into our communities. Walkers use of the word today aims to avoid the problem that the word require caused in his previous fact check. That is, a 50 percent reduction today — rather than say, over a period of years — would require the release of thousands of inmates convicted of violent crimes. There are currently about 23,000 inmates, two-thirds of whom have committed a violent offense, according to the state Department of Corrections. That two-thirds portion includes inmates being held for a violent-crime conviction; and it includesthose who served their time behind bars for that original offense, but were returned to prison for violating conditions of probation orextended supervision that was also part of the sentence for the original offense. Violent offenses include crimes such as murder, rape and robbery, as well as crimes such as assault, extortion and hit-and-run with bodily injury. But Evers has not put a time frame on how he would achieve a 50 percent reduction. And its important to keep in mind that releasing half the inmates who are in prison isnt the only way to cut the prison population in half. Like us on Facebook. Follow us on Twitter: @PolitiFactWisc. On the day Walkers TV ad was released, Evers reacted by telling reporters: Thats a lie. I never said that. We will not release violent criminals. Were not going to get in the gutter with Scott Walker. (Walker has also made a claim similar to the one in his TV ad in a private telephone poll of voters done by his campaign.) To back the first part of Walkers claim — that Evers supports a 50 percent cut -- Walkers campaign cites an exchange during a July 12, 2018 debate between Democrats who were running for governor. A reference was made to the group Milwaukee Inner-City Congregations Allied for Hope. Moderator: The multi-racial interfaith organization MICAH launched a campaign in 2011 to cut the state prison population by half, from 22,000 to 11,000. It now sits at 23,000. Do you support that original goal, and how would you balance reducing the prison population — Evers: Absolutely, and that's a goal thats worth accomplishing  We have to stop people incarcerating people for non-violent crimes. The Walker campaign argues that Evers response means he is committing to a 50 percent reduction over four years because MICAHs website refers to a campaign in 2011 to get the 50 percent cut by 2015. But neither the question to Evers, nor his response, mentions four years. And we found no evidence that Evers has committed to any time frame. Evers has said Wisconsin should cut parole revocations and expand drug courts as ways of reducing the number of people being sent to prison. He has also said he would consider releasing some inmates early; treating 17-year-olds as juveniles instead of adults for criminal charges; and overhauling truth-in-sentencing so prisoners could be released for good behavior. Kenneth Streit, a clinical professor of law emeritus at the University of Wisconsin Law School, told us its possible to achieve a 50 percent cut without releasing inmates convicted of violent crimes — or at least not thousands of them. Streit has studied corrections policy since 1990 and has assisted the Legislature and the Department of Corrections in developing and evaluating adult community corrections programs. He said the population could be reduced by about 5 percent annually over the next decade through steps such as changing sentencing guidelines and tripling funding for treatment-based probation that would reduce the number of people going back to prison for probation revocations.  Whether a 10-year time frame, or longer, would be acceptable to advocates for the 50 percent reduction is unclear; many want a quicker turnaround. But, despite Walkers claim, its also not clear that Evers would seek a 50 percent cut over a period that would force the release of thousands of inmates convicted of violent crimes. One more point before we close: Ryan King, research director at the nonprofit Justice Policy Institute, who formerly did studies for the Urban Institute and the Pew Research Center, said research shows that people who are in prison for violence are less likely to be rearrested after release than people sentenced for other offenses. Walker says Evers wants to cut Wisconsin's prison population in half, a dangerous plan that today would mean releasing thousands of violent criminals back into our communities. Evers has stated that a 50 percent reduction is a goal. But he has not put a time frame on achieving that — a crucial factor in determining whether inmates of convicted of violent crimes would have to be released. Experts say a 50 percent reduction over a relatively short period, say a few years, would require the release of inmates convicted of violent crimes. But some say its possible to cut the population in half, perhaps over 10 years, without the release of any violent offenders, or at least not thousands of them.For a statement that is partially accurate, our rating is Half True.",0.5,0.7,0.9,0.6,0.8,0.7,0.4,0.6,0.5,half-true

Final Rating: Half True",Says Massachusetts has three state-mandated student tests and Finland just one.,"Saying Texas students face too many state-mandated exams, an East Texas member of the State Board of Education suggested two faraway places enjoy stellar results with minimal government-imposed testing.In an opinion column published in the Dec. 10, 2012, Austin American-Statesman, Thomas Ratliff, R-Mount Pleasant, said: Massachusetts, the envy of all public school systems in the United States, has three state-mandated tests. Finland, which is the envy of all public school systems in the world, has one. Thats right, one.We're not going to judge the merits of educational systems. But we have experience counting tests.Yet, as we tucked into this Massachusetts-Finland shout, we noticed Ratliffs article does not say if hes critical of every exam given under the State of Texas Assessments of Academic Readiness system. That testing starts in the third grade.By phone, Ratliff told us that he was thinking only of the state's 11 to 15 newly-installed end-of-course exams that high-school students must hurdle to qualify for graduation.So, what of Massachusetts and Finland?Ratliff said he drew his Massachusetts test count from Austin lawyer Dineen Majcher, who helped launch Texans Advocating for Meaningful Student Assessment amid concerns the 2009 Legislature's overhaul of student testing and accountability went overboard.Majcher pointed us to a Massachusetts government web page, for the Bay States Department of Elementary and Secondary Education, indicating that high-school students should attain proficient scores on tests in English language arts and math and a test in any of several science-oriented subjects: biology, chemistry, introductory physics or technology/engineering. Students who do not meet the states proficient score on either test can still graduate, according to the agency, by fulfilling an educational proficiency plan entailing more classwork and testing.By email, department spokesman J.C. Considine told us that outside of the states high-school tests, students in grades three through eight must take standardized state exams. According to an agency web page, results are used to hold schools accountable for progress toward the federal goal that all U.S. students be proficient in reading and math by 2014.Now lets flip to Finland.Ratliff pointed us to an article in the September 2011 issue of Smithsonian, the magazine produced by the Smithsonian Institution, saying that students there have outperformed counterparts in other countries thanks to in a focus on well-prepared teachers who decide how best to school their individual pupils. The story also says there are no mandated standardized tests in Finland, apart from one exam at the end of students senior year in high school.The test is the Finnish Matriculation Exam, according to a Finnish government web page, which says the exams purpose is to discover whether pupils have assimilated the knowledge and skills required by the curriculum for the upper secondary school and whether they have reached an adequate level of maturity in line with that school`s goals. Passing the Matriculation Examination entitles the candidate to continue his or her studies at university.According to the web page, the exam is given each spring and fall.However, the exam is not a one-and-done. Its composed of at least four tests, one that each student must take in his or her mother tongue—Finnish, Swedish or Saami—and three others at their choice either on the second national language or a foreign language; math; or a test in the sciences and humanities, according to the web page, including tests in Evangelical Lutheran religion, Orthodox religion, ethics, philosophy, psychology, history, social studies, physics, chemistry, biology, geography and health education.As part of his or her examination, the candidate may additionally include one or more optional tests, the web page says.Whoa. Could each student really take more than 10 tests?Pasi Sahlberg, a Finnish expert in education and director general of the Helsinki-based Centre for International Mobility and Cooperation, confirmed by email that the overall standardized exam consists of a minimum of four tests, but students if they wish can take more exams. Typically, he said, students take five or six tests. These may be spread over a 12-month period, he said, though most students take most of their tests in the spring of their last school year. Notably, too, Sahlberg emailed, Finnish students who focus on vocational training after completing the countrys nine mandatory years of basic education do not have to take a state-mandated exam of any kind. In 2010, 45 percent of the students who continued their schooling after the nine years chose the vocational track, Satu Mäki-Lassila of Finlands Ministry of Education and Culture told us by email.Our rulingRatliff wrote that Massachusetts has three mandated student tests and Finland one.Both claims reflect the exams that students in Massachusetts and Finland have to take to qualify for high school graduation.But students on the academic track in Finland must take at least four separate tests. Also, given that Ratliffs article does not say hes speaking only to tests administered in high school, its worth noting that Massachusetts, like Texas, requires students starting in third grade to take state tests.This claim grades out as Half True. CLARIFICATION, 10:00 a.m., Dec. 19, 2012: We amended this article to point out that Finnish students who focus on vocational courses at the secondary level do not have to take a government-mandated exam to graduate.

Final Rating: Half True  ",The income tax that started at 2 percent under Governor Byrne is now 9 percent.,"Whet the appetite of liberal politicians with a new tax and Gov. Chris Christie warns theyll become ravenous. Thats why Christie told a crowd in New Hampshire they should vote on Nov. 6 for Ovide Lamontagne, the Republican candidate for governor of the Granite State. Otherwise New Hampshire, which doesnt tax wages, may go the way of New Jersey.Christie said 35 years ago New Jersey also didnt have an income tax, but then Governor Brendan Byrne, a Democrat, said if you just give me a small income tax, just a little one, I will lower your property taxes, for the people who have the highest property taxes in America back in 1977. So 35 years later, what have we got? We still have the highest property taxes in America and the income tax that started at 2 percent under Governor Byrne is now 9 percent -- 9 percent.Here's the key everybody: you let a liberal politician in the door and give them permission to give you a new tax, they only know one direction for that tax to go and that's up, Christie said at the Sept. 25 event.Did New Jerseys income tax more than quadruple since it was first enacted, as Christie said?The governors statement is partially accurate because a group of individuals -- those earning more than $500,000 in taxable income -- are now subject to a statutory income tax rate of 8.97 percent.But those individuals represent only a small percentage of filers in New Jersey and the tax rates are lower for other income levels. The governors office did not respond to requests for comment, but the history of the states income tax is clear.In 1976 -- during Byrnes first term -- the state passed a temporary income tax with two rates. A 2 percent rate was levied on income less than $20,000 or about $80,000 in todays dollars, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. Income in excess of $20,000 was taxed at the top rate of 2.5 percent. A year after the temporary tax was enacted, the state made it permanent. Over time New Jersey modeled its income tax into a more progressive system, which now has rates ranging from 1.4 percent to 8.97 percent depending on income level and filing status.The states top rate is 8.97 percent, which only applies to income in excess of $500,000. Less than 2 percent of taxable New Jersey resident returns in 2009 had that level of income, according to state Treasury Department data. An individual with taxable income between $75,000 and $500,000 pays a 6.37 percent rate on that income. For income between $40,000 and $75,000, the rate is about 5.5 percent.The lowest rates are 1.4 percent and 1.75 percent, which are lower than the states rates in 1976. Those rates apply to incomes below $20,000 or between $20,000 and $35,000, respectively.So for Christie to suggest the income tax, in general, jumped from 2 percent to 9 percent is misleading. Thats true for one income level, but the statement oversimplifies New Jerseys current income tax system.Our rulingChristie said, The income tax that started at 2 percent under Governor Byrne is now 9 percent.When the state first implemented an income tax in 1976, two rates existed -- 2 percent for income less than $20,000 and 2.5 percent for income more than $20,000 -- but the state has since introduced a more progressive tax system. New Jerseys top rate is nearly 9 percent now, but applies only to taxable income above $500,000.Every other income bracket is subject to a rate lower than 9 percent, with some income levels charged a rate of less than 2 percent.To comment on this ruling, go to NJ.com.

Final Rating: Half True  ","Less than two years ago, we made a commitment to repay the U.S. . . .taxpayers in full, and today we made good on that promise.","In an announcement reminiscent of one made by GM around this time last year, Chrysler Group LLC boasted this week that it had paid back money lent to it by the American government, with interest, six years ahead of schedule.President Barack Obama, who is expected to highlight the milestone in a visit to a Toledo, Ohio, Chrysler plant on June 3, called the repayment a significant milestone for the turnaround of Chrysler and the countless communities and families who rely on the American auto industry. He and other Democrats adopted an I-told-you-so stance, with some Democrats taking the opportunity to remind the public that many Republicans opposed the auto bailouts.In a press release from Chrysler Group LLC announcing the loan repayment, the company's Chief Executive Officer Sergio Marchionne stated, Less than two years ago, we made a commitment to repay the U.S. and Canadian taxpayers in full, and today we made good on that promise.For this item, we're going to focus on whether the company repaid U.S. taxpayers. Chrysler Group LLC repaid $5.1 billion in Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) loans and formally terminated its ability to draw from a remaining $2.1 billion line of credit extended through TARP. Together with interest and fees, Chrysler Group has now paid $6.5 billion to the U.S. Treasury. It borrowed $5.1 billion from the U.S. government when it began operations under new ownership in June 2009. In addition, the U.S. Treasury still holds a 6.6 percent common equity stake in Chrysler Group.So is Chrysler now really square with the American taxpayer?The press release doesn't mention it, but there's more to the government's investment in Chrysler than the loans to Chrysler Group LLC.In its own press release about Chrysler's loan repayment, the U.S. Department of Treasury lays out a more complete picture of taxpayer support of Chrysler:Treasury committed a total of $12.5 billion to Chrysler under TARPs Automotive Industry Financing Program (AIFP), the release states. With todays transaction, Chrysler has returned more than $10.6 billion of that amount to taxpayers through principal repayments, interest, and cancelled commitments. Treasury continues to hold a 6.6 percent common equity stake in Chrysler. As previously stated, however, Treasury is unlikely to fully recover its remaining outstanding investment of $1.9 billion in Chrysler.In an interview with MSNBC's Andrea Mitchell on May 24, 2011, Ron Bloom, assistant to President Obama in charge of manufacturing policy, broke it down more plainly:Today, Chrysler is reducing their obligation to the U.S. taxpayer by $8 billion. They have previously provided us with $2.6 billion of funds. So, that $10.6 (billion) stacks up against $8.5 billion that the president invested in Chrysler and $4 billion from the prior administration. So, that's over 100 percent of all monies that this administration invested and about 85 percent of the total invested funds by the United States government.So how can the Chrysler Group LLC claim to have squared its obligation to the American taxpayers when only 85 percent of the taxpayers' investment in Chrysler has been recouped?Notice how we keep writing Chrysler Group LLC. There's a reason for that. That's the new Chrysler company that emerged from bankruptcy in 2009.We'll let Gualberto Ranieri, head of communications for the Chrysler Group LLC, explain.Ranieri likened the generic use of the word Chrysler to a fruit salad, which is made up of lots of different fruits: apples, strawberries, blueberries...you get the idea. When you talk about Chrysler, there's not just one company. There's the old Chrysler, the company that was liquidated in bankruptcy. There's the new Chrysler, aka Chrysler Group LLC, the newly formed company that purchased most of the assets of Old Chrysler in a bankruptcy sale. There's also the financing firms Chrysler Financial and GMAC.We are not responsible for the old Chrysler, Ranieri said. We are not responsible for Chrysler Financial. I am not responsible for my brother's loans, even though we have the same last name.Chrysler Group CEO Marchionne can only speak for the new company, Ranieri said, and the government money extended to Chrysler Group has been fully repaid, with interest.That's technically true, Edward Niedermeyer, editor-in-chief of The Truth About Cars website wrote this week. It does, however, fail to account (again) for the $1.9 billion Debtor-in-Possession 'loan' which financed Chrysler during bankruptcy and was conveniently left to die with the remains of 'Old Chrysler.' Nor does it account for the $1.5 billion loaned to Chryslers suppliers to keep them afloat amidst the bailout chaos.Chrysler and its political bedfellows should be forgiven for a little cheering, Niedermeyer wrote. The loan repayment is a positive sign of hope for a once seemingly doomed company.Its just that taxpayers still deserve a full and transparent accounting of 'every penny' (to borrow a phrase) that actually went into Chrysler, not just 'loans made in the last two years' or 'loans made by the Obama Administration' or other weasel-wordings employed to make the bailout seem more successful than it is, Niedermeyer wrote. Though bailout supporters will doubtless argue that 'it doesnt matter' because Chrysler is alive today and 'thats what matters,' this doesnt justify a lack of transparency. In fact, if the bailout was successful because GM and Chrysler survived, thats all the more reason to not fear the truth about what the bailout actually cost.James Gattuso, a senior research fellow in regulatory policy at the conservative Heritage Foundation, said there was nearly $2 billion in taxpayer money that went down with the ship with the old shell of Chrysler. Technically, he said, Chrysler Group LLC is a different company. But from a taxpayers' perspective, there's little distinction.If the taxpayers were a bank, they wouldn't stay in business very long, he said. The taxpayers took a loss, or they are still in the red at least.Now, the U.S. Treasury still owns a 6.6 percent common equity stake in Chrysler Group. That has an undetermined value, as the company has not yet gone public. But as the Treasury itself acknowledged, Treasury is unlikely to fully recover its remaining outstanding investment of $1.9 billion in Chrysler.We asked Lawrence J. White, a professor of economics at the Stern School of Business at New York University what he made of Marchionne's statement.This certainly appears to be another instance of careful language, where all of Chrysler's statement is focused on loans to Chrysler but not the other Treasury investments, White said. Yes, this appears to be an incomplete statement.As we noted earlier, the statements made by Marchionne were similar to those made by General Motors CEO Ed Whitacre last year. But the situations are different. For one, the government took a much larger equity stake in GM. For more details, see our fact-check related to Whitacre's claims last year.Again, there may be cause for celebratory comments from Chrysler. But Marchionne's statement, while technically accurate, doesn't tell the full story. Yes, Chrysler Group LLC has fully repaid the loans made to it two years ago. But that's not the full measure of the American taxpayers' investments to try to save Chrysler, including $2 billion to old Chrysler that was wiped out in bankruptcy. We doubt taxpayers care much about the distinctions in corporate titles. The government has now gotten most of its money back, but not all of it. Not yet anyway. UPDATE: The original version of this article mentioned Canadian taxpayers in the quotation. But since we are focusing on U.S, contributions, the reference to Canada was removed from the statement.",0.5,0.5,1.0,0.5,0.0,0.5,0.5,1.0,0.5,half-true

Final Rating: Half True",Two-thirds of our kids cant read at grade level.,"Republican presidential candidate Marco Rubio pulled out a stunning statistic about the current state of K-12 education while making the case for school choice. Two-thirds of our kids cant read at grade level, Rubio wrote in a recent Medium post. We wondered whether the situation in American schools was really that bad, so we took a closer look. Rubios source was the National Assessment of Educational Progress, or NAEP, a closely watched, federally sponsored standardized-testing effort. The most recent NAEP data for fourth- and eighth-grade students covers 2015. It offers four categories of achievement. From lowest to highest, they are below basic, basic, proficient, and advanced. The two most relevant categories for this fact-check are basic and proficient, and neither levels definition mentions reading on grade level. Basic is defined as denoting partial mastery of prerequisite knowledge and skills that are fundamental for proficient work at each grade assessed. Proficient is defined as representing solid academic performance for each grade assessed and competency over challenging subject matter, including subject-matter knowledge, application of such knowledge to real-world situations, and analytical skills appropriate to the subject matter. Rubio is using the proficient level as his benchmark, and the picture that produces isnt pretty. In 2015, just 36 percent of American fourth graders were categorized as either proficient or advanced in reading. Heres the chart:  And that same year, just 34 percent of eighth graders rated as either proficient or advanced in reading. Heres the chart:  Using that metric, Rubio supports his point. But education experts advised caution. Most important is that its a bit of a stretch for Rubio to equate a NAEP rating of proficient with being at grade level. There is no commonly accepted definition for what grade level performance is or should be, said Christopher B. Swanson, vice president of Editorial Projects in Education, which publishes Education Week. NAEP, he said, is developed independently of the knowledge required by any specific state, district or school. David Bills, a professor of education at the University of Iowa, agreed. As far as I know, no one has ever tested those labels against what kids actually need to know to do well in school, Bills said. Indeed, after the No Child Left Behind education law was enacted under President George W. Bush, each state had to choose a level of proficiency, and on average, this came closer to the NAEP basic level, said Eric Hanushek, a senior fellow in education policy at the conservative Hoover Institution. If this is the case, then one could instead use the basic level under NAEP and find that the success rates are 69 percent and 76 percent for fourth and eighth graders, respectively. Still, despite such words of caution, experts said Rubios decision to use the proficient level as his benchmark was defensible. Experts also ratified Rubios use of the NAEP tests as his data source. Sure, there are lots of problems and its not a perfect measure, but that doesnt mean its meaningless in all contexts, said Patricia M. Cooper, an associate professor and program coordinator for early childhood education at Queens College-City University of New York. There arent many credible alternatives to the NAEP numbers, she said. Cooper added that even the best-case scenario isnt that great. Even if Rubios off by half, that means one-third of our kids arent reading on grade level, she said. Would that make us feel better? Our ruling Rubio said that two-thirds of our kids cant read at grade level. The numbers from the NAEP reading test for fourth and eighth graders provide some support for his statement. However, experts said that there is no accepted definition of what being at grade level means under the NAEP tests. While Rubio's use of NAEP's higher proficient standard is a reasonable choice, experts said, it's not the only one -- many states have set standards aligned with NAEP's basic level instead.",0.5,0.5,1.0,0.5,0.0,0.5,0.5,1.0,0.5,half-true

Final Rating: Half True  ","Already, the Affordable Care Act is helping to slow the growth of (Medicares) health care costs.","In his State of the Union address, President Barack Obama warned those who love Medicare that changes to the program are needed, because rising health care costs for seniors are the biggest driver of our long-term debt.If changes arent made, Obama warned, our retirement programs will crowd out the investments we need for our children, and jeopardize the promise of a secure retirement for future generations.Obama said he was open to changes such as asking wealthier seniors to pay more, and paying hospitals and doctors to be more efficient. But he also took credit for his signature health care law.Already, the Affordable Care Act is helping to slow the growth of health care costs, he said.From our previous fact-checking, we know that many of the major provisions of the 2010 health care law have yet to take effect. So how can the law already be slowing the growth of health care costs? We decided to check it out.Slowing spendingAs Obama made his speech, the White House posted slides on its website to back up Obamas key points.For his health care comment, a chart showed Medicare spending projections from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, both before the passage of the Affordable Care Act and afterward. The chart shows the future growth noticeably slowing after the laws passage. (View the chart here.) The numbers were part of the CBO's regular update on the countrys economic outlook and the federal budget. We reviewed the latest numbers, which were released on Feb. 5, 2013, as well as news coverage of the findings.In its report, the CBO says that health care spending has grown much more slowly in recent years, both for federal programs and overall, than it did in previous years. In response to that slowing growth, the CBO reduced its projections for future Medicare spending. Since March 2010, the CBO has lowered its projections for Medicare spending in 2020 by roughly 15 percent, the report said.However, the CBO did not specifically credit the Affordable Care Act as the reason for lowering the projections. Some aspects of the law, the report said, will slightly increase federal outlays in Medicare and Medicaid.But the CBO did say it was revising estimates based on actual reduced growth in health care spending since at least 2010.Health care law phasing inAs we noted above, the health care law isnt fully in effect yet. A new requirement for Americans to get health insurance or pay a penalty won't take effect until 2014, for example.For the Medicare program, the law includes both spending and cost savings.Beneficiaries can now receive expanded prescription drug coverage and preventive care without co-pays under the law; but those benefits increase costs.On the other hand, the law has also put in place limits on payments to private insurance companies that operate the Medicare Advantage program, which saves money. Changes in payments to hospitals have also already started. That means financial incentives for hospitals that are more efficient and penalties for those that are not.When we asked White House staff for more evidence to support Obamas comments, they pointed us to a January memo from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, which specifically pointed to limits on Medicare Advantage and changes to hospital payments.Finally, a controversial Medicare payments commission -- the Independent Payment Advisory Board -- would make recommendations to make payments more efficient, reducing spending. But that board hasnt yet convened, and it may never convene if Medicare meets pre-determined budget targets.Trends in health care spendingGetting back to health care costs, its clear that the growth in spending is going down, both for overall health spending and Medicare. But whats driving it? We found that experts consider it something of an interesting puzzle.Some blame the recession and the economy. When people feel poor, they dont spend as much, even on health care. Under this scenario, health care spending will rebound when the economy is better.Others say the overall health care system is changing, moving away from payments for each procedure and test, and moving toward payments for better overall outcomes. The health care law includes provisions to encourage that switch. If this is the case, reduced spending growth should become permanent.We found a diversity of opinion on whats going on here, and whether Obamas comment was accurate.Medicare spending slowed down in 2010-12, so this is not just a projection, said Jonathan Oberlander, a professor of health policy at the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill. Much of the law is not yet implemented, yet some Affordable Care Act provisions to control Medicare spending -- like changes in what Medicare Advantage plans are paid -- are already in effect, and were expected to produce savings during 2011-12.Other experts are dubious that the law is having much effect at all, such as Yuval Levin, a fellow at the Ethics and Public Policy Center and a domestic policy staffer on health care issues for President George W. Bush.The reduction in overall health costs has had above all to do with the weak economy, and while CBO does suggest that its projections of the effects of the Affordable Care Act have changed in a few ways since it passed in 2010 (causing both upward and downward revisions of the effects on costs), those are all projections for after 2014, when the key substantive provisions of the law will take effect, he said. None of them could be used to suggest that already, the Affordable Care Act is helping to slow the growth of health care costs.The Obama administration argues that its more than a weak economy driving reductions in spending. The economic recession may have contributed to the 2010-12 decrease in growth in per beneficiary spending as consumers use less care due to its cost, says the HHS memo. However, as almost all Medicare beneficiaries have supplemental coverage and thus face relatively low out-of-pocket costs, it seems unlikely that consumer behavior alone is responsible for the slow growth in Medicare spending.Deborah Chollet, a senior fellow at Mathematica Policy Research, said the health care system is responding to the new law already. Insurance companies and other payers know about the new payment methods the law supports, and they are planning accordingly, she said.Its really not at all a situation of the lights turning on Jan. 1, 2014. The lights have been on for the past six months, she said.Still, determining causes behind the spending slowdown is no easy task, warned Bradley Herring, professor at the Bloomberg School of Public Health at Johns Hopkins University.I think most people think the slowdown weve seen in health care spending over the last three years has been due to the recession. But no ones 100 percent sure why that happened, he said.Things will get even more complicated for health policy researchers as the law deploys changes to payments and other pilot programs. Researchers will have to hypothesize how much costs decline compared with if the law had not passed.Those are going to be difficult things to measure, Herring said.Well close with comments from Douglas Elmendorf, head of the Congressional Budget Office. He spoke to reporters when the office released new numbers on Feb. 5:So, health spending has grown slowly over the past few years, both in federal programs and in the rest of the health care systems. We think that part of that owes to the recession and the loss of income in wealth, but we think that a significant part of that probably does not stem from the recession, probably arises from structural changes in the health care system.The critical question is, whether those structural changes are very transitory changes or whether they will persist. We're doing analysis to that question. We're talking with outside experts who are also investigating the same question. I think the short summary of that is that we don't know.Our rulingObama said, Already, the Affordable Care Act is helping to slow the growth of health care costs.Hes right that health care costs are slowing, but theres not conclusive evidence that the law is helping. The nonpartisan reports from the Congressional Budget Office dont specifically say that, and some aspects of the health law translate to increased spending.Among health care experts, we found debate over how much the Affordable Care Act is contributing to an overall slowdown in health spending. Some argue that the recession is making people spend less on health care. Others say the health care system is changing to become more efficient. Many say that more study is needed.Obamas taking credit for more than he can prove.",0.5,0.5,1.0,0.6,0.2,0.5,0.4,0.7,0.5,half-true

Final Rating: Half True",John McCain fought to rein in Fannie and Freddie...but Democrats blocked the reforms.,"Seeking to portray Sen. John McCain as prescient on the financial crisis, McCain's campaign unveiled anew advertisementsaying he had spotted problems with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac two years ago. John McCain fought to rein in Fannie and Freddie ... but Democrats blocked the reforms, McCain's new ad says. As evidence, the ad points to McCain's support of a bill in 2006 to strengthen oversight of Fannie and Freddie, and Democrats' opposition to that bill.Those points merit caveats, but first, some context. Fannie and Freddie, private corporations created and sponsored by Congress to lower the cost of mortgage capital, quintupled in size between 1995 and 2004, as they pioneered the practice of selling bundled mortgages in the form of securities. Federal officials in both the Bill Clinton and George W. Bush administrations sought greater authority to regulate them, but were largely stymied by Congress. In early September 2008, with home values plummeting,the government seized control of Fannie and Freddie to prevent them from failing, a move that could cost U.S. taxpayers tens of billions of dollars. McCain has taken heat for recent revelations that Freddie Mac paid a lobbying firm co-owned by his campaign manager, Rick Davis, $15,000 a month from 2005 through August 2008. But the campaign has called attention — in advertisements like this one — to McCain's support for tighter oversight of the companies. McCain did indeed co-sponsor the Federal Housing Enterprise Regulatory Reform Act of 2005, a bill that would have enhanced oversight of Freddie and Fannie. Sen. Chuck Hagel, R-Neb.,introduced the bill in January 2005 and immediately garnered co-sponsorship from two other Republican senators. McCain signed on in May 2006 after a damning federal report on accounting practices at Fannie Mae was released. If Congress does not act, American taxpayers will continue to be exposed to the enormous risk that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac pose to the housing market, the overall financial system, and the economy as a whole, he said ina statement. The National Association of Home Builders opposed the bill, as did the National Association of Realtors. Senate Democrats said they supported some form of stricter oversight, but would not support a provision of Hagel's bill that would limit the size of the company's portfolios. Negotiations stalled and the bill never made it to the floor. Does McCain's support for that bill amount to fighting to rein in Freddie and Fannie? Sort of. Others had been fighting for Fannie-and-Freddie reform for more than a decade, and McCain signed ontothe bill a year-and-a-half after it was introduced. And hereportedlydidn't do too much for the bill beyond co-sponsoring it and issuing a statement. The McCain campaign has also noted that in 2003 he was one of five Republican senators to co-sponsor a prior bill to tighten oversight of Fannie and Freddie. Still, if he fought for reform, it wasn't exactly guns-a-blazin'. Did Democrats block the reforms? More or less. They preferred a pared-down bill, and so did not support Hagel's. McCain overstates his role in pushing for Fannie and Freddie reform, and slightly oversimplifies the dynamic at work in the Senate.

Final Rating: Half True  ",Obamacare will mean 2.1 million fewer jobs by 2021.,"Opponents of the federal health care law recently got what they believe supports their argument that Congress should pull the plug on the legislation. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office projected that the law will push many Americans from the workforce. The Georgia chapter of Americans for Prosperity, a longtime critic of the law, held a rally at the state Capitol calling for the repeal of the controversial law, citing the CBOs projections. The Affordable Care Act has been disastrous for Georgians, causing premiums around the state to shoot up dramatically and causing many Georgians to lose their previous insurance. All this, despite the presidents promise that if you like your plan, you can keep it, AFP Communications Director Joel Aaron Foster said. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office says Obamacare will mean 2.1 million fewer jobs by 2021. PolitiFact Georgia wondered whether the Georgia chapter was correct in its interpretation about the potential number of jobs lost as a result of the law. Our partners at PolitiFact in Washington had looked at a similar claim and found one major flaw. The National Republican Congressional Committee claimed in a television ad that Nonpartisan government analysts say Obamacare will cost our economy up to 2.5 million jobs. PolitiFact noted that the CBO report did not use the word jobs. CBOs updated estimate of the decrease in hours worked translates to a reduction in full-time-equivalent employment of about 2.0 million in 2017, rising to about 2.5 million in 2024, compared with what would have occurred in the absence of the ACA, the CBO report said. The CBO report suggested some people will choose to work fewer hours, others may quit their jobs in order to get health care subsidies they would not receive if they continued to work their regular schedule. Because some people will reduce the amount of hours they work rather than stopping work altogether, the number who will choose to leave employment because of the ACA in 2024 is likely to be substantially less than 2.5 million, the CBO report said. PolitiFact noted: An important distinction in the report is that labor force will reduce by the equivalent of 2.5 million full-time workers over the next decade. That doesnt mean 2.5 million people will leave their jobs. Some people will only cut back a few hours or leave a second part-time job while others may stop working entirely. PolitiFact rated the National Republican Congressional Committees claim Mostly False. We contacted Americans for Prosperity Georgia to see whether there was any additional context it has that may show it should earn a better rating on the Truth-O-Meter. The groups spokesman, Foster, said the chapter stands by its statement. He pointed to other news coverage that used the same terminology to describe the conclusion the CBO reached in its report. The CBO report said the health care law will cause Americans to cut their work hours, equating to 2 million fewer jobs in 2017. That number is predicted to eventually rise to the equivalent of 2.5 million jobs in 2024, Politico reported. We found other prominent news outlets used similar language in their initial coverage. Several million American workers will reduce their hours on the job or leave the workforce entirely because of incentives built into President Barack Obama's health care overhaul, the Congressional Budget Office said Tuesday, The Associated Press reported in an article that was published in The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. That would mean losses equal to 2.3 million full-time jobs by 2021, in large part because people would opt to keep their income low to stay eligible for federal health care subsidies or Medicaid, the agency said. It had estimated previously that the law would lead to 800,000 fewer jobs by that year. Some major news outlets described it differently, sticking closer to the CBOs description of its projection. The Washington Posts Fact Checker, though, explained there is a difference. [W]e should note that the figures (2 million, etc.) are shorthand for full-time equivalent workers — a combination of two conclusions: fewer people looking for work and some people choosing to work fewer hours. The CBO added those two things and produced a hard number, but it actually does not mean 2 million fewer workers, it reported. Our conclusion We debated long and hard about this one. Americans for Prosperity Georgia did capture the general theme of what the CBO tried to say about the impact of the health care law on employment. It will result in fewer people working fewer hours. But its terminology was not entirely accurate. The CBO report did not say the health care law would result in a reduction of 2.5 million jobs. It specifically said more than 2.5 million people are likely to reduce the amount of labor they choose to supply to some degree and added that many of them will not leave the labor force entirely. We believe that is an important distinction. This claim does contain some element of truth, but some of the details are incorrect.",0.5,0.5,1.0,0.5,0.0,0.5,0.5,1.0,0.5,half-true

Final Rating: Half True",A proposed bill in the Florida Legislature would authorize the public hoarding of cats by feral cat activists.,"Florida legislators are taking up the usual public policy topics this session: health care, taxes and campaign finance reform. Then theres the bill about feral cats. Dont call them feral cats, though. Bills in the Legislature are re-branding them with a more user-friendly name: community cats. Not so fast, say the bird lovers. The American Bird Conservancy is crying fowl, er foul. The bills would authorize the public hoarding of cats by feral cat activists, in the face of potential public health and property value impacts, as well as predicted high mortality for native animals, the groups said in a press release. The conservancy says passage of two bills (HB 1121/SB 1320) would make it easier for people to dump unwanted cats in areas where they roam aplenty. This is shocking, said Grant Sizemore, the conservancys Cats Indoors program manager. Hoarding of animals in homes is prohibited in most places, but we now have Florida encouraging it in public places such as city parks. There is no question that the health of local citizenry -- including children -- is being put at risk, property values in the hoarding areas will be impacted and local wildlife will continue to be devastated. PolitiFact Florida wanted to research whether this bill would allow cat hoarding. The cat bills The Community Cats legislation, sponsored by Rep. Holly Raschein, R-Key Largo, and Sen. Darren Soto, D-Orlando, attempts to rein in cat overpopulation. Several communities have established programs to spay and care for feral cats and release them, however there were concerns among some involved in such programs that the release of cats would constitute abandonment and violate state animal cruelty laws. The bill amends the states animal cruelty law to state that someone who spays or neuters a feral cat and then releases it is not abandoning the cat or breaking the law. The bill also states that counties and cities can still adopt their own ordinances to curtail the feral cat population. The bill defines a community cat as an outdoor, free-roaming cat that lacks visible owner identification and defines a community cat owner as someone who gives that cat food or water. Cat and wildlife activists have been battling each other about how to handle feral cats for years. A 2003 Tampa Bay Times article described a cat vs. rat battle at the Ocean Reef Club, an exclusive community of multimillion-dollar homes near a state park and wildlife refuge. Homeowners set up a program to take care of hundreds of stray cats, but meanwhile the populations of the Key Largo wood rat and cotton mouse, both endangered, dwindled. Wildlife experts pointed fingers at the cats. It's a very serious problem for Key Largo wood rats, University of Florida wildlife scientist Frank Mazzotti said at the time. Releasing a feral cat in a natural area is like releasing a serial murderer in a maternity ward. Central to the bill debate is whether programs that encourage the trap, neuter and release of feral cats reduce the feral cat population and the dangers to wildlife and humans. A study by scientists including from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service estimated that cats kill up to 3.7 billion birds a year, and found no connection between the programs (called TNR) and fewer bird deaths. Claims that TNR colonies are effective in reducing cat populations, and, therefore, wildlife mortality, are not supported by peer-reviewed scientific studies, it said. A 2003 Florida International University study concluded that TNR cat programs at two parks encouraged illegal dumping of cats and led to a population increase at one park, while the other remained stable. The Florida Department of Health, which remains neutral on the cat bill, stated in a 2012 rabies prevention report that managing feral cats is not tenable on public health grounds because of the persistent threat posed to communities from injury and disease. Bill supporters point to a study published in the journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association that concluded a TNR program at the University of Central Florida reduced the population. They also point to this research about the benefits of vaccinating cats. Would this lead to hoarding? So there is evidence that feral cats carry diseases and kill wildlife. But would this bill allow animal hoarding? A spokeswoman for the Humane Society, a group supporting the bill, said bill opponents are misusing the word hoarding. Animal hoarding is a serious mental illness, Humane society spokeswoman Katie Lisnik told PolitiFact. It is a severe case of neglect and abuse of animals. Thats different from programs that care for cats, she said. Hoarding -- generally speaking, not exclusively to animals -- will be listed by the American Psychiatric Associations Diagnostic and statistical Manual for the first time this year, said Smith College psychology professor Randy Frost who studies hoarding. We asked Frost if Floridas bill could lead to increased hoarding. I dont know that there is any way to tell, he said. I think it would be hard to hoard in a field or public place. ... I dont know of many cases of hoarding where hoarding occurred in public. Id have to think about that. Brevard County recently placed a moratorium on registration for cat colonies -- county officials know of several hundred colonies. Bob Brown, captain of enforcement for Brevard County animal services, said he doesnt think he would call these cat colonies hoarding. In a cat colony, they have no control if the cat comes or goes. Usually cat hoarders want to keep things confined within their control. An outdoor colony is different than the homes where there are cat urine stains all over the walls or cat feces dripping out of cabinets. Weve seen some real doozies, he said. Robert Johns, a spokesman with the bird conservancy, said the law removes penalties for people who abandon animals to public places.  Instead of having a hoard of cats in a house, which is illegal in many places, we would simply have dozens or hundreds of them outdoors in many places, essentially taking over public land to be used by feral cats, he said. Our ruling The American Bird Conservancy said a bill would authorize the public hoarding of cats by feral cat activists. The bill would authorize people to neuter and release feral cats. But its difficult to predict how these future cat colonies will be managed and controlled by local ordinances. Is it possible that someone could hoard feral cats outdoors? Sure. But animal hoarders typically want to be able to control their cats, so thats why they hoard inside their own homes. The research we reviewed about feral cats focused on numbers, health problems and threats to wildlife they pose -- not whether it constitutes hoarding. That could be because hoarding isnt the central debate about these feral cats, but it is a heated word that draws attention.",0.5,0.5,1.0,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,1.0,0.5,half-true

Final Rating: Mostly False  ","The Obama administration ... would impose on every Catholic institution, every Jewish institution, every Protestant institution the Obamacare standard of what you have to buy as insurance.","Newt Gingrich, on the campaign trail before the Florida GOP primary, called out the Barack Obama administration for engaging in a war against religion.Federal officials' interpretation of the 2010 health care law violates religious freedom, he said.Their decision last week that they would impose on every Catholic institution, every Jewish institution, every Protestant institution the Obamacare standard of what you have to buy as insurance is a direct violation of freedom of religion, an example of the dictatorial attitude of this administration,he told voters in Jacksonville, Fla., on Jan. 30, 2012.What decision was he talking about? One about birth control. His campaign pointed us to criticism from theU.S. Conference of Catholic Bishopsof a Jan. 20 decision that ordered almost every employer and insurer in the country to provide sterilization and contraceptives, including some abortion-inducing drugs, in their health plans, according to the group.The bishops said almost every employer and insurer.We wondered, was Gingrich right that the Obama administration would impose on every Catholic institution, every Jewish institution, every Protestant institution the Obamacare standard of what you have to buy as insurance?'The Obamacare standard'The rule Gingrich was talking about, announced by Health and Human Services Department Secretary Kathleen Sebelius, addressed which preventive services must be covered by insurers without a co-pay, co-insurance or a deductible paid by the recipient of medical care.We should mention: There's not a clear Obamacare standard of what you have to buy as insurance. The law provides for co-pay-free preventive care, which is what Sebelius clarified Jan. 20. And for individual and small-group plans, the law requires that policies cover essential health benefits. They must include services in 10 categories, but the details have been left to the states.The idea of co-pay-free preventive care stems from studies that show that even moderate co-payskept women from getting care, such as mammograms or pap smears, according to HHS. The nongovernmentalInstitute of Medicinerecommended that preventive services include all FDA-approved forms of contraception. So that's what HHS decided to include in its final rule about preventive services.Most health insurance plans will have to cover them without a co-pay, co-insurance or a deductible. For most new and renewed health plans, that requirement kicks in Aug. 1, 2012. Religious exemptionsNotice we said that most health insurance plans will have to offer co-pay-free preventive care. The U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops said almost every employer and insurer.Gingrich said, every Catholic institution, every Jewish institution, every Protestant institution.But the rule provides an exemption for certain non-profit religious employersthat meet a four-part test-- essentially churches and synagogues, but also some primary and secondary religious schools.It's that definition of religious employer that has prompted theU.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, with the support of groups such as theUnion of Orthodox Jewish Congregations of America, to fight the rule. That's because it wouldn't cover religious organizations that don't primarily employ or serve people of the same religion — ruling out many universities, hospitals and charitable groups.That would require, say, a Catholic hospital to offer insurance coverage to its employees that included FDA-approved contraceptive drugs — which includes some drugs that Catholics consider abortion-inducing. Plan B and Ella prevent fertilization of an egg, prompting the FDA to categorize them as contraceptives rather than abortion-inducing drugs, but Catholics argue that Ellacan be used like the abortifacient RU-486, which isn't considered a contraceptive by the FDA.The government is giving such nonprofit religious groupsan extra yearto implement the preventive care requirements. But it won't exempt them.The decision already faceslegal challengesfrom Belmont Abbey College and Colorado Christian University.Still, if you consider a Catholic church to be a Catholic institution, or a synagogue to be a Jewish institution, Gingrich isn't correct that the recent federal rule on contraceptives applies. Those nonprofit religious employers could choose whether or not they covered contraceptive services.Our ruling Gingrich said that the Obama administration ... would impose on every Catholic institution, every Jewish institution, every Protestant institution the Obamacare standard of what you have to buy as insurance.He makes a broad statement in reference to a rule dealing specifically with co-pays for preventive care -- making it sound as though there's a blanket Obamacare standard for all insurance policies. The reality allows for states to set benchmarks for private individual and small-group plans.Meanwhile, he ignores an exemption in the federal rule for nonprofit religious employers such as churches and synagogues. That exemption has been condemned by Catholic bishops as too narrow and has been challenged in court. But it makes Gingrich's statement that the rule would impose on every ... institution inaccurate and misleading. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/dd0ecf5b-876e-4cfe-ac88-5c90949e8e9f",0.3,0.7,1.0,0.4,0.2,0.6,0.5,1.0,0.5,mostly-false

Final Rating: Mostly False","Van Jones is an avowed, self-avowed radical revolutionary communist.","Radio and TV political commentator Glenn Beck has spent weeks detailing what he says is a web of Obama administration officials with socialist or communist ties. And Exhibit A in the Beck argument has been Van Jones, Obama's so-called green jobs czar (his actual title was special adviser for green jobs at the Council on Environmental Quality). Conservative commentators and bloggers criticized Jones because of his past remarks and his involvement with controversial groups. His resignation was announced shortly after midnight on Sept. 6, 2009. Beck has repeatedly claimed Jones is a communist. For purposes of a fact-check statement, we selected a Sept. 1, 2009, remark Beck made on his radio program that Jones is an avowed, self-avowed radical revolutionary communist. There's little question that Jones  was  an avowed communist. In a Nov. 2, 2005, profile of Jones in the  East Bay Express  , an alternative weekly in Berkeley, Calif., Jones said his life hit a turning point in the spring of 1992 when he was swept up in mass arrests while protesting the acquittal of police officers accused of beating Rodney King. Although the charges against Jones were dropped, Jones said that while in jail, I met all these young radical people of color — I mean really radical, communists and anarchists. And it was, like, 'This is what I need to be a part of.' I spent the next 10 years of my life working with a lot of those people I met in jail, trying to be a revolutionary. In the months that followed, the  Express  article said, he let go of any lingering thoughts that he might fit in with the status quo. 'I was a rowdy nationalist on April 28th, and then the verdicts came down on April 29th,' he said. 'By August, I was a communist.' In 1994, the story states, Jones formed a socialist collective called Standing Together to Organize a Revolutionary Movement, or STORM. According to a history of STORM written in the spring of 2004, the group held structured political education training at every meeting to help members develop an understanding of the basics of Marxist politics. They trained members on capitalism and wage exploitation, the state and revolution, imperialism and the revolutionary party. So Jones was a self-avowed communist. But is he still? The answer lies in the very same article. Even before the group disbanded in 2002, the  Express  article says, Jones began transforming his politics and work... According to the article, He took an objective look at the movement's effectiveness and decided that the changes he was seeking were actually getting farther away. Not only did the left need to be more unified, he decided, it might also benefit from a fundamental shift in tactics. 'I realized that there are a lot of people who are capitalists — shudder, shudder — who are really committed to fairly significant change in the economy, and were having bigger impacts than me and a lot of my friends with our protest signs,' he said. In recent years, Jones established himself as a leading, charismatic cheerleader for transitioning the American economy to green jobs. We weren't able to find any recent interviews where Jones directly addresses the question of where he stands on communism. When he resigned this week, Jones said he was the victim of a vicious smear campaign by conservatives and decided to resign so as not to be a distraction. I cannot in good conscience ask my colleagues to expend precious time and energy defending or explaining my past, he said in a released statement. But check out these two statements and see if this sounds like a communist. This, from his book,  The Green Collar Economy  , released in October 2008: There will surely be an important role for nonprofit voluntary, cooperative, and community-based solutions, Jones writes on page 86. But the reality is that we are entering an era during which our very survival will demand invention and innovation on a scale never before seen in the history of human civilization. Only the business community has the requisite skills, experience, and capital to meet that need. On that score, neither the government nor the nonprofit and voluntary sectors can compete, not even remotely. So in the end, our success and survival as a species are largely and directly tied to the new eco-entrepreneurs — and the success and survival of their enterprises. Since almost all of the needed eco-technologies are likely to come from the private sector, civic leaders and voters should do all that can be done to help green business leaders succeed. That means, in large part, electing leaders who will pass bills to aid them. We cannot realistically proceed without a strong alliance between the best of the business world — and everyone else. Or how about this, from an address before the Center for American Progress on Nov. 19, 2008 (well before Jones was brought into the Obama administration): Everything that is good for the environment, everything that's needed to beat global warming, is a job, Jones said. Solar panels don't manufacture themselves. Wind turbines don't manufacture themselves. Homes don't weatherize themselves. Every single thing that we need to beat global warming will also beat the recession. And the challenge is, how do we get the government to be a smart, and limited, catalyst in getting the private sector to take on this challenge? That doesn't sound Marxist to us. Beck would have been on solid ground if he said Jones  used to be  a communist. Jones has been up front about that. But Beck has repeatedly said Jones  is  a communist. Present tense. Although we could not find a comment in which Jones explicitly said why he is no longer one, we found ample evidence that he now believes capitalism is the best force for the social change he is seeking. So there's truth to Beck's claim in that Jones  was  a communist, but it's apparent he isn't any longer, as Beck suggests. So we find the claim Barely True.  Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False. ",0.5,0.7,0.9,0.6,0.4,0.6,0.5,0.8,0.5,mostly-false

Final Rating: Mostly False",The new tax law iskicking the American economy into high gear with $5.5 trillion in tax cuts.,"In its 1600 Daily email to supporters and members of the public, the White House touted the tax bill that President Donald Trump signed in late December as a highlight of 2017. The email said that the new law would be kicking the American economy into high gear with $5.5 trillion in tax cuts, 1.7 million new jobs, and more than 60 record highs for the Dow Jones index. Heres a screenshot: That $5.5 trillion figure caught the eye of a reader, who wrote PolitiFact to note that the figure most frequently applied to the bill in news accounts is $1.5 trillion. So whats going on? When we checked into it, we found that $5.5 trillion is a misleading number because it only focuses on one side of the ledger. The law does include roughly $5.5 trillion in tax cuts over the next 10 years, which is the standard time frame for studying bills of this sort. (This just measures the cuts themselves without taking into account any possible economic growth spurred by the cuts.) However, the law also includes roughly $4 trillion in tax increases. When you add the two numbers together, the net change is roughly $1.5 trillion. So the White House is enjoying its dessert (the tax cuts) while ignoring the vegetables (the tax hikes). That provides a skewed version of the bills, tax policy experts say. Patrick Newton, a spokesman for the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, said that the $5.5 trillion figure is misleading if its the only one cited. If one figure was going to be cited, it should be the net cost of the bill — $1.5 trillion. He noted, however, that the White House did use a more accurate formulation in a more detailed web page dated Dec. 21, 2017, that explains the bills provisions. On that web page, the White House wrote that the bill provides $5.5 trillion in tax cuts but that it will also raise $4 trillion in revenue to help offset tax cuts. Our ruling Trump said the recently enacted tax law includes $5.5 trillion in tax cuts. Putting it that way ignores that the bill also includes $4 trillion in tax increases, for a net of $1.5 trillion in tax cuts.",0.5,0.7,1.0,0.4,0.3,0.6,0.5,1.0,0.6,mostly-false

Final Rating: Mostly False  ","We have towns in West Texas that are out of water, that are having to truck in water.","At a March 2015 symposium on water in Texas, the states agriculture commissioner was asked about his agencys actions in that realm. Sid Miller, a former legislator who took office in January 2015, replied that just that week hed signed off on water wells being drilled in two West Texas communities with less than 180-day water supplies. Miller, a Republican, continued: We have towns in West Texas that are out of water, that are having to truck in water. We were familiar with occasional past shortages. But is that happening again? When we requested Millers backup information, Agriculture Department spokesman Bryan Black sent us web links to news reports. One was a January 2012 NPR news report on Spicewood Beach, a Burnet County town northwest of Austin, having to truck in water. Then again, conditions there were expected to rebound, according to a June 2013 Austin American-Statesman news story, thanks to new water wells drilled near Lake Travis and a new water treatment plant. Black also pointed out a June 2013 Texas Tribune news story on the West Texas town of Barnhart, which was then out of water. To gauge Barnharts conditions of late, we reached John Nanny, an Irion County commissioner who serves on the board of the Barnhart Water Supply Corp. By phone, Nanny said drinking water last had to be trucked in during July and August 2014 — at quite a cost, he said. We cant afford to do that, he said, adding that a second well was dug, helping to shore up supplies to about 50 customers. Black didnt specify communities that had no water when Miller, um, piped up. Texas Commission on Environmental Quality Next, we reached out to the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality. By email, spokesman Terry Clawson said that as of March 12, 2015, the agency wasnt aware of any public water systems hauling in water. That said, Clawson wrote, the Berry Oaks Water Company in Comal County, between Austin and San Antonio, intermittently hauls water because of summer shortfalls. Clawson emailed us a chart indicating the water system is building a well and water plant, to be up and running, Clawson said, by mid-May 2015. Clawson said the chart represents the agencys weekly updated High Priority Water System List, which reflects water-supply conditions self-reported to the commission — meaning it shouldnt be read as all-inclusive. There may be systems that have either not reported their status or are not aware of their conditions, Clawson said. In a follow-up note, Clawson specified 11 public water systems previously reported as having to haul (or truck) in drinking water due to persistent drought. He attached a chart describing each instance. In another email, Black mentioned most of the same systems. The commission chart listed five water systems located somewhere on the vast west side of Texas, specifically ones in Burnet County, northwest of Austin; Barnhart in Irion County, west of San Angelo; Medina County, west of San Antonio; Hood County, southwest of Fort Worth; and Tom Green County, whose county seat is San Angelo. Then again, in each event, according to the chart, the Texas Department of Agriculture or the water system itself funded improvements restoring supply. Our ruling Miller said: We have towns in West Texas that are out of water. In recent years, towns around Texas occasionally ran dry until new wells or water plants met needs. But Miller named no towns out of water of late nor did we identify any. MOSTLY FALSE – The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.

Final Rating: Mostly False  ","By voting for Obamacare, Sen. Kay Hagan voted to kill the equivalent of 2.5 million jobs.","In the second North Carolina Senate debate between Democratic incumbent Kay Hagan and Republican Thom Tillis, the challenger reached deep into the GOP playbook for an attack line about President Barack Obamas health care law and its potential impact on jobs. Sen. Hagans solution is spending more money, Tillis said. Its very simple. Government needs to get out of the way. We need to get our spending under control, and we need to reduce regulations. Sen. Hagan, when she cast the deciding vote for Obamacare, voted to kill the equivalent of 2.5 million jobs. Critics of the health care law have long argued that the new regulations it created, particularly those on businesses, would hamper employment -- or, in the more explosive language of the campaign trail, that it would be a job killer. The critics got what seemed to be a boost when the Congressional Budget Office -- Congress nonpartisan numbers-cruncher -- produced a report on this topic in February 2014. The CBO projected that by 2017, there would be the equivalent of about 2 million fewer workers than there would be in the absence of the law. CBO said that number would grow to about 2.5 million by 2024. However, most of the laws critics glossed over some critical facts when citing these numbers. Why kill is the wrong word The biggest problem with Tillis characterization of the CBOs findings is that he used the word kill. This is inaccurate because it suggests that employers will be making 2.5 million layoffs, or because businesses arent going to be creating that many jobs. That's not what the report said; rather, the reduction will come primarily from voluntary choices by workers, not by employers. The CBO figured that, when presented with new options for purchasing health insurance outside their job, millions of people would decide they dont need to work as much. The report estimated that Obamacare would reduce the total number of hours worked, on net, by about 1.5 percent to 2.0 percent during the period from 2017 to 2024, almost entirely because workers will choose to supply less labor -- given the new taxes and other incentives they will face and the financial benefits some will receive. This would equal a decline in the number of full-time-equivalent workers of about 2 million in 2017, rising to about 2.5 million in 2024, it continued. These changes, CBO said, would not result in an increase in unemployment (that is, more workers seeking but not finding jobs) or underemployment (such as part-time workers who would prefer to work more hours per week). To be clear, the report predicts that total employment will still rise. It just wont rise as much as it would if the health care law did not exist. We should note that the report did have some less sanguine observations about the health care laws impact on employment. As more people choose to work less, the CBO concluded, the labor force participation rate should decline, putting a larger burden for supporting the social safety net on those who remain working. Any change in labor force participation comes on top of an already major shift toward retirement driven by the aging of the baby boom. In addition, some commentators have expressed concern about having people work less because taxpayer-subsidized insurance is available. Ultimately, it boils down to a tradeoff, Tara Sinclair, a George Washington University economist, told PolitiFact earlier this year. Admittedly there are some touchy issues with the government potentially paying or subsidizing the health care costs for people who could work but choose not to, Sinclair said. But overall I think separating health care from employment, at least making it like any other service where employment may provide the money to pay for it but where we work doesn't determine our choices, is a good thing. To his credit, Tillis -- unlike many of his Republican colleagues -- was able to avoid one linguistic pitfall. Tillis framed the CBOs findings as projecting a reduction in the equivalent of 2.5 million jobs, rather than simply saying a reduction of 2.5 million jobs. Thats an important distinction because the CBO didnt cite the number of jobs that will be reduced; rather, it referred to full-time-equivalents of jobs. That may seem deep in the weeds, but its worth noting. These job equivalents will be made up of lots of bits and pieces of hours per week that people will choose to drop. For instance, some of these people might be working two or three jobs, in excess of 40 hours a week, and will choose to cut back to a more reasonable one or two jobs. A final note: Were also not wild about Tillis characterization of Hagan casting the deciding vote for Obamacare. In most cases when weve looked at that claim, we have rated them Mostly False, since any one of the 60 Senate supporters could have been described as having cast the deciding vote. But for the sake of simplicity, we will only consider the employment question in putting this claim to the Truth-O-Meter. Our ruling In the debate, Tillis said that, by voting for Obamacare, Sen. Kay Hagan voted to kill the equivalent of 2.5 million jobs. The main problem with this claim is that Tillis used the word kill. This mischaracterizes what is going on, since the reduction will come from voluntary actions by workers, rather than layoffs by employers. Indeed, the CBO said the law would not push up unemployment.",0.5,0.8,1.0,0.6,0.4,0.7,0.5,1.0,0.3,mostly-false

Final Rating: Mostly False  ",Says U.S. Senate candidate Eric Hovde has no problem with raising taxes.,"Trying to boost Republican Mark Neumanns bid for U.S. Senate, a national conservative group is blasting away at Neumann rivals Tommy Thompson and Eric Hovde.The message: Both are big taxers.The national Club for Growth, which has endorsed Neumann, uses a widely aired TV ad to highlight nine instances of tax increases during Tommy Thompsons 14 years as Wisconsin governor -- years marked, as we found in rating a Thompson claim Mostly True, by a decline in the overall tax burden.The group had a much smaller record to comb through on Hovde, a banker and investment-fund manager and first-time candidate.In a national TV interview, Hovde said he had no problem with raising taxes, the ad says. And Hovde supported tax-raising Gov. Jim Doyle. On taxes, Hovdes like Thompson, only worse.The ad shows a smiling Hovde at the start of a 2009 TV appearance as a financial pundit on CNBCs Squawk Box beneath the words: No Problem Raising Taxes.Hovde fired back with his own TV spot that calls the Neumann (actually Club for Growths) tax accusation false. (The campaign acknowledges Hovde gave $500 to Democrat Doyles re-election campaign in 2005. It has not explained why, but notes that Hovde has given almost exclusively to Republicans, and in much larger amounts.)So, did Hovdes remarks suggest he has no problem with raising taxes?We watched the nearly 11-minute discussion between Hovde and the cable shows hosts and found a brief exchange on taxes that closely -- but not exactly -- mirrors the language in the groups ad.The backgroundHovdes March 3, 2009 appearance on CNBC focused on the ongoing financial crisis and his criticisms of actions under both Republican President George W. Bush and newly elected President Barack Obama. Hovde said the country was in a depression, Obamas stimulus bill was unfocused and out of control federal spending was taking the country into quasi-Socialist territory.At the 7:25 mark of the segment, as the Journal Sentinels Dan Bice reported in April 2012, Hovde abruptly turned the talk to taxes, tax breaks and the Obama administration.Unprompted, he began: Look, I have no problem with me getting charged higher taxes. Ive been blessed in my life and Ive been very fortunate. But some of the things that theyve done are just insane.Then he referred to an Obama 2009 proposal to reduce the mortgage-interest tax deduction for households earning more than $250,000.Taking away deductions on home mortgage payments -- I dont need it, but a lot of other people do. Hovde said. Were in a housing recession -- are you kidding me?So, the Club for Growth claims Hovde said he had no problem with raising taxes. He actually said: I have no problem with me getting charged higher taxes.Thats a significant difference, especially since he immediately noted that eliminating housing deductions, for instance, would be unwise in a recession.The timing is also important.In 2009, Hovde was a private citizen, not a candidate running on a platform of what he would do if elected.An candidate can have a personal opinion on an issue but may decide to vote another way for a variety of reasons. For instance, a lawmaker personally would not seek an abortion but votes pro-choice to leave the decision up to the mother.Its also unclear from the 2009 CNBC interview exactly what Hovde was talking about. Did he mean paying more through a higher top tax rate? Through a repeal of the Bush tax cuts?When asked about the claim, the Club for Growth noted it would take a tax increase of some kind for Hovdes personal tax bill to rise.As a candidate in 2012, Hovde told Bice he was not referring to Obamas so-called Buffett Rule legislation to make sure high earners pay at least 30 percent in federal income tax (a bill sponsored by U.S. Rep. Tammy Baldwin, the Democratic candidate in the race).Hovde has said he was thinking of the tax break on carried interest -- the portion of a funds investment gains taken by fund managers (like Hovde) as compensation. It also applies to venture capitalists and private equity specialists.In an interview, Hovde agreed that it would be a tax increase for that narrow group. Some government estimates put the total at more than $1 billion a year.But lets look at his tax positions as a candidate in 2012.Hovde has pledged to reduce individual income tax rates across the board, drop the corporate income tax rate from 35 percent to 25 percent and eliminate the estate tax.So Hovde has made it clear he is against raising tax rates. In fact, he wants dramatic cuts in peoples tax bills.That leaves his support for eliminating tax deductions -- a move that would bring the government more revenue.Hovde says he would vote to eliminate nearly all of the deductions in the current tax code, which he sees as riddled with favors to big corporations at the expense of small businesses. He also thinks the individual tax code is too complicated.And he told us he still favors eliminating the carried interest tax provision, which he sees as eliminating a loophole.Hovde, who has made debt and deficit reduction a major theme, has told voters he would accept a budget-balancing deal that gets $10 in spending cuts for every $1 in new revenue through the elimination of loopholes or deductions.He told us his strong preference would be that such a deal include cuts in the tax rates.He said he would consider supporting a 10-to-1 deal that holds rates steady instead of lowering them, depending on which loopholes or deductions are removed.But does that constitute a tax increase?Even conservative Republicans disagree on this. Americans for Tax Reforms widely publicized taxpayer protection pledge frowns on deduction eliminations unless the new revenue is completely offset by lower rates. Thompson and Neumann have signed that pledge, but Hovde has not. A leading conservative in the Senate, Republican Tom Coburn of Oklahoma, has criticized the groups pledge as too narrow to allow for smart reform of the tax code.PolitiFact National consulted a range of experts in January 2012 in evaluating a Mitt Romney claim that Obama has raised taxes 19 times.Views differed on some issues, but the consensus was that eliminating or limiting such deductions as those for prescription or other medical expenses clearly deserved the label of tax increases.Donald Marron, director of the Tax Policy Center, told us its case by case -- some of these tax preferences are best seen as taxes, but others as spending programs in disguise.Given Hovdes pledge to wipe out nearly all deductions, it seems clear that some of those moves could be labeled as tax increases. Even Hovde acknowledged eliminating the carried interest provision would be a tax increase for a narrow group.Our conclusionThe national Club for Growth used Hovdes own words from a cable TV interview in 2009 to frame him as in favor of raising taxes.Hovde said what he said -- he would pay more, which put him on record as open to some kind of tax increase. Theres no other way to read it.But the ad takes the 2009 comment and alters it in a subtle but significant way, changing the context. By also changing the timing, leaving viewers thinking Hovde is campaigning in 2012 on a plan to raise taxes, the issue is further distorted.In the current campaign, Hovde has made it clear he wants dramatically lower taxes and would not raise rates, while staying open to a net revenue increase from loophole elimination as part of a massive spending-and-tax-cut deal. That doesnt square with the breezy portrayal of Hovde as having no problem raising taxes.The Truth-O-Meter says Mostly False claims have an element of truth but ignore critical facts that would give a different impression.We think that fits the Club for Growth ad claim.

Final Rating: Mostly False  ",The director of the FBI said that we cannot properly vet people coming from the Middle East.,"Bradenton developer Carlos Beruff wants voters to know that he plans to be tough on national security and immigration, because right now the FBI has no way to guarantee Americas safety as refugees flood the United States. Thousands of Syrian refugees are pouring into our country, thanks to President Obama, Beruff said in an Aug. 8 Facebook post. This is an open invitation to acts of terror. Even the director of the FBI said that we cannot properly vet people coming from the Middle East. Immigration has been a major focus of this election cycle, with Republicans routinely calling for more restrictions to ensure security in the United States. But did James Comey actually say the FBI cannot properly vet people coming from the Middle East? No, he didnt. Beruff is distorting a point Comey was making about a flaw in the vetting process, but he was reiterating the system in place was actually much better than it had been in years past. No guarantees When we asked Beruffs campaign what Comey said and when, his spokesman sent us a YouTube clip of Comey speaking before the House Homeland Security Committee on Oct. 21, 2015. A topic at the meeting was the thoroughness of background checks for refugees — specifically some 10,000 Syrian refugees slated to come to the United States. The Syrian refugee focus was much more specific than people coming from the Middle East, as Beruff said. Lets be clear: The United States can vet refugees through a process that involves the FBI, plus the State Department, the Department of Homeland Security, the Department of Defense and other agencies. The vetting process can take two or even three years, in which refugees undergo several rounds of security clearance checks. Because of the overt concern about terrorism, Syrian refugees actually have to go through extra hurdles. Experts have told us repeatedly that refugee background checks are the most extensive security screening the country has for any type of visitor. At the committee meeting, U.S. Rep. Bennie Thompson, D-Miss., asked Comey if there was concern that the FBI could miss a potential terrorist infiltrator because intelligence databases may not contain complete information on every refugee. Comey agreed, saying the procedure isnt perfect, because it relies on checking for criminal records or other nefarious activity. We can only query against that which we have collected, Comey said. If someone has never made a ripple in the pond in Syria in a way that would get their identity or their interest reflected in our database, we can query our database until the cows come home but we are not going to — there will be nothing show up because we have no record on that person. So while the process is very thorough, Comey was saying he couldnt guarantee there would never be a problem and no terrorist could ever slip through the cracks. Thats just the way it is. Comey noted that when the United States performed background checks on Iraqi refugees, they had a much larger database because of the American presence there over the last decade. Not having the same intelligence infrastructure in Syria has resulted in much less information with which to cross-reference an applicant. As Secretary of Homeland Security,Jeh Johnson said during the same hearing that a refugee may have a criminal past thats unknown, or may suddenly commit a terrorist act after entering the United States. But even with the pitfalls of admitting refugees from war-torn regions, Comey said, the process works and has been improving over the years. The good news is we are much better doing it than eight years ago, Comey told U.S. Rep Jeff Duncan, R-S.C., later in the hearing. The bad news is, there is no risk-free process. Comey was echoing concerns he voiced to the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee on Oct. 8. There is risk associated with bringing anybody in from the outside, but especially from a conflict zone like that, he told the Senate committee. From the intelligence community's perspective, as I said, I think we've developed an effective way to touch all of our databases and resources to figure out what we know about individuals.  I don't think that's a cumbersome process. My concern there is that there are certain gaps. He repeated that sentiment to the House Judiciary Committee on Oct. 22. We have gotten much better as an intelligence community at joining our efforts and checking our databases in a way that gives us high confidence. If we have a record on somebody, it will surface. That's the good news, Comey said. The challenge we face with Syria is that we don't have that rich set of data. So even though we've gotten better at querying what we have, we certainly will have less overall. And so as I said to a question earlier, someone only alerts as a result of our searches if we have some record on them. That's the challenge we face with Syria. Our ruling Beruff said, The director of the FBI said that we cannot properly vet people coming from the Middle East. Comey, while talking specifically about Syrian refugees and not all of the Middle East, has repeatedly said that admitting refugees has its challenges and that information gaps do exist. But he also has expressed confidence in the admission procedure and says it continues to improve. That makes it hard to argue Comey feels like the governments process cannot properly vet people.",0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,mostly-false

Final Rating: Mostly False",There was just about zero press coverage of the 2007 Bush White House email controversy.,"Why is everyone picking on Hillary Clinton -- they didnt mind when President George W. Bushs White House also used private email, pundit Juan Williams asked on Fox News Sunday. The shows March 15, 2015, pundit panel debated the importance of the ongoing controversy regarding Clintons decision to exclusively use a private email account, rather than a .gov account, during her time as secretary of state. In doing so, experts say she was able to circumvent transparency and records preservation standards. Williams turned to his fellow commentator, Republican strategist and former Bush adviser Karl Rove, arguing that the email scandal during the Bush administration didnt garner the same level of media criticism. Thus, the attention on Clinton is unwarranted. When Karl was in trouble back in 07, (there was) no press coverage, just about zero press coverage of this issue, Williams said, noting that he found just one Washington Post editorial criticizing the private email use. Juan, you are in a different reality, and I wish that I was there with you, Rove said. We decided to look back and see what press coverage of the Bush administration email controversy looked like at the timeand how it compares to coverage of Clinton. The Bush email story First, a quick refresher about what happened in the Bush administration. In March 2007, eyes were on then-Attorney General Alberto Gonzales after the administration unexpectedly fired eight U.S.attorneys. Congress (recently taken over by Democrats) investigated the firings, alleging that the administration had dropped the prosecutors for political reasons. Over the course of the investigation, it came out that some White House officials had conducted White House business over private email accountsset up on a server through the Republican National Committee. The White House later admitted that some internal White House emails conducted on the RNC server might have been lost. Democrats in Congress accused the administration of purposefully circumventing recordkeeping processes, while the White House said staffers were supposed to use the RNC emails solely for political affairs, not official business. Comparing the Bush and Clinton email scandals is not exactly apples to apples, but there are some similarities. We looked back at media coverage at the time, and Williams has a point that it didnt cause the same level of hubbub as the Clinton email scandal. Though to say there was zero press coverage is an exaggeration -- even allowing for a bit of hyperbole. Comparing the coverage We did a search through Lexis-Nexis, a research service that tracks news articles and transcripts, between March and May 2007. We found more than 125 transcripts from the major cable networks and National Public Radio that include Republican National Committee and email within 10 words of each other. The Lexis-Nexis search also yielded more than 200 related newspaper articles across the country within the same time frame. Lets compare that to coverage of the Clinton controversy. Since the story broke March 3, 2015 -- two weeks ago -- we found 204 cable and public radio transcripts that include Clinton and email. We also found 1,700 newspaper articles across the country. Thats several times as many articles and transcripts about Clinton than there were about the Bush email controversy in a quarter of the time. Its a rough measurement, but clearly there has been more media attention on Clintons use of private email than that of the White House staffers. What about Williams reference to the singular Washington Post editorial criticizing the private email use among White House staffers? We found the one editorial, as well as a couple opinion columns. In comparison, the Washington Post has so far written two editorials regarding Clintons private email use. Not the same Williams argument is that Republicans are stoking the media fire of the Clinton email scandal because theyre worried about Clintons 2016 potential, compared to Republican candidates. Theres some nuances and contextual factors that might explain the difference in media coverage. First of all, theres the difference in whos at the receiving end of the criticisms. In 2007, it was a group of higher-up White House staffers and advisers (notably Rove) who occasionally used private email accounts for official business. As far as we can tell, though, Bush himself was not suspected as being part of this group. Today, the target is a former secretary of state, who only used private email when conducting official government business. Whats more is that Clinton is in all likelihood running for president in 2016, so she has a lot of media attention on her to begin with. At the time of their email controversy, the Bush administration was past their 2004 second-term election and the 2006 midterms. Additionally, the White House email controversy was on the periphery of a much larger scandal -- the firings of the eight U.S. attorneys. We searched Lexis-Nexis for articles about Attorney General Gonzales in the same time frame that we used to explore coverage of the White House email controversy. The search came up with more than 6,000 combined newspaper articles and transcripts. (Compared to the more than 325 about the emails). As oneWashington Post article put it: The controversy over the outside e-mail accounts is a byproduct of the ongoing showdown over the prosecutor firings. Our ruling Williams said there was just about zero press coverage of the 2007 Bush White House email controversy. We emailed Williams and did not hear back. Saying there was zero press coverage is an exaggeration --even allowing for a bit of hyperbole. We found hundreds of articles and television transcripts referencing the issue. Still, Williams has something of a point that compared to the extensive recent coverage of Clintons use of private email, media coverage of the 2007 Bush White House email controversy was thin. Williams statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.",0.2,0.7,0.8,0.3,0.2,0.5,0.4,0.9,0.5,mostly-false

Final Rating: Mostly False  ",Says U.S. greenhouse gas emissions are at 20-year lows.,"As President Barack Obama brought up his interest in addressing global warming, a Texas congressman said U.S. emissions of greenhouse gases, widely believed to be fueling climate change, are on the decline.  DID YOU KNOW? Rep. Joe Barton, R-Arlington, wrote on Twitter during Obamas Feb. 12, 2013, State of the Union address. U.S. GHG emissions are at 20-year lows while global emissions are rising.   Global emissions have been on the upswing. The Environmental Protection Agency says on a web page that global carbon emissions from the burning of fossil fuels increased by over 16 times between 1900 and 2008 and by about 1.5 times between 1990 and 2008. Separately, the governments Carbon Dioxide Information Analysis Center contributed to a December 2012 discussion paper stating that in 2011, estimated global carbon dioxide emissions due to burning fossil fuels and making cement were up 3 percent from 2010.   We checked on Bartons claim that domestic greenhouse gas emissions are at a 20-year low.   By email, Barton spokesman Sean Brown pointed out an August 2012 web post by the U.S. Energy Information Administration stating that estimated U.S. carbon dioxide emissions resulting from energy use during the first three months of 2012 were the lowest in two decades for any January-March period. Brown also noted the Environmental Protection Agency saying in an online chart that as of 2010, concentrations of five common air pollutants--carbon monoxide, ozone, lead, nitrogen dioxide and sulfur dioxide--had decreased from 30 years earlier.   This information did not speak to all greenhouse gases, as Barton had, but carbon dioxide from burning fossil fuels is the largest contributor to greenhouse gas emissions.   Perry Lindstrom, an economist with the Energy Information Administration, emailed us a spreadsheet indicating that the nations energy-related carbon dioxide emissions were estimated at 1,339 million metric tons in the first quarter of 1992 and at a slightly higher amount, 1,344 million metric tons, for the comparable months of 2012. In the intervening years, first-quarter emissions topped out at 1,580 million metric tons in 2004 and bottomed out at 1,364 million metric tons in 1993, according to the spreadsheet.   Then again, the first quarter of 2012 was unusual, the agency said in its post. Normally, the agency wrote, carbon dioxide emissions during the year are highest in the first quarter because of strong demand for heat produced by fossil fuels. But such emissions were lower at the start of 2012 thanks to a mild winter, which reduced heating demand and energy use, the agency said, with other factors including a decline in coal-fired electricity generation, due largely to low natural gas prices, and reduced gasoline demand.   Still, the 2012 first-quarter emissions were lower than they had been in the first part of the year in 19 years. However, Lindstrom said by telephone, he would hesitate to reach conclusions solely by comparing emissions in part of a year to emissions in part of another year in contrast to looking, say, decade to decade. At our request, he provided a spreadsheet comparing energy-related carbon dioxide emissions for the 10 months through October 2012 to such emissions over the comparable part of each previous year over two decades. Our thinking was that this would deliver a longer view based on the latest information available when Barton tweeted. And according to this spreadsheet, the estimated emissions from January through October 2012, 4,386 metric tons, were the lowest 10-month total since 1995--17 years earlier--when such emissions totaled 4,385 metric tons.   Going forward, Lindstrom pointed out, his agency projects U.S. energy-related carbon dioxide emissions to remain below 2005 levels through 2040. Jim Butler, director of global monitoring at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administrations Earth System Research Laboratory, said by phone that such levelling out makes sense due to improvements in energy efficiency and shifts to fuel sources with less of a carbon footprint than coal.   Mindful that Bartons tweet said greenhouse gas emissions were at a 20-year low, we looked next at emissions of methane, nitrous dioxide, sulfur dioxide, hydrofluorocarbons, perfluorocarbons and sulfur hexafluoride as estimated in the Environmental Protection Agencys April 2012 inventory of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions--the latest inventory that would have been available when Barton tweeted. (The agencys 2013 draft inventory was posted online Feb. 22, 2013.)   The 2012 inventory indicates that total emissions of three gases were higher in 2010 than 1990, while emissions of four others were lower.   In keeping with Bartons 20-year window, we used the inventory figures to gauge the difference between estimated emissions of each greenhouse gas in 2010 and 1990:   --Carbon dioxide emissions in 2010 were 12 percent greater than in 1990;  --Methane emissions were lower by 0.3 percent; --Nitrous oxide emissions were lower by 3 percent; --Hydrofluorocarbon emissions were higher by more than 200 percent; --Perfluorocarbons were lower by 73 percent; --Sulfur hexafluoride emissions were lower by 57 percent.  Taking all the greenhouse gases into account, according to the inventory, overall emissions were 11 percent higher in 2010 than 1990--and also up 3 percent from 2009, when total emissions dipped considerably during the national recession. Aside from 2009, the previous year with lower greenhouse gas emissions than 2010 was 1997, according to the inventory.   Our ruling   The congressman said domestic greenhouse gas emissions are at a 20-year low.   This statement depends on a comparison of energy-related carbon dioxide emissions—not all greenhouse gases--over three unusually warm winter months of 2012 to such emissions in the same months of 1992. But the latest information available when Barton tweeted indicates that total U.S. greenhouse gas emissions were higher in 2010 than they were 20 years earlier, though the 2010 emissions were lower than they were 13 years earlier.   CORRECTION, 10:42 a.m. April 8, 2013: Thanks to a reader's nudge, this story was amended to say that the discussed levels of carbon dioxide were in millions of metric tons, not metric tons alone.

Final Rating: Mostly False  ","Says Bill Nelson sold agricultural land for home development, pocketing at least $1.4 million.","A hokey political commercialfrom the conservative super PAC American Crossroads lambasts Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson as a politician who has gotten out of paying property taxes.After 40 years in politics, Bill Nelson has learned how to milk the system. He leased land that he owned for six cows, taking advantage of an agricultural tax loophole to dodge $43,000 in taxes just last year, the narrator says. Then he sold the land for home development, pocketing at least $1.4 million.The kicker: Tax breaks and big profits for him, higher taxes for the rest of us. Here, we will look at whether he sold the land for home development for at least $1.4 million.The greenbelt exemptionAs evidence for the ad, Crossroads spokesman Nate Hodson referred us to a February 2012 Tampa Bay Timesstory that scrutinized Nelsons qualifications for a greenbelt assessment, which spares him from paying higher taxes on his familys 55-acre pasture along the Indian River. Instead of paying taxes on the market value, his tax bill is based on a much lower agricultural assessment.Nelson gets the greenbelt assessment for his Brevard County pasture because he leases the land to a small-time cattle owner. The current lessee, cattleman Jeff Darby, has a herd of about six cows and uses the land free of charge, though he is tasked with maintenance.The greenbelt law was enacted in 1959 as a financial incentive for farmers to keep their land as developers bought up farm land for malls, highways and homes.Without the lower agricultural rate, Nelson would have paid about $43,000 in higher taxes on the land.The ad gives voters the impression that Nelson parked some cows on land to save money on his taxes and then axed the cows in a land sale to developers. (The ad sends the cows flying with the arrival of a new brick house from the sky.)Such a move obviously goes against the spirit of the greenbelt law, though its legal, and it happens. The problem with the greenbelt law, critics say, is that its written too broadly. Under the law, county property appraisers are tasked with determining if the land is used primarily for bona fide agricultural purposes.The Brevard County property appraisers office has tried to remove Nelsons greenbelt designation in the past, but Nelson fought to keep it and won in court. (An inspector in 1999 went to his property and found no cows; Nelson argued they escaped via a hole in the fence.)Nelsons land salesThe ad leaves out a lot of important context about that $1.4 million profit that Nelson supposedly gained from land sales.When Nelson moved to Tallahassee in the mid 90s to serve on the state Cabinet, he sold the main house that he lived in, which is adjacent to the pasture.He sold four more nearby lots after he moved to Washington, D.C., to serve as a U.S. senator. Two of these were residential lots that had houses on them. Two more were lots that he cut out of his pastureland, so those had used the greenbelt exemption. The total for these four transactions to private homeowners is at least $1.4 million, the Times reported. Floridas greenbelt law does not require him to pay back part of his tax break.Nelsons campaign does not dispute the $1.4 million total -- they do dispute how American Crossroads presented the transactions. That total does not represent all of the money he received from the agricultural lots; it also includes the sales of two residential lots.The ad is leading viewers to equate the land that got the tax break with the land he sold for $1.4 million, and thats plainly wrong. Nelson did not sell the entire pasture. The cows still graze on it, and Nelson has indicated that will not change for the land his family has had since 1924.I've looked at all the options on the rest of the property and I've decided not to develop it. I want to leave it to my kids, Nelson told the Times in February.Our rulingIts not fully accurate for Crossroads to say Nelson took land that was receiving agricultural tax breaks and sold it for home development at a profit of $1.4 million. For one, the land that earned the tax break -- a 55-acre pasture -- is still a pasture. He did not sell that land for home development.Nelson has sold two agricultural lots, but those sales do not total $1.4 million. To get there, you have to factor in two more sales of residential lots adjoining the pasture. Those lots already had homes on them when Nelson sold them.American Crossroads is cherry-picking a figure from the Times story to incite anger against Nelsons tax break without telling the entire story.",0.2,0.8,0.9,0.5,0.3,0.7,0.6,0.9,0.4,mostly-false

Final Rating: Mostly False  ","Says Joe Biden said voting by mail is a way to fundamentally change this country, contradicting past statements by Barack Obama and Debbie Wasserman Schultz.","A new video launched by the Republican National Committee suggests Democrats are pushing a radical plan to change our elections through widespread mail-in voting. This is a radical change from their past, the video says. As evidence, it flashes to clips of comments by President Barack Obama, U.S. Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, D-Fla., and former U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder that are divorced from any context. The one-minute video plays snippets of journalists bashing Iowa Democrats over their bungled caucus in February before ending with a warning: Democrats couldnt run the Iowa Caucus. Dont let them redesign our entire election. The RNC launched its Protect the Vote website May 8, vowing to fight the Democrats assault on the integrity of our elections. But the clips of Democratic leaders are removed from the context of what they were talking about and ignore Obamas support for voting by mail in general at the time. The video also wrongly portrays the push for more mail-in voting as solely a Democratic effort. While Democratic leaders have pushed for more mail-in voting, they arent alone. Republican officeholders in at least 16 states that do not have all-mail elections were encouraging voters to cast ballots via mail. The RNCs former chairman in March called for conservatives to embrace broader use of voting by mail. RELATED: Donald Trumps dubious claim that 'thousands' are conspiring on mail-ballot fraud The ad starts with a clip of presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden stating, We have an incredible opportunity to not just dig out of this crisis but to fundamentally change this country. The text on the screen says, Democrats have a radical plan to change our elections. But Bidens statement was about protecting essential workers, not voting by mail or in person. He used a May 4 campaign event to talk about providing a livable wage and paid sick leave to workers including meat packers and grocery store clerks. Bidens campaign has said he wants safer options for voting, including voting by mail and in-person voting. At a virtual fundraiser in April, Biden told donors that we have to make it easier for everyone to vote if we are still in lockdown, including providing mail-in ballots. At a virtual fundraiser May 8, Biden praised a move by California Gov. Gavin Newsom to send a mail-in ballot to every voter. The video shows MSNBCs Chris Matthews asking Obama a question related to mail-in voting. They are talking about people mailing in their ballots. Do you trust the security, the honesty of such an election process? Matthews asked. Obama responded: Well, Id think we would have to figure out whether this was fraud-proof. The video doesnt clearly show the context of the interview; faint text on the screen says Decision 08. It would be possible for viewers to assume Obama was criticizing voting by mail in general, but Obama was commenting about a specific set of circumstances related to the presidential primary in Florida. In 2007, the Florida Legislature moved up the date of the presidential primary to Jan. 29, earlier than either national party permitted. Hillary Clinton beat Obama, but the Democratic National Committee determined that the election violated party rules and stripped the state of its delegates. In March 2008, some Florida Democrats proposed a do-over election including a scenario of entirely voting by mail. Here was Matthews full question on March 11, 2008, to then-Sen. Obama: Theres word from Florida that they intend to put out a mailing sort of a campaign — I mean, an election process, whereby they make up for the primary they had before, which was ruled out of order by the Democratic National Committee and you did not campaign in. Theyre talking about mailing it — people mailing in their ballots. Do you trust the security, the honesty of such an election process? The RNC video only included the first sentence of Obamas cautious response. But Obama then made some positive statements about voting by mail: I mean, Oregon, for example, has a terrific mail-in system, but theyve already scanned everybodys signatures whos registered to vote so that they can check to make sure that in fact the right people are voting. And thats something that I think youd have to figure out. During the 2020 pandemic, Obama has not expressly called for only voting by mail. He called for safe voting options while tweeting a New York Times story that debunked the claim that absentee voting favors Democrats and an NPR story about proposals to expand voting by mail and early voting. The clip in the video of Wasserman Schultz does not clearly show the context. The text on the screen reads postal primary do-over — but its difficult to decipher. Debbie Wasserman Schultz argues a mail-in ballot has wrong written all over it, a journalist says. The video then shows a clip of Wasserman Schultz, a Broward Democrat, stating: It would be a risky experiment for us with an election that has stakes as high as a presidential election does. The RNC video omits her next sentence: We've never done a mail-in ballot statewide. She also said that there's a way to solve this without totally redoing this and causing more chaos. Those clips are from a CNN report on March 10, 2008, about the idea for a mail-in primary do-over. Wasserman Schultz was talking about voting by mail in the narrow context of the proposed re-do election that spring. After months of wrangling that spring, the DNC agreed that Florida could send a full delegation to the convention, but each delegate would only get half a vote. Amid the pandemic, Wasserman Schultz said she supports expanding early voting and vote by mail options. The video also includes a quote by Eric Holder, a former Attorney General under Obama. No form of electoral fraud ever has been or will ever be tolerated by this administration, Holder said. That stems from a speech he gave about voting rights in 2012; he wasnt specifically talking about absentee ballot fraud. An RNC video says Joe Biden said voting by mail is a way to fundamentally change this country, contradicting past statements by Barack Obama and Debbie Wasserman Schultz. The RNC video only includes snippets of statements by Obama and Wasserman Schultz to leave viewers with a misleading impression that they were bashing voting by mail in general, and that wasnt the case. Obama and Wasserman Schultz were talking about voting by mail in a narrow set of circumstances: a controversial proposal to redo the presidential preference primary in Florida in 2008. There is no evidence that overall either Democrat was broadly critical of voting by mail as an option in elections. The portion of the video about Biden also omits context. The video quotes him stating we have an incredible opportunity to not just dig out of this crisis but to fundamentally change this country, before launching into the videos theme that Democrats want to use mail-in balloting to radically change American elections. But Biden wasnt talking about elections, he was talking about protecting workers amid the pandemic. This video includes actual quotes by these three Democrats, but lacks context to explain their remarks. This video rates Mostly False.

Final Rating: Mostly False  ",Small businesses in West Virginia make up about 96 percent of our state's economy.,"Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., recently cheerleaded West Virginia small businesses in a tweet from his Senate account. Manchin tweeted, Did you know #WV has more than 120k small businesses & they make up about 96% of our state's economy? Remember this & #shopsmall #WVSBDC #SBDCday Did you know #WV has more than 120k small businesses & they make up about 96% of our state's economy? Remember this & #shopsmall #WVSBDC #SBDCday We were surprised that small companies comprise 96 percent of West Virginias economy, so we took a closer look. As it turns out, Manchin used the wrong terminology, ultimately making his claim incorrect. We turned to data from the federal Small Business Administration, which offers fact sheets about small businesses in every state. Manchins in the ballpark for the number of small businesses in the state. The SBA counts 115,673 small businesses, a number that is apt to fluctuate regularly, as companies start up and go out of business. (The agencys definition of a small business is one with fewer than 500 employees.) And the fact sheet has a number close to the 96 percent figure Manchin cited. The SBA says that 98.9 percent of West Virginias businesses are small businesses. But that does not support what Manchin said. Saying that almost 99 percent of West Virginia's businesses are small firms is not what economists refer to as a percentage of the economy. That term refers to the percentage of all economic output, which is sometimes called state-level gross domestic product. The fact sheet doesnt provide small business output as a percentage of the economy, but its certainly well below 96 percent. Why? Because while small businesses account for nearly 99 percent of employers in the state, they only account for about half —50.1 percent — of West Virginia employees. So it isnot credible to say that half of the workforce produces 96 percent of the output while the other half — the big-company workforce —produces just 4 percent of output. In fact, it wouldnt be surprising if the half of West Virginia employees working for big companies account for more than half of economic output, said Gary Burtless, an economist with the Brookings Institution. In the nation as a whole, employees at smaller businesses tend to earn lower compensation than employees in larger businesses, probably indicating they are less productive, Burtless said. All these facts lead me to believe there is no possible way those 120,000 small businesses can account for 96 percent of the production or output of the West Virginia economy. Manchins office declined to comment for this article. Manchin said that small businesses in West Virginia make up about 96 percent of our state's economy. This appears to be a case of mistaken terminology. Small businesses do make up nearly 99 percent of the states employers, but only half of its employees. The way it is worded, Manchin's claim exaggerates the output of small businesses and underplays the economic influence of large companies in the state.",0.4,0.7,0.9,0.5,0.1,0.5,0.6,0.8,0.4,mostly-false

Final Rating: Mostly False","In sanctuary cities, local officials order police to release dangerous criminal aliens to prey upon the public instead of handing them over to ICE to be safely removed.","During the 2020 State of the Union address, President Donald Trump slammed sanctuary cities for their limited cooperation with Immigration and Customs Enforcement. In sanctuary cities, local officials order police to release dangerous criminal aliens to prey upon the public instead of handing them over to ICE to be safely removed, he said. Trump cited an incident in which an undocumented immigrant released from custody allegedly assaulted and killed a 92-year-old woman in New York City. Trump also spotlighted the brother of a man killed in a crime spree by an undocumented immigrant released in California. The United States of America should be a sanctuary for law-abiding Americans, not criminal aliens, he said, calling on Congress to pass a bill to let victims sue sanctuary cities. Theres no federal definition for a sanctuary city, and the details vary from place to place. But broadly speaking, the term refers to any jurisdiction that refuses to continue holding people in local jails beyond their jail or prison sentence solely because ICE has asked the jurisdiction to do so. (ICEs request is formally known as a detainer.) The individual cases Trump addressed were documented in media reports, and the White House has published a list of other criminal noncitizens shielded from ICE officials. But Trumps claim that local officials order police to release dangerous criminal aliens makes setting criminals free sounds like standard operating procedure. As we detailed while fact-checking a similar claim in 2018, thats not the case. Even sanctuary cities typically turn over to ICE many of the felons Trump warns about. The White House and Trump campaign did not respond to requests for comment. ICE news releases report numerous instances of ignored detainer requests that result in undocumented immigrants being set free and later arrested by ICE. According to ICEs report for the 2019 fiscal year, 86% of the roughly 143,000 noncitizens arrested by ICE had criminal convictions or pending charges. Its unclear how many were arrested after being released in sanctuary cities. The report says ICE issued 165,487 detainers to law enforcement officials, and that a number of aliens who have been released under these circumstances have gone on to commit additional crimes. Some insight came during an October Senate hearing, when ICE official Timothy Robbins said the agency brought roughly 1,300 noncitizens into custody over the span of a few weeks, including large numbers of people who had been released in sanctuary cities. Robbins said three of those 1,300 people had prior convictions for manslaughter or murder, 100 had convictions for sexual assault or related crimes, 70 had convictions for drug-related crimes, and 320 had convictions for driving under the influence. Almost 200 of the aliens arrested during the most recent operation could have been taken into custody at local jails if the detainer had been honored, Robbins said. Robbins did not say whether any of the 200 people ICE targeted with detainers went on to commit further crimes or, in Trumps words, prey on Americans. Sanctuary policies across the country treat dangerous criminals differently, but experts told us many have specific ways of dealing with them. A number of the sanctuary policies have carve-outs for individuals with certain types of felony offenses, and some non-felony offenses, Annie Lai, clinical professor of law at the University of California Irvine, told us. You want to see if the policy allows for detention for ICE, notification to ICE, transfer to ICE or transfer only with a warrant. Each of these mean different things. Californias sanctuary law, for example, gives law enforcement officials leeway to hold someone for ICE if theyve committed one of a number of crimes. The list includes gang-related offenses, assault, battery, sexual abuse and exploitation, rape, crimes endangering children, burglary, robbery, theft, fraud, forgery, any crime resulting in death, some domestic violence offenses, and drug and weapon-related offenses. In New York City, people convicted of one or more of 177 types of felonies within the last five years can be handed over to ICE authorities, but only if those authorities secure a warrant first. Michelle Mittelstadt, director of communications at the Migration Policy Institute, told us shes unaware of a jurisdiction that releases dangerous criminal aliens as a matter of policy. Where jurisdictions have set limits on their cooperation with ICE typically revolve around the issue of whether the agency is seeking transfer of a noncitizen who has been booked or charged versus an offender who is completing a criminal sentence, as well as whether ICE needs to seek a court order for the request to detain a noncitizen, she added. Mittelstadt explained that when noncitizens are released in sanctuary cities, the criminal justice process has taken place or is taking place as it would in the case of anyone else. When state and local prisons release noncitizens without transfer to ICE, the person has completed their criminal sentence, has been released without charge, or has been charged and released on bond pending further action in the criminal justice system, she said. The New York City murder suspect Trump mentioned had originally been arrested for attacking his father with a broken coffee cup and arraigned on charges of assault and criminal possession of a weapon before he was released pending trial, according to reports. He had not yet been convicted on those charges by the time of the alleged murder. Meanwhile, the California man who went on a crime spree in 2018 had previously been convicted of armed robbery. But the charge was 15 years old, meaning local police couldnt use it to justify holding him for ICE, according to the Washington Post. He had been deported twice before, in 2004 and 2014, and was arrested in 2018 after a caller reported erratic behavior. He tested positive for use of a controlled substance, but because that offense only carried a misdemeanor charge, he was released after 10 hours in custody. Mike Boudreaux, the county sheriff on the case, blamed Californias sanctuary law for keeping his officers from coordinating with ICE authorities. That tool has been removed from our hands, he said, according to the Washington Post. And because of that, our county was shot up by a violent criminal. Trump said, In sanctuary cities, local officials order police to release dangerous criminal aliens to prey upon the public instead of handing them over to ICE to be safely removed. Sanctuary policies dont mean that undocumented criminals get to walk free of charges, or that local officials order police to release them as standard operating procedure. Noncitizens facing arrest still go through the criminal justice system; sanctuary policies mean that they arent turned over to ICE authorities after theyve done so. Still, many sanctuary policies include specific provisions allowing law enforcement to comply with ICEs requests when it comes to noncitizens who have been convicted of felonies. Thats the case in both California and New York City — the two places Trump called out by name. Media reports and ICE press releases have documented some cases in which noncitizens with serious criminal records were released by police in spite of detainer requests. But these individuals had already gone through the criminal justice system in one way or another.",0.3,0.8,0.7,0.4,0.6,0.9,0.5,0.5,0.3,mostly-false

Final Rating: Mostly False  ",Says opponent Mary Burke told reporters she would have required workers to give up bargained-for healthcare and retirement benefits like Gov. Walker.,"Democrat Brett Hulsey says that any union member who supports Mary Burke is like a chicken who votes for Colonel Sanders. Thems fightin words -- and theyre aimed at a fellow Democrat vying to take on Republican Gov. Scott Walker in the November election. Hulsey, a state representative from Madison and former vice president of a union local at a Sierra Club office, alleges outsourcing of jobs by Trek Bicycle when Burke was a Trek board member. Hulsey is also displeased with Burkes support of a charter school in Madison, where she is on the school board. But what really miffs Hulsey is Burke saying it was reasonable and fair for public employees to pay more toward their state-funded pensions and health insurance in 2011. In his controversial move to sharply limit collective bargaining, Walker and fellow Republicans imposed those cost-sharing moves on state employees and cleared the way for local governments to do the same. It was part of the law known as Act 10. Hulsey is accusing Burke of Walker-like anti-union behavior regarding those benefits and other issues. She supports taking public servants healthcare and retirement benefits, Hulsey claimed in a May 21, 2014 news release. And in a letter to Burke in advance of the South Central Federation of Labors annual bean feed, a long-running celebration sponsored by the Madison-based labor union umbrella group, Hulsey wrote: You told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel that you would have required workers to give up bargained for healthcare and retirement benefits like Gov. Walker. Is Hulsey right? Burkes statements on Act 10 Burke, who entered the governors race in early October 2013, has been remarkably consistent in her comments on Act 10. As support for his claim, Hulsey cites an April 18, 2014 interview with the Journal Sentinel in which Burke said she would work to restore collective bargaining for public workers while still seeking efficient government. In the interview, Burke said: If I had been governor I would have made sure I bargained for the changes that needed to be made to balance the state budget. I think it was only fair to ask for contributions to health care and pensions but I think those could have been negotiated, certainly firmly but fairly. Walkers approach, she said, left the state divided and has caused teachers and prospective educators to question whether salaries and benefits will be sufficient to support their careers and pay off student loans. Wisconsin walked away from the table and left it in a worse place, Burke said. So, Burke staked out a somewhat nuanced position. She defended getting public workers to pay more. She said shed have negotiated over the pension and health changes, in contrast to Walkers approach of removing those as subjects of bargaining. And she suggested she could have achieved a result similar to Walkers by being firm in her ask for the benefits changes. Could she have? Thats debatable. In 2011, some union leaders at one point said theyd agree to the benefits givebacks. But that was under extreme pressure because Walker had the votes for the stringent limits on bargaining -- and a ban on employers from deducting union dues from employee paychecks. In any event, its clear from Burkes comments that she wanted a similar result on pension and healthcare cost-sharing as Walker, but wouldnt -- and couldnt -- have required workers to pay more. Thats because, she said, shed have negotiated to try to get that. But her comments also suggest she would have made a high priority of getting those fair givebacks in exchange for something else. Burkes comments have been met with disappointment from some quarters on the left and among union leaders, but shes received endorsements from the largest state employee union, major teachers unions and the state AFL-CIO. They said her support is clear for collective bargaining, which she described as something that I believe in and think is right for our state, in an appearance on The Devils Advocates radio show. Meanwhile, Hulsey is making a full-throated pledge to try to repeal Act 10 as a whole, including the benefits cuts, saying the cuts were not necessary. He has pledged to provide back pay to workers whose wages declined because of the act. Hulsey told us that Burkes comments -- that she would have negotiated the benefits changes she needed -- amount to an approach that would have required the cuts of workers, just in a more humane way than Walker. Our rating Hulsey claimed Burke told Journal Sentinel reporters and editors that she would have required workers to give up bargained-for healthcare and retirement benefits like Gov. Walker. Theres an element of truth here in that Burke did say she backed benefits cuts in the same areas as Walker got, and was confident she could have achieved them. But Hulseys phrasing makes it sound like Burke backs Walkers approach. Thats a huge stretch given that she would have left collective bargaining intact and tried to negotiate the cost-cutting moves.",0.7,0.6,0.9,0.5,0.4,0.5,0.4,0.8,0.6,mostly-false

Ted Cruz said there could have been laws on the books to prevent what happened, had his opponents in Congress not defeated his proposal a few years ago. The Democrats filibustered the legislation that wouldve resulted in this shooter being in federal prison instead of murdering those innocents in that Texas church, Cruz said on Fox News on Nov. 6. Cruz, a Republican,is talking about a failed amendment he co-sponsored to curtail an expansion of background checks and increase prosecution of people who lied about their criminal histories to obtain firearms. He has a point that the Democrats didnt back it, but he fails to mention that every amendment on the 2013 gun control bill faced the same hurdle, and a Democratic one also fell short. While Democrats defeated his proposal, experts said it would not have made the crucial difference in this massacre for a couple of reasons. The Texas church shooter was discharged from the Air Force for bad conduct after he was court-martialed in 2012 for assaulting his wife and fracturing his stepson's skull. Federal law prohibited him from buying or possessing firearms after this conviction, but he got past the background check system because the Air Force failed to enter the shooters felony into the background check database. So when he purchased two guns at the San Antonio gun shop Academy Sports + Outdoors, both sales were approved by the National Instant Criminal Background Check System. When we asked Cruzs office for details, they softened what Cruz originally said, saying his legislation would have increased the chances of preventing the Air Force error that led to the failure to submit the relevant information to NICS. The amendment pushed for clearer guidance on submissions of federal records to the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (mandated by NICS Improvement Amendments Act of 2007) and required that federal agencies submit plans for making the information available. The only possible contribution may have been that the reporting requirement to the AG might have led the Defense Department and the Air Force to realize that the procedures they had in place needed enhancement, said Geoffrey Corn, a law professor at South Texas College of Law Houston. But the language was a near replica of President Barack Obamas Jan. 16, 2013 memorandum to the Justice Department, which officials were already trying to implement. Molly Moran, who served as the Principal Deputy Associate Attorney General from 2014 to 2016, said she and her colleagues at the Justice Department worked from 2013 until the end of Obamas second term in implementing the memo. It made no difference in the Texas church shooting. The Air Force needed to submit the shooters 2012 court-martial, and it failed to do so. Cruz said on Fox that a lack of reporting of federal and state records to the background check system was a problem. But his legislation did not seem to make this easier. The amendment eliminated sanctions for states that failed to submit records and lowered the cap on grant money to help states submit them from $100 million to $20 million. The original bill from then-Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., would have expanded background checks on purchases from only federally licensed gun dealers to all transfers, even private ones among family members, with few exceptions. But the Grassley-Cruz amendment chucked the expansion of background checks and even allowed for the interstate sale and transportation of firearms. If anything, the only way this would have affected the Texas shooting would be to make it easier for the shooter to attack a church in a neighboring state instead, said Gregory Koger, a political science professor at the University of Miami. Cruz also summoned a familiar talking point against gun regulation that few background check lies (where felons say they are not felons) are prosecuted. His amendment created a task force to increase these prosecutions, but it did not mandate that the Justice Department prosecute all of them. Enhanced prosecution efforts still would not have put the shooter behind bars. Without the court-martial in the database, the shooter would still have passed the background check after marking that he was not a felon. He could have been prosecuted had his lie been known by prosecutors, but they had no reason to investigate this until after the shooting, said Adam Winkler, a law professor at University of California, Los Angeles. Reid set a 60-vote threshold on all amendments to his Safe Communities, Safe Schools Act of 2013 to prevent a situation in which the amendment passed by a bare majority and then was filibustered — by the Republican minority. Cruzs amendment failed 52-48, with nine Democrats voting for it and two Republicans voting against (Mark Kirk of Illinois and Mike Lee of Utah). So did the bipartisan Toomey-Manchin background check amendment favored by Democrats, which got 54 votes. Experts said it was fair to call this a filibuster, though Reid attained the Senate's unanimous consent for the 60-vote threshold. The notion that the Democrats are responsible for the failure of this proposal ignores the fact that the GOP was filibustering the underlying bill, which had all the same provisions except the state-to-state expansion of gun rights and a requirement to expand background checks, Koger said. Cruz said, The Democrats filibustered the legislation that wouldve resulted in this shooter being in federal prison. The amendment Cruz cosponsored, which was defeated largely by Democrats after failing to reach a 60-vote threshold, strengthened efforts to prosecute people who lied about their criminal histories to obtain firearms. But the shooter in this case wouldnt have showed up as having lied because of the Air Forces failure to report his felony. The Cruz proposal also aimed to facilitate reporting to the instant background check system with guidelines and deadlines for federal agencies, including the armed services. While similar action by the Obama Justice Department around the same time didnt help, Cruzs clarifications becoming law may have. But its impossible to say with any certainty.",0.5,0.7,0.9,0.6,0.8,0.7,0.5,1.0,0.4,mostly-false

Final Rating: Mostly False  ","In states that have legalized (recreational marijuana), you see steady decreases in youth use if you do it right.","Among the issues taking center stage in Springfield as lawmakers enter the final stretch of the legislative session is whether Illinois should join a growing number of states in lifting a prohibition on recreational marijuana. While the legislation under consideration would bar legal sales to those under 21, critics have raised concerns that the easier access could still lead to greater use among teens. One Democratic lawmaker who spoke in support of the plan when it was unveiled recently by Gov. J.B. Pritzker was state Rep. Kelly Cassidy, a Chicago Democrat. Cannabis should be sold in venues that are highly regulated, taking the pot market out of the shadows, Cassidy said. In states that have legalized, you see steady decreases in youth use if you do it right. PolitiFact in recent years has assessed changes in pot use among youth while investigating claims about how legalization has affected citizens in Colorado, which became the first state in the nation to greenlight retail sales in 2014 after voters approved cannabis for adult recreational use by ballot measure in 2012. Since 2014, the data show no statistically significant uptick in pot usage among teens so legalization hardly leads to the reefer madness some critics feared. But the numbers available for Colorado and other states that have lifted bans for adults also dont reveal the clear pattern of decline in youth pot use that Cassidy described. If lawmakers approve the plan, Illinois could become the 11th state to allow adults to use cannabis recreationally and the second in the Midwest, after Michigan, where voters in November approved a measure legalizing the drug. So far, retail sales are up and running in seven of those states, including three in just the last three years. That makes it harder to come by comprehensive statistics. Cassidy sent us an email promising an aide would share the studies out of Colorado, but nothing arrived from the lawmakers office as of our deadline. She also didnt explain what she meant by do it right. Colorado and Washington were the first states to legalize retail marijuana sales, so they have the longest track records to study. In Colorado, a 2018 report by the state Department of Public Safety'sDivision of Justice reviewed data from the Healthy Kids Colorado Survey, which includes answers to various health questions asked of more than 40,000 middle and high school students every other year. The survey is conducted by the states Department of Public Health & Environment. Results from the survey show 19.7% of Colorado high schoolers reported using marijuana within the past month in 2013, the year before the first retail marijuana store opened. In 2015, that figure rose slightly, but experts told PolitiFact in 2016 that increase was not statistically significant. In 2017, the rate dipped to 19.4%, slightly lower than it had been in previous surveys dating back to least 2005. But the Colorado report includes a major disclaimer. It states upfront that the majority of data related to marijuana legalization is baseline and preliminary, making it difficult to draw conclusions about the potential effects of marijuana legalization and commercialization on public safety, public health, or youth outcomes due to the lack of historical data. Jonathan Caulkins, a public policy professor at Carnegie Mellon University and former co-director of RANDs Drug Policy Research Center, echoed that warning to PolitiFact Illinois. The full effects of cannabis legalization wont be seen for a generation after national legalization, which has not even happened yet, he wrote in an email. As for preliminary state results? Caulkins said that making recreational marijuana legal for adults has done little to affect use by youth — in large part because cannabis was already relatively easy for minors to obtain in those states. Indeed, material included in the Colorado survey characterizes as relatively unchanged the slight variations in teen marijuana use since legalization. Voters in Washington also approved recreational cannabis in late 2012, and retail sales of the drug there began in 2014, six months after Colorado. The state conducts a biennial youth health survey similar to Colorados, which breaks its data down by grades. Its results show some small declines but suggest little has changed there either, with decreases of 1% between 2014 and 2016 among 8th and 10th graders who said they currently used pot, followed by 1% increases for both grades in 2018. For 12th graders, rates fell by 1% the year after retail sales began and have remained at that level, which is in line with pre-legalization rates. The findings with respect to youth are generally mixed and depend critically on what measures of youth use one wants to focus on, said Rosalie Pacula, a senior economist with RAND and current co-director of the Drug Policy Research Center who analyzed survey data for Washington and Colorado in several recent reports. She explained in an email to us that studies of states where adult use is legal generally show either no effect or some decline in past-year or 30-day use rates among youth, depending on the survey data used. But results for more frequent and risky use are a bit more mixed, she said, with some showing an uptick. Changes in the other five states where retail sales are underway are even more difficult to evaluate than Colorado or Washington. Alaskas state survey reported no statistically significant changes since recreational cannabis was approved for adults in 2014 and hit the market in 2016. Results in Oregon, which followed a similar timeline, were mixed. And its too soon to assess results out of Nevada, California and Massachusetts, which each repealed bans in late 2016 but only began allowing sales within the last two years. Cassidy said, In states that have legalized, you see steady decreases in youth use if you do it right. She did not provide any proof to back up her statement. Of the 10 states that allow adults to use cannabis recreationally, only four have permitted retail sales long enough to provide enough data points for a preliminary comparison. While state survey data show no spike in current marijuana use among teens, they also fall short of suggesting the downward trajectory Cassidy described.

Final Rating: Mostly False",The National Debt in my first month went down by $12 billion.,"In an early morning tweet Saturday, President Donald Trump echoed a post on a fringe website claiming that the national debt has decreased by $12 billion since Trump took office. The media has not reported that the National Debt in my first month went down by $12 billion vs a $200 billion increase in Obama first mo., Trump posted on Twitter Feb. 25, 2017. The media has not reported that the National Debt in my first month went down by $12 billion vs a $200 billion increase in Obama first mo. The tweet mirrors an article posted on the Gateway Pundit website a few days earlier. It was repeated by conservative pundit Herman Cain on Fox News shortly before Trumps tweet. On January 20th, the day of the Trump Inauguration, the US Debt stood at $19,947 billion, the Gateway Pundit website reads. On February 21st, a month later, the US Debt load stood at $19,935 billion. Trump cut the US Debt burden by $12 billion and 0.1% in his first month in office! The numbers check out. And in fact, the total public debt has dropped another $22 billion since the Gateway Pundit article published, according to data from the U.S. Department of Treasury. But, experts say, people shouldnt read much into the numbers. Nor should Trump be popping champagne. Considering that Trump hasnt enacted any fiscal legislation, its a bit of a stretch for him to take credit for any changes in debt levels, Dan Mitchell, a libertarian economist and senior fellow at the Cato Institute, told us. Debt levels go up and down in the short run based on independent factors such as quarterly tax payments and predetermined expenditure patterns, he said. The White House did not respond to our query for this fact-check. Looking at the debt numbers Trump and the Gateway Pundit are examining the total public debt outstanding, which is nearing $20 trillion. Experts said another figure to focus on is debts held by the public, which is the amount of money the United States government owes someone else. On Jan. 20, when Trump took office, the debt held by the public sat at $14.4 trillion. That figure fluctuated up and down a bit, but as of Feb. 22, it remained $14.4 trillion. On Feb. 23, the debt held by the public figure dropped to $14.38 trillion. Heres a chart that shows debt figures on selected days since Trump took office. Date Debt Held by the Public Intragovernmental Holdings Total Public Debt Outstanding 01/20/2017 14,403,704,176,388.94 5,543,600,378,823.55 19,947,304,555,212.49 01/27/2017 14,387,267,502,732.51 5,551,752,332,096.38 19,939,019,834,828.89 02/02/2017 14,366,132,157,960.80 5,536,695,305,608.30 19,902,827,463,569.10 02/07/2017 14,365,365,821,333.09 5,530,397,847,836.97 19,895,763,669,170.06 02/09/2017 14,402,429,500,385.19 5,519,906,129,921.50 19,922,335,630,306.69 02/14/2017 14,404,012,711,812.97 5,528,666,521,903.19 19,932,679,233,716.16 02/15/2017 14,417,333,314,382.25 5,520,031,281,120.76 19,937,364,595,503.01 02/16/2017 14,403,392,566,439.40 5,523,188,600,438.96 19,926,581,166,878.36 02/22/2017 14,404,723,995,058.93 5,531,156,856,922.13 19,935,880,851,981.06 02/23/2017 14,384,082,361,381.86 5,529,818,758,806.29 19,913,901,120,188.15 So, in isolation, the debt held by the public is down since Trump took office. But experts say its likely to shoot back up any day. I wonder what he thinks he did to bring this about, said Harvard University government professor Jeffrey Frankel. This one-month number is trivial in the long-run trend. The national debt will rise this year, and in future years. It will rise at a sharply accelerated rate if Trump carries out even half of his campaign promises for specific tax cuts (and specific spending increases). Will he be willing to be judged by the debt numbers in the future? Dean Baker, an economist with the liberal Center for Economic and Policy Research, said the temporary dip in the debt is triggered by the timing of tax payments and government spending, both matters that he has not affected one iota. AddedNeil Buchanan, a George Washington University law professor and author of The Debt Ceiling Disasters:No one who knows anything about budgeting would take a 30-day change to have any meaning at all.There is no credit to take, because it's like noticing that rainfall numbers from one month to the next are not exactly the same or that attendance at baseball games is not a constant number. Donald Marron, Director of Economic Policy Initiatives at the Urban Institute,speculated that the drop in debt may be because President Barack Obamas administration left Trump with cash on hand to run the government. So the government's need to borrow hasn't been high recently. On Jan. 20, the day Trump took office, the federal government had a cash operating balance of $382 billion, according to the Treasury Department. By Feb. 22, the cash balance had dropped to $228 billion. Our ruling Trump tweeted, The National Debt in my first month went down by $12 billion. Trump would be wise to not read too much into this figure, which sounds more noteworthy than it actually is. The national debt fluctuates up and down depending on the day. While the debt is down after one month, experts say that trend will reverse and the debt will continue to rise. This factoid is a gross misrepresentation of the state of the debt and the role the new president had in shaping the figure. Update: This post has been updated to include comments from Neil Buchanan and to include Donald Marron's current title. ",0.5,0.7,1.0,0.6,0.2,0.6,0.5,1.0,0.4,mostly-false

Final Rating: Mostly False  ","Says Gov. Scott Walker raises the pay of inmates, but we don't raise the pay of staff in our correctional institutions.","Wisconsin state employees union leader Marty Beil is no fan of Gov. Scott Walker. And his criticism has not relented since Walker survived an historic recall election in June 2012.Beil took aim at Walker on July 19, 2012 in an interview with John Sly Sylvester, a liberal radio talk show host on WTDY AM-FM in Madison.Walker raises the pay of inmates, Beil complained, but we don't raise the pay of staff in our correctional institutions.In 2011, Walker curbed state employees collective bargaining powers and cut their take-home pay by forcing them to pay more for their pensions and health insurance. He also put tighter restrictions on overtime for corrections workers.But has the Republican governor increased the pay of inmates who work in prisons, yet not given raises to the officers who work there?Beil's evidenceBeil is executive director of the Madison-based Council 24 of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees union, which represents corrections officers and a variety of other state employees.Asked for evidence to back his claim, he forwarded to us a May 2012 email from Lizzie Tegels, warden of the New Lisbon Correctional Institution, a 500-cell, medium-security prison 80 miles northwest of Madison.It says the prison would no longer pay a lower wage to inmates during their first 60 days of work. Paying new inmate workers a few pennies per hour less during their probationary period costs more -- in staff time to adjust pay rates -- than if the inmates received the regular wage, the email said.So, this isnt giving any working inmates a pay raise. Rather, inmates new to working would get a higher starting wage than they would have previously, but only during their first two months on the job.Beil told us the change wasn't occurring only at New Lisbon, but suggested we contact the Department of Corrections for details.Since Beil's claim was aimed at Walker, we contacted the governor's office, as well as the Department of Corrections. Walker spokesman Cullen Werwie and DOC spokeswoman Linda Eggert confirmed that corrections employees have not received a general raise since Walker took office in January 2011.Indeed, lawmakers in November 2011 imposed a two-year pay freeze on state employees, although merit raises can be given.So, the second part of Beils claim, that corrections workers havent gotten any raises under Walker, is correct. DOC response As for inmate pay, the governors spokesman provided a response written by the office of Corrections Secretary Gary Hamblin.According to the memo:Wisconsin prisons can pay working inmates a lower wage during their probation period, but most don't; neither does Badger State Industries, which oversees the manufacturing of license plates and other goods made by inmates.Eliminating the lower pay rate at New Lisbon means that current and future workers now start at the regular pay grade. That ranges from 9 to 42 cents an hour (and 1 to 20 cents through Badger State Industries). About 1,000 inmates work at New Lisbon, with about 20 to 25 on probationary status at any given time.Eggert said DOC surveyed all prisons after we contacted her and found that none had given inmates any raises or eliminated lower probationary rates like New Lisbon did.So, the higher pay rate is limited to the relatively few working inmates at one prison, and only applies to their first two months on the job.Our ratingBeil said Walker has raised the pay of working inmates, but we don't raise the pay of staff in our correctional institutions. Neither group, however, has received a pay raise.The pay rate at one prison is now higher for new workers during their two-month probation period, but that was done not to give inmates raises but to save money for taxpayers.",0.5,0.5,1.0,0.5,0.3,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.4,mostly-false

Final Rating: Mostly False  ",SaysCongressman Jack Kingston voted to raise his pay seven times.,"Veteran U.S. Rep. Jack Kingston of Savannah and millionaire businessman David Perdue are stepping up their attacks as decision day rapidly approaches in the GOP primary runoff for the U.S. Senate. Kingston and Perdue are locked in whats arguably the most contentious and closely watched Georgia contest on the July 22 primary runoff ballot. Charges and countercharges are flying. One of the charges being leveled by Perdue, the front-runner in the May primary, is that Kingston has wasted tax dollars on earmarks all while voting to raise his own pay seven times. PolitiFact has already examined the claim about Kingstons record on earmarks. Now, well delve into the second part of the claim thats currently airing on television and radio and answer the question: Did Kingston, a member of Congress since 1993, vote to raise his own congressional pay seven times? With public opinion of Congress in the tank, House and Senate members have been loath to raise their own pay. Thats likely why congressional raises are a campaign issue, not just this year and not just in Kingstons race. That also may explain why fact-checking the claim is more complicated than simply pulling legislation and checking individual House and Senate members votes. First, a little history. Article I, Section 6, of the Constitution requires members of Congress to set their own pay. From 1789 to 1968, members of Congress passed specific bills that raised their pay 22 times, according to a June 2014 report by the Congressional Research Service. Members of Congress were initially paid a daily rate -- $6 a day in 1789 -- and drew their first annual salary -- $1,500 -- in 1815. Forty years later, they were drawing $3,000 a year. But since passage of the Ethics Reform Act of 1989, members of the House and Senate have been eligible for annual raises without having to be on-record voting for them. The raises are calculated by a formula that involves changes in private-sector wages and salaries. They are automatic each Jan. 1 unless Congress votes to reject the adjustment or votes to change the amount. According to the Congressional Research Service, lawmakers have let their pay be increased automatically 13 times. Theyve also voted to decline or delay their raises during 11 years, including in 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013 and 2014. Kingston voted with the majority eight times. That is, Kingston voted to limit his pay, not increase it. In January 2009, congressional salaries went from $169,300 to their current $174,000. (And unless they vote again to decline a raise, lawmakers pay is set to increase 1.6 percent, or $2,800, in January, according to recent estimates.) So how can Perdue say that Kingston voted to raise his own pay seven times when automatic pay raises were established in 1989 and Kingstons only been in Congress since Jan. 3, 1993? Heres the simple answer: Perdues not counting Kingstons votes in favor of raising congressional salaries. Instead, Perdues counting procedural votes Kingston cast. Those votes blocked efforts to nix the automatic pay raises. PolitiFact checked a similar claim in 2011 when U.S. Rep. Connie Mack IV came under attack by Republican rival George LeMieux in Floridas U.S. Senate race. That was rated a Half True. Perdues claim, like LeMieuxs, is based largely on procedural votes. The votes by Kingston took place in 1999, 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004, 2006 and 2007, Perdue spokesman Derrick Dickey said. We'll try to explain a complicated process as simply as we can. A member of Congress -- for years it was U.S. Rep. Jim Matheson, D-Utah -- pushes for an up-or-down vote on continuing the automatic pay raises. In most years, a procedural vote is used to effectively block that effort. Alyson Heyrend, Matheson's then-spokeswoman, explained the procedural move to PolitiFact in 2011. Matheson each year sought a 'no' vote on a procedural vote on Ordering the Previous Question, she told Politifact in an email. Had a majority voted 'no' he would have then offered the amendment to deny the annual congressional pay raise. Matheson was concerned that the public isn't able to see Congress take an open, up-or-down vote on whether or not to raise their salaries, Heyrend said. Pete Sepp, executive vice president of the National Taxpayers Union and Foundation, said its important to understand that any efforts on the pay raises are always tied to larger bills dealing with appropriations. People of varying ideologies and causes would have numerous reasons for supporting or opposing the bill, Sepp said, meaning that votes for or against a bill could have something or nothing to do with the pay raise. In 1999, for instance, Rep. Ernie Fletcher, R, Ky., argued that lawmakers shouldnt take a $3,800 raise, boosting their pay to $145,000 a year, saying: I have a hard time voting to increase my pay when people in my district are earning an average income of $25,000 a year. According to press reports from the time, Fletchers move was defeated on a procedural vote, 250-173. House journals show Kingston voting with the majority. The journals also show Kingston voting Yes with the majority on similar procedural votes in 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004, 2006 and 2007. Those votes blocked efforts by Matheson, Fletcher and others to put forth an amendment to stop the pay raise. And even if they had not been blocked, a majority would have still had to go along with their amendment, several congressional experts told us. So, did Kingston vote seven times to give himself a raise? No. He didnt have to because the raises are automatic unless Congress votes to turn them down as they have for five years. Did he vote to stop a push for an up-or-down vote on accepting or rejecting the raises? Yes. He did that seven times. But he also voted with the majority to deny or delay the raises eight times. Greg Dolan, Kingstons congressional spokesman, said: Representative Kingston was not voting to increase his pay any more than he was voting against renaming the moon. Just because a potential amendment may have been introduced, voting to get on with the work of the House is not equivalent to voting against any and all other extraneous issues, he said. Dickey, Perdues spokesman, said the pay raises were inappropriate and Kingston knew that as far back as 1992 when he told a Savannah paper that congressional raises should be tied to passage of a balanced budget Our ruling Congress has created a system that allows its members to receive annual raises without having to vote on them. Perdue is off base to say Kingston voted to raise his pay seven times. Kingston cast procedural votes -- with the majority -- that effectively allowed Congress automatic pay raises to stand in some years. Kingston did not cast direct votes to raise his pay as Perdues ads imply. When there was a direct vote to decline pay increases, Kingston voted with the majority to do just that eight times. Theres a bit of truth to Perdues claim. But theres even more context missing. ",0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,mostly-false

Final Rating: Mostly False  ",Wisconsin has no tracing program going on that we can speak of.,"Facing a growing push to re-open Wisconsin, Gov. Tony Evers has laid out a series of key benchmarks for easing social distancing restrictions, dubbed the Badger Bounce Back plan. The state is tracking data on cases, symptoms and hospital usage, but Evers has also pointed to three other logistical elements: access to personal protective gear, expanded testing and expanded contact tracing. Senate Majority Leader Scott Fitzgerald homed in on the last of those while criticizing Evers in an April 26, 2020, interview with WISN-TVs UpFront program. We need better information. More explanations, said Fitzgerald, R-Juneau. They have no tracing program going on that we can speak of. Contact tracing, done by public health officials, is the process of supporting patients with suspected or confirmed infections. Steps include identifying who else they had contact with, warning those other individuals and educating everyone exposed on how to protect themselves and others through isolation and other steps. Its a fundamental element of the pandemic response, helping to identify clusters of cases early on to minimize the spread. Does Wisconsin really have no such program to speak of? Asked for evidence of the claim, Fitzgerald spokesman Alec Zimmerman said this: The point he was trying to make is the same that (Wisconsin Department of Health Services) makes daily in the briefings -- tracing as it is now isnt enough. Zimmerman noted the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel has reported on shortcomings in the system. For instance, the newspaper contacted 10 people who had the disease or lost loved ones within the first few weeks of the outbreak, and seven said they were never contacted by health officials as of April 23 when the story published. A story published May 1, 2020, detailed how Milwaukee has added staffing and made other changes to improve the tracing program. Health officials across the nation are scrambling to add contact tracers. The number of tracers needed for the pandemic is about double the usual need, according to the National Association of County and City Health Officials. Public health nurses do this regularly, for example, for sexually transmitted diseases or tuberculosis, DHS spokeswoman Elizabeth Goodsitt said in an email. What is new in this space is mainly the large scale of cases and the speed at which the virus is able to spread – which means we need additional contact tracers to do this work so that we are able to reach each identified exposed person really quickly. DHS doesnt know how many tracers are working in Wisconsin or how many tracing investigations have been done since those efforts are lead by local health departments. DHS Deputy Secretary Julie Willems Van Dijk said at the April 28 COVID-19 media briefing that the goal is to have 1,000 contact tracers between the DHS surge capacity and the capacity of local health departments. The state had trained 400 contact tracers as of April 30 to provide surge capacity for local health departments, Goodsitt said. The number trained was closer to 250 when Fitzgerald made his claim. The state surge team has been part of more than 1,100 interviews (as of April 30), which is just a fraction of calls our local public health tracers have made, Goodsitt said. The number of tracers varies widely among some of the states larger health departments. As of April 25, the Journal Sentinel reported the Milwaukee Health Department had dedicated 19 people to tracing, about 8% of its staff (though that was up to 54 by May 1, 2020). The Washington Ozaukee Health Department had dedicated 15 people, or about 38% of its 40-person staff. CBS 58 reported April 23 that Waukesha County had 30 contact tracers. Milwaukee officials told the Journal Sentinel the initial tracing interview had been conducted within a week for 92% of all positive cases in the city, but its an extensive process. They make about 10 contacts for every positive case. Fitzgerald said Wisconsin has no tracing program going on that we can speak of. Wisconsin — like every other state — is still ramping up the capacity for tracing. And there have clearly been gaps in the work so far. But its a significant exaggeration to summarize that as having no program when hundreds of people are doing this work around the state. Tracing was being done around the state when Fitzgerald said this, and those efforts have continued to ramp up since. ",0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,mostly-false

Final Rating: Mostly False  ",We have more kids take the SAT than any other state in the nation. I mean a high percentage of our kids take the SAT.,"As CNBC pronounced Texas the nation's best state for doing business, Gov. Rick Perry offered reasons why Texas is still on top during an interview with the business-news network. One of them: the number of Texas students participating in a national college-admissions' exam. We have more kids take the SAT than any other state in the nation, Perry said on the July 13 CNBC broadcast. I mean a high percentage of our kids take the SAT. Which is it? Bill White, the Democratic nominee for governor who has stressed education as an important issue, thinks it's neither. Rick Perry proved again yesterday that he simply can't tell the truth when it comes to education, a July 14 press release from White chided, saying that Perry gave blatantly false information about SATs. Later that day, the governor's office issued a press release pointing reporters to a July 14 Fortune magazine article that offered four reasons why Texas beats California in a recession. However, the article also notes that SAT scores in the state have declined over the last few years, and the state ranked 34th among the 52 states and jurisdictions graded on the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) last year. Confused? When we checked with Perry's campaign, spokeswoman Catherine Frazier tweaked the first of Perry's CNBC statements by saying Texas has more students taking the SAT than nearly any other state. According to the College Board, which manages the SAT exams, Texas ranked third in 2009 in the number of SAT takers — 141,733 public and private school students. Of course, Texas was also the second-most populous state. California, the most populous state, had the most SAT participants (207,301), followed by New York (159,886). We turned next to Perry's second statement, that a high percentage of our kids take the SAT — arguably a powerful talking point because a state's percentage of SAT takers signifies its share of potential college students. According to the College Board in 2009, Texas had the 22nd highest SAT participation rate (21st if you don't count the District of Columbia): 51 percent of Texas students in the class of 2009. The national average was 46 percent. Maine had the highest participation rate (90 percent), followed by New York, Massachusetts, Connecticut and D.C. In recent years, neither the percentage of SAT-takers in Texas nor the state's place in the College Board rankings has changed much. In 2008, Texas again came in 22nd, with 50 percent of students taking the test. In fact, as long as Perry has been governor, Texas has ranked 20th, 21st or 22nd. Its share of students taking the test has ranged from a high of 57 percent (2003) to, most recently, a low of 51 percent. So how does the governor's two-part statement score? We'll cut him slack for saying Texas has the most students taking the SAT, since he immediately backed off when questioned. And Texas did have the third-highest number of high-school students who took the SAT in 2009. Perry's statement that Texas has a high percentage of students taking the SAT begs the question: High compared to what? While the share of Texas students who took the test in 2009 exceeded the national average, 20 other states had greater shares of students taking the test including similarly high-population states such as Florida, Pennsylvania and New York. California had a smaller share: 49 percent. We figure high means better than barely above average. To stick with the school metaphor, 51 percent is a failing grade.

Final Rating: Mostly False  ",Says Mitt Romney runs away from Ronald Reagan.,"In a web video released on Jan. 13, 2012, Newt Gingrichs presidential campaign took aim at Massachusetts moderate Mitt Romney, comparing him to fellow Bay State politicians (and Democratic presidential losers) Michael Dukakis and John Kerry and even taking him to task for being able to speak French.The ad fires a fusillade of shots designed to show that Romney is too liberal to be a Republican presidential nominee. Weve chosen one of those claims to check.What has Massachusetts given us? the ad asks, offering grainy footage of Dukakis ill-fated tank ride during the 1988 campaign and Kerrys windsurfing from 2004. The video goes on to describe Romney as a Massachusetts moderate who runs away from Ronald Reagan, then cuts to a clip of Romney speaking during a debate while running for Senate in 1994. In the debate, Romney said, Look, I was an independent during the time of Reagan-Bush. Im not trying to return to Reagan-Bush.We have already looked at the question of Romneys view of Reagan, a conservative icon, during a fact-check of a Democratic National Committee ad on Nov. 29, 2011.The DNC ad from 2011 juxtaposes two clips of Romney talking. The first was the same one later used in the Gingrich ad. The second showed Romney standing at a podium saying, The principles that Ronald Reagan espoused are as true today as they were when he spoke them.The 1994 clip, which came during Romneys bid to unseat the late Sen. Edward Kennedy, showed part of an exchange in which the two men had a philosophical discussion about poverty and families. Kennedy, a liberal Democrat, claimed that child poverty rates rose when Republicans occupied the White House.Under the Reagan-Bush economic programs, under the economic programs you want to return to, the total number of children that are living in poverty, the total number of children out of wedlock -- this has happened, you know weve had Republican presidents during this period of time and the cutting back of support systems for children and most of all for families to get jobs, Kennedy said. If youre not going to provide a climate and an atmosphere for men and women to be able to work and provide for their children, youre going to see the breakdown of the family as well.Kennedy said discussions about supporting families shouldnt be used to score political hits, prompting Romney to fire back that he wasnt politicizing the issue -- Kennedy was.I mentioned nothing about politics or your position at all. I talked about what Id do to help strengthen families, and you talked about Reagan-Bush. Look, I was an independent during the time of Reagan-Bush. Im not trying to return to Reagan-Bush, Romney said, in a clear attempt to distance himself from the former president.In our fact-check of the DNC ad, we couldnt find any other references to Romney distancing himself from Reagan beyond the 1994 debate comment. Still, Romney did say it on live television, so we have no quarrel with the Gingrich campaign using it. The Gingrich ad also correctly identified it on-screen as having occurred in 1994, some 18 years ago.But we have a different problem with the Gingrich ad: It erred by using the present tense in the voice-over, saying that Mitt Romney runs away from Ronald Reagan. To us, that means that Romney is still distancing himself from Reagan. And thats definitely not the case.Consider the second clip in the DNC ad, in which Romney was speaking at the annual Reagan lecture at the Reagan library in Simi Valley, Calif., in May 2010. He was talking about Americas position in the world.I have to tell you that Im optimistic. Im optimistic about the future because I recognize that there is a growing awakening among the American people that this administration has put us on the wrong track and that the principles that Ronald Reagan espoused are as true today as they were when he spoke them.After some applause, Romney continued by elaborating on Reagan-like policies emphasizing low taxes, balanced budgets and strong families. While speaking about the need to keep America strong for the sake of world peace, he paraphrased that wonderful line of Reagans:(Reagan) said, Of the four wars that were begun during my lifetime, not one of them was begun because America was too strong. And hes absolutely right, Romney said.We found other examples of Romney's fealty to Reagan's legacy:• During his first presidential campaign in 2007, Romney blasted primary rival John McCain for voting against President George W. Bushs tax cuts. That's failing Reagan 101, Romney said, essentially holding up Reagan as the standard to which Republicans should aspire.• In a debate that year, he was asked whether the primary candidates would support the Republican nominee if it was someone else. Yes, Romney said, then added, I want that nominee, however, to come out of the same mold as Ronald Reagan.• When he proposed a detailed economic plan last year, Romney included a provision for a new Reagan Economic Zone, an international free-trade area designed to reward nations that have embraced free enterprise and open markets.• On Dec. 16, 2011, at a Fox News-sponsored debate, Romney referred to Reagan in explaining his change of heart on abortion. Both Romney and Reagan started off favoring abortion rights before shifting to an anti-abortion stance.I've learned over time, like Ronald Reagan and George Herbert Walker Bush and others, my experience in life over, what, 19 -- 17, 18, 19 years has told me that sometimes I was wrong, Romney said. Where I was wrong, I've tried to correct myself.• On Dec. 15, 2011, the Romney campaign unveiled a group called Reaganites for Romney, featuring officials who served in political or policy roles during the Reagan Administration.These individuals were part of a movement that changed America and the rest of the world, said Romney. The smaller government policies of the Reagan era helped turn around a struggling economy and create millions of jobs. And the strong defense of freedom around the world led to the crumbling of empires and dictatorships. I am proud to announce this group of conservative leaders – with their help we can recreate the robust job creation of the Reagan years.Our rulingGinrgichs ad contains a grain of truth: In one televised debate 18 years ago, Romney distanced himself from Reagan and his policies. But more recently, Romney has had only kind words to say about the Gipper. When the DNC charged that Romney had flip-flopped on his support for Reagans policies, we ruled that charge Mostly True. In this case, though, we dont think Romneys long-ago discomfort with Reagan-era policies justifies the Gingrich ads claim that Romney is a Massachusetts moderate who runs away from Ronald Reagan.",0.5,0.7,0.8,0.4,0.3,0.6,0.5,0.4,0.5,mostly-false

Final Rating: Mostly False  ","Says military commanders have said that if Donald Trump were elected, they would not follow his orders.","During a joint speech with Hillary Clinton in his ancestral home of Scranton, Pa., Vice President Joe Biden riffed on the ways he sees Donald Trump as being unfit for the presidency. One of the things that Biden said troubled him among Trumps past comments is his suggestion that the United States may need to utilize torture. Biden said that Trump has floated the use of torture when he knows it's illegal, and says he would still order it even though the military commanders said they would not obey his orders. When can you think of ever in history where military commanders have said before a man or woman is elected that they would not follow his orders? Biden has a point that Trump has advocated loosening laws on torture, including -- but not limited to -- waterboarding. Just one example: Trump said on CBSs Face the Nation that the United States needs tostrengthen the laws so that we can better compete with the brutal tactics of ISIS, and he dismissed the idea that allowing torture would be stooping to ISIS' level. We have to play the game the way they're playing the game, Trump said. You're not going to win if we're soft. In addition, Trump has proposed killing the families of terrorists, a policy that, as we have written before, would violate the Geneva Conventions. However, Bidens remark suggests that active military commanders have already said before the election that they would not follow certain orders issued by Trump. Thats an overstatement, although one that contains some degree of truth. Lets take a closer look. Who has said what about Trump so far? We could find no evidence -- and Bidens staff couldnt point to any -- showing active military commanders saying they would not follow certain orders from a President Trump. Typically, military officers do not comment on political matters while on active duty, in order to stay within the strictures of Defense Department Directive 1344.10. Senior national security retirees, though, are another story. Bidens staff pointed to comments made in February by former CIA director Michael Hayden on HBO's Real Time with Bill Maher. When Maher brought up Trump's idea of killing family members of terrorists, Hayden said, If he were to order that once in government, the American armed forces would refuse to act. Maher responded, What? Well, thats quite a statement, sir. In the meantime, 50 senior Republican national security officials signed a letter on Aug. 8, 2016, arguing that Trump lacks the character, values and experience to be president and would put at risk our countrys national security and well-being. The letter did not explicitly say that the signers would personally refuse, or encourage active commanders to refuse, an illegal order from Trump. But the letter represented a sharp rebuke to Trumps fitness for office by members of his partys national security establishment. We should point out that Trump does have some senior military retirees on his side as well, including former Defense Intelligence Agency chief Michael T. Flynn, decorated Army Maj. Gen. Bert Mizusawa, retired Marine Corps Brig. Gen. Mark Bircher, retired four star Air Force Gen. Robert Oaks, and retired Army Maj. Gen. Paul Vallely. Bottom line: In his Scranton comments, Biden exaggerated by saying that current military commanders have publicly said they would not follow illegal orders from Trump. Theres no evidence of that. What does the law say? That said, Bidens overstatement is somewhat moot -- because whether or not military commanders have publicly said in advance that they would refuse illegal orders, theres solid legal precedent that they should refuse an illegal order if one came their way. Under both international law and domestic law, a soldier has a duty to disobey a manifestly unlawful order, said Steven R. Ratner, a law professor at the University of Michigan. It doesnt matter who gave it. According to the Manual for Courts-Martial, if an order is patently illegal, a service member has an obliga­tion to disobey it, said Richard D. Rosen, director of the Texas Tech University's Center for Military Law & Policy. The so-called Nuremberg Defense to criminal activity — I was only following orders — excuses a service ­members crimi­nal actions only if the ordered actions are not palpably illegal, Rosen said. This represents a pretty high standard. However, the types of orders at issue here -- such as the infliction of torture and the intentional killing of civilians -- would likely qualify, experts said. I believe that an order to target and kill civilians intentionally, such as killing the families of terrorists, is patently illegal, and I would advise commanders and soldiers not to follow the order, Rosen said. He cited the Vietnam War case of Lt. William Calley, a platoon leader who was accused of killing civilians, including women, children, and elderly men, in the village of My Lai in South Vietnam. Calleys defense was that he was executing the orders of his company commander, but both the Army Court of Military Review and Court of Military Appeals rejected Calleys defense, Rosen said. How unusual is the backlash against Trump? Finally, experts say Biden has a point about the unusual extent of senior military concern about a presidential candidates potential for ordering illegal acts from the White House. There have certainly been overt disputes between presidents and commanders, such as between President Abraham Lincoln and Maj. Gen. George McClellan and between President Harry Truman and Gen. Douglas MacArthur, Rosen said. But I am not aware of cases in which active-duty servicemembers actually took sides in a political campaign. Anthony Clark Arend, a Georgetown University professor of government and foreign service, agreed. I can think of no historical precedent for members of the military and foreign policy community making statements relating to the need to disobey unlawful orders during a presidential campaign, Arend said. This truly seems unprecedented. Our ruling Biden said military commanders have said that if Trump were elected, they would not follow his orders. Biden has a point that retired military officials have spoken out against Trump. But he exaggeratedwhen he described them as military commanders. The current active leadership has not spoken out against Trump.",0.5,0.5,1.0,0.5,0.0,0.5,0.5,1.0,0.5,mostly-false

Final Rating: Mostly False  ",The Federal Reserve system has presided over about a 95... percent decline in the U.S. dollar.,"The dollar ain't what it used to be, and State Board of Education member Barbara Cargill wants Texas students to know it. The board hammered out more than 300 proposed changes to the state's social studies curriculum in its January and March meetings, among them revisions to an economics course that touches on the role of the Federal Reserve in establishing monetary policy. Cargill, a former science teacher from The Woodlands near Houston, proposed an amendment requiring students to analyze the decline in the U.S. dollar since the inception of the Federal Reserve system in 1913. When Gail Lowe, the board chair, asked Cargill if she'd like to speak to her amendment at the March 11 meeting, Cargill said: Well, I think it stands for itself. The Federal Reserve system has presided over a 95... percent decline in the U.S. dollar. Board member Patricia Hardy questioned Cargill's statement: It's amazing how this board knows so much about so many different subjects but I think this is innately biased in its statement and there would be lots of economists who would have a question on the role in this way. Another board member, Mavis Knight, asked: Is the Federal Reserve System the only reason why there has been a decline in the U.S. dollar since 1913? We wondered the same thing. In search of an answer, we first delved into the Fed's history. On Dec. 23, 1913, Congress created the the Federal Reserve System to serve as the nation's central bank. Its primary responsibility is to influence the flow of money and credit in the economy, returning all excess earnings to the U.S. Treasury. Currently, the system's seven board members, including Chairman Ben Bernanke, are responsible for U.S. monetary policy. They constitute a majority of the 12-member Federal Open Market Committee, which makes decisions affecting the cost and availability of money and credit. But does that mean the Fed is responsible for the dollar's decline in value over 90-plus years? Cargill didn't respond to our inquiries. (Board members wound up approving a revision of her amendment stating: Analyze the decline in value of the U.S. dollar including abandonment of the gold standard.) Meanwhile, Dan Hamermesh, an economist at the University of Texas at Austin, called Cargill's connection between the Federal Reserve and the declining dollar propaganda that ignores the impact of inflation from 1913 to 2010. The buying power of a dollar in 1913 would be almost $22 today, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics' Consumer Price Index inflation calculator. That matches up with Cargill's claim that the dollar has dropped in value by 95 percent. Then again, annual income per person is about $32,000 today, compared to about $400 in 1913 ($8,757 in 2010 dollars) — a hefty increase in earning power. Barry Bosworth, an economist at the left-leaning Brookings Institute, similarly said the Federal Reserve isn't responsible for the U.S. dollar's value, which he called pretty constant relative to other currencies. The decline in the value of the dollar is the result of inflation, but advocates of the gold standard may argue that it could have been avoided if the U.S. had stayed on the gold standard, so they blame the Federal Reserve Bank, Bosworth said. The value of U.S. dollar was tied to gold until 1973, when the United States, switched from a system of fixed exchange rates to floating rates. In simple terms, inflation is when the price of goods and services rises and buying power erodes. Do Federal Reserve critics blame the Fed for that, too? Jesse Benton, a spokesman for Rep. Ron Paul, R-Lake Jackson, said the congressman agrees with Cargill's claim. Benton said that Paul, a former Libertarian candidate, believes inflation is caused by increases in the money supply — which the Fed controls — rather than prices going up. Dollar-driven inflation (then) causes a rise in prices, Benton said. We think that it's very important to keep that in mind. Robert Auerbach, a professor of public affairs at the University of Texas, former banking committee investigator and author of the book, Deception and Abuse at the Fed: Henry B. Gonzalez Battles Alan Greenspan's Bank, told us Cargill's amendment was misleading because it oversimplified both the dollar's and the Federal Reserve's history. Auerbach was trained by Nobel Prize-winning economist Milton Friedman, one of two free-market economists who board members recently voted to add to the state's curriculum. In his career, Friedman famously championed killing inflation by keeping the supply of money growing at a steady but slow pace, though he later backed off that view, Auerbach said. Monetary policy offers two basic choices, Auerbach said: Letting the money supply grow, fueling inflation, or keeping the reins tight, which can cause severe recessions. If you're limited from printing money, you'd put a huge number of people out of work, he said. Upshot: Cargill's correct that a dollar now has about 5 percent of the buying power it did in 1913, when the Federal Reserve System was created. That's basic math. Yet while a dollar now buys far less than in 1913, Americans also have far more earning power. And the dollar has generally held its value compared to other countries' currencies. The thrust of Cargill's statement is that the Fed presided over, or caused, that decline in value. In contrast, most experts we spoke with trace the decline to inflation over the years rather than specific actions by the Federal Reserve Bank. Though some Federal Reserve critics echo Cargill's point, such debates are best left to the economic experts who have waged them for decades.

Final Rating: Mostly False  ",Says Washington's reach extends to even telling us what kind of light bulb we can use.,"No duh, Gov. Rick Perry has a thing against things from Washington. His new book, Fed Up! Our Fight to Save America from Washington, brims with what-the-hey statements about whassup in our nation's capital including a declaration that lit us up.Saying there's no end to the reach of Washington, Perry writes that Washington is even telling us what kind of light bulb we can use.We asked Perry for backup on that claim and didn't hear back. Then we launched a search for use-this-bulb regulations.What we found: In 2007, Congress voted to improve the efficiency of light bulbs. President George W. Bush signed into law the Energy Independence and Security Act, which set energy efficiency standards for kinds of incandescent lamps (light bulbs), incandescent reflector lamps (like track lighting in your kitchen), and fluorescent lamps, according to a December 2007 summary by the Congressional Research Service. With a few exceptions, the law also prohibits the U.S Coast Guard from purchasing incandescent light bulbs for use in Coast Guard office buildings.Barack Obama, Bush's successor, promised while running for president to to sign a measure into law that begins to phase out all incandescent light bulbs. He said the change would save Americans $6 billion a year on their electric bills. Last year, PolitiFact reported that no such proposal was made it into law, though in June 2009 Obama announced changes in lighting standards. Starting in August 2012, fluorescent tube lamps (most commonly found in offices and stores) and conventional incandescent reflector lamps must become more efficient. The government said such fluorescent and incandescent lamps represented approximately 38 percent and 7 percent, respectively, of total lighting energy use.Our search for instances of the government directing which bulbs residents can use unearthed a June 2010 editorial in the Washington Times objecting to Federal Trade Commission-issued regulations of light-bulb labels. The editorial says the regs were ordered by Congress as part of its 2007 decision to force the more efficient, curlicue-shaped compact fluorescent light bulb on a public that so far has refused to embrace it willingly. Beginning Jan. 1, 2012, the editorial says, bureaucratic rules will phase in, and conventional 100-watt bulbs will be first on the contraband list.Make sense?Jen Stutsman, spokeswoman for the U.S. Department of Energy, told us that conventional incandescent bulbs are not expected to meet the efficiency standards Congress set, though the government expects manufacturers to improve incandescent technologies to meet the higher standards or consumers will move to compact fluorescent light bulbs, LED technologies or halogens. She said new standards for 100-watt bulbs take effect in January 2012. New standards for 75-watt bulbs start in 2013 and standards for 60- and 40-watt bulbs start in 2014.Stutsman said the expected shifts aren't equivalent to the government telling Americans which light bulbs to use. Under no circumstances does it say that a consumer must purchase a specific type of light bulb, Stutsman said.Finally, we sought advice from the Dallas-based American Lighting Association, a trade group whose director of engineering and technology, Terry McGowan, said in an e-mail that it's a stretch to say federal laws are telling us what light bulb to buy. Federal law is requiring that household light bulbs be made more efficient in steps over time as a nationwide energy-saving measure. It's like saying that new cars will have to deliver more miles/gallon. Maybe some people would say that's mandating what kind of car to buy; but that's an interpretation — especially if many cars on the market can meet the miles/gallon requirement, McGowan said.There will still be household light bulbs available, McGowan's e-mail says, noting later that special-purpose bulbs used in appliances or for decorative purposes are exempted. One thing is for sure; what we use for lighting our homes will take some thought — and maybe we'll be changing what we decide to do.So, is Washington telling us what kind of bulb to use?Not yet, though the 2007 law steps up efficiency requirements and that's expected to result in consumers purchasing and using different bulbs. These factors give Perry's statement an element of truth. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published.

Final Rating: Mostly True  ",SaySean Hannity said in 2008 that Obamas willingness to meet with North Korea was disturbingwhile Trumps willingness to meet with North Korea is a huge foreign policy win.,"An image shared widely on Facebook and Reddit chides Fox News host Sean Hannity for having a double standard on presidents talking to North Korea. It says that in 2008 Hannity said that President Barack Obamas willingness to meet with North Korea is one of the most disturbing displays of Obamas lack of foreign policy experience. But in 2018, Hannity said President Donald Trumps willingness to meet with North Korea is a huge foreign policy win.  We hit the transcripts and video files. For the most part, those words accurately reflect what Hannity said. A week before Election Day 2008, Hannity gave 10 reasons not to vote for Obama. No. 2 on his list concerned talking to unfriendly regimes. One of the most disturbing displays of Obama's lack of foreign policy expertise came during last year's YouTube debate, Hannity said Oct. 26, 2008. The junior senator from Illinois gave what many called a naive answer for a question from the audience about whether he would meet with the leaders of Syria, Venezuela, Cuba or North Korea without preconditions. Asked during that debate if he would be willing to meet with those leaders without preconditions, Obama said I would, and compared that to previous presidents. Ronald Reagan and Democratic presidents like JFK constantly spoke to the Soviet Union at a time when Ronald Reagan called them an evil empire, Obama said. And the reason is because they understood that we may not trust them and they may pose an extraordinary danger to this country, but we had the obligation to find areas where we can potentially move forward. The image mentioned only North Korea, while Hannity listed several countries. When news broke that Trump was open to meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, Hannity voiced support. A huge foreign policy win for President Trump, Hannity said March 8. Little Rocket Man blinks. Now, the presidents tough rhetoric, his bold action, his severe sanctions, they appear to be working tonight. President Trump is accepting an invitation to meet with the North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un by May, and Pyongyang is agreeing to stop all nuclear and missile tests while these talks are underway. And the sanctions? They will continue. So the text in the image matches what Hannity said. But his criticism of Obama and his praise for Trump came in the context of different policies. Obamas policy on North Korea grew more complicated over time. But initially, it was fairly simple, said Penn State international affairs professor Joseph DeThomas. Preconditions meant that in order for talks to happen, North Korea had to agree that the purpose was the complete denuclearization of North Korea. During the campaign and early in his term Obama was very open to talks without preconditions, DeThomas said. For Trump, the picture is murkier. When Trump tweeted that he would meet with Kim Jong Un, North Korea had not taken any steps toward denuclearization. He said they had talked about it. Kim Jong Un talked about denuclearization with the South Korean representatives, not just a freeze, Trump wrote. Also, no missile testing by North Korea during this period of time. Kim Jong Un talked about denuclearization with the South Korean Representatives, not just a freeze. Also, no missile testing by North Korea during this period of time. Great progress being made but sanctions will remain until an agreement is reached. Meeting being planned! But for North Korea, denuclearization applies to the entire peninsula, which has implications for the American presence and military posture in South Korea. That is not the same as simply agreeing to a North Korea without nukes. DeThomas said testing halts are customary during talks with North Korea. Beyond that, North Korea made no concessions or took any steps toward ending its nuclear program. Trump has imposed stricter sanctions and has been more ready to hint at using military force against North Korea. But in terms of having direct talks between the leaders of both nations, DeThomas said this administration set a lower bar than what previous presidents have demanded. The Trump precondition for talks was that North Korea had to halt nuclear and missile testing for some unspecified period of time prior to commencement of talks, DeThomas said.  In February, Vice President Mike Pence drew headlines when he said sanctions and direct talks could happen at the same time. To some observers, that meant the administration was willing to talk without the precondition of North Korea agreeing to a future free of nukes. DeThomas characterized such words as loosey goosey, but not indicative of a major change. In that regard, when Hannity praised Trump, the administrations overall policy was tougher than what Obama had articulated when he ran for president. But the fact remains that Trump had agreed to a meeting before North Korea had taken any concrete steps toward ridding itself of nuclear weapons. The side-by-side quotes cast Hannity as criticizing Obama for being willing to talk to North Korea while praising Trump for his willingness to do the same thing. The quotations are pretty much accurate. But the image glosses over the different policy preferences of each man at the time Hannity spoke. In 2008, Obama said simply there were no preconditions for a meeting with the leader. In 2018, Trumps administration voiced some relaxation on preconditions, but not a full rejection of them. At the same time, Trump agreed to a meeting before North Korea had done more than agree to hold off on testing during any talks.",1.0,0.5,1.0,0.8,0.3,0.4,0.6,1.0,0.5,mostly-true

Final Rating: Mostly True  ","For every one mile of light-rail track that will be built, 16 miles of new road capacity will be built.","One main criticism about the proposed list of projects aimed at improving transportation throughout the Atlanta region is it doesnt have enough new rail components.In south DeKalb County, some county commissioners and influential leaders have been reluctant to support a 1 percent sales tax to fund the projects because the plan doesnt extend MARTA rail service to the area.The environmentally conscious Georgia Sierra Club went a step further recently when it announced its opposition to the July 31 referendum on the tax. One claim the organizations director made as part of her argument against the referendum seemed worthy of a fact-check.For every one mile of light-rail track that will be built, 16 miles of new road capacity will be built, Colleen Kiernan said in a radio interview with WABE-FMs Denis OHayer.Hmmm. Is that correct? Lets take a ride in search of the truth.The list for the 10-county Atlanta region contains 157 projects, according to the Atlanta Regional Commission, which provided data and analysis to officials involved in putting together the list.The Sierra Club sent PolitiFact Georgia a spreadsheet with about 70 projects that would increase the number of lanes of some roads or make them longer. Some of the road projects on the list include: The road projects would increase capacity by 367 miles, ARC says.By comparison, there are three confirmed light-rail projects on the list: along the Atlanta Beltline, the Atlanta streetcar and a line on Clifton Corridor from the Lindbergh Center in Atlanta to Emory University in DeKalb County. A proposed rail line from Cobb County to Midtown Atlanta would need federal funding and is not currently considered a light-rail project.The referendums supporters say the lack of light or heavy rail in the plan is not a lack of will, but a matter of math. The light rail on the Beltline and Clifton Corridor is expected to cost about $1.3 billion, or about $60 million a mile. The referendum is projected to raise about $8.5 billion over the life span of the tax, 10 years.Jane Hayse, ARCs transportation division chief, said the light-rail projects are 21 miles combined.So what about the Sierra Clubs calculation of a 16-to-1 ratio of road projects to light rail? According to ARC, there are 17.5 miles of increased road capacity in the plan for each mile of proposed light rail.Mathematically, it is accurate, Hayse told us. However, the comparison is erroneous. It compares apples to bananas.Hayse said in order to fairly fact-check the Sierra Clubs claim, you must consider all the additional bus projects in the plan. The list includes express bus service in portions of the region and $100 million for bus service in Clayton County, which ended its bus operations a few years ago due to budget cuts. In all, ARC said there is an additional 371 miles of bus service on the list.ARC spokesman Jim Jaquish said the organization will not take a position on the referendum because it is a nonprofit that receives taxpayer dollars. Jaquish did say ARC believes the list is made up of sound, needed projects.Hayse said express bus service is more logical for some parts of the Atlanta suburbs because people do not live and work as closely together as they do in the city. Hayse said rail stations are typically three miles apart, whereas express bus service has longer distances between stops.Light rail just doesnt make sense for the whole region, she said.Kiernan countered that bus service is not a sure thing, noting that Clayton Countys bus service, C-Tran, was discontinued.Our argument is that the amount of fixed, permanent transit infrastructure that we know will be built by the tax is overwhelmed by the amount of fixed road infrastructure we know will be built, Kiernan wrote via email. Traditional express and local bus service is a completely different animal ... and the suggestion that miles of bus service is somehow equivalent to miles of permanent fixed-guideway infrastructure is highly misleading.Kiernans claim is essentially correct. But it needs a bit of context to move higher on the Truth-O-Meter.Under our rating system, Kiernan gets a Mostly True.",1.0,0.5,1.0,0.8,0.0,0.3,0.4,1.0,0.7,mostly-true

Final Rating: Mostly True",Took on the Olympics and turned them around,"In February 1999, Romney was called on to help bail out an Olympic effort that was marred by scandal. Sponsors wondered if they still wanted their names attached to the Games after it was revealed that Salt Lake City's host committee had showered gifts on the international group that had chosen the location. Investigations were underway. The Olympics were in serious trouble. Still, Romney's implication that he single-handedly rescued the Games is a sore subject in Utah. Robert Garff, chairman of the Salt Lake organizing committee and a supporter of Romney's presidential bid, says Romney's commercial does overstate the problem. Garff says that contrary to Romney's ad, the Olympics were not bankrupt before he arrived. In addition, many of the Games' sponsors predated Romney's involvement, said Sydney Fonnesbeck, a former member of the Salt Lake City Council. He just came in and gathered the money that was already (pledged), she said. Fonnesbeck said Romney alienated some people with whom he worked during the Games. He didn't want to give anyone else any credit, she said. We became nobodies. A lot of us were hurt and angry. It didn't surprise any of us when he ran home and ran for governor. And yet, Romney did play a decisive role in righting the troubled Olympics. Richard Pound, a Montreal attorney and a member of the International Olympic Committee, said someone had to take charge and make decisions or the Games would have been a disaster. That's what Romney did. There were good people in the organization, but for them to have been able to do the many things that needed to be done, they needed a good leader who could make decisions and empower them, Pound said. Romney scored a big win early in his effort to preserve the Olympic luster by helping to convince John Hancock to remain a sponsor. Stephen A. Greyser, a professor emeritus at the Harvard Business School and a specialist in sports marketing, said the Olympic brand itself had been at stake. It was Mitt Romney who was, in essence, Mr. Integrity, Greyser said. In the end, we cannot award a fully True ruling to Romney's claim when even his supporters say his claim is a little overstated. But there is nothing to dispute that Romney played a vital role in rescuing a very troubled Olympic games and that's why we're rating his claim Mostly True.",0.7,0.5,0.9,0.5,0.3,0.4,0.6,0.8,0.6,mostly-true

Final Rating: Mostly True  ",Says a Republican-drawn map of proposed U.S. House districts for Texas gerrymanders more than nine million Latinos in Texas to make sure that we have no more electoral opportunity than we did in 1991.,"A lawyer viewing a proposed Republican redo of congressional districts laid out in late May saw no additional gains for Hispanic representation even though 65 percent of the state's growth over the past decade was comprised of Latinos.Nina Perales, vice president of litigation for the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund, said in a May 31 press release that the map just unveiled by Republican legislators gerrymanders more than nine million Latinos in Texas to make sure that we have no more electoral opportunity than we did in 1991.Thats a heavy charge considering Latino population growth has been key to the state gaining six U.S. House seats since the 2000 census.Is MALDEFs claim accurate?Lets start with a dash of law and a 20-year flashback.As noted in a February draft report by the Texas Legislative Council, U.S. Supreme Court decisions bar any state from drawing congressional districts intentionally diluting the voting strength of members of a racial or ethnic minority group.The Voting Rights Act of 1965, amended in 1982, is the most important law protecting the voting rights of racial and ethnic minority groups, the report says, because of provisions requiring certain jurisdictions, including Texas, to obtain prior federal approval of any redistricting plan. The act also allows members of a racial or language minority group to challenge a plan limiting or diminishing their opportunity to participate in elections and to elect candidates of their choice.Redistricting expert Justin Levitt, a professor at Loyola Law School, told us the court has interpreted the act to mean jurisdictions must protect the voting power of a group of racial and ethnic minorities if its large enough, compact enough and cohesive enough--and would not be able to exercise political power if the electoral process was left to its own devices.Now, the flashback: Lawmakers in 1991 designed two of three added House districts as opportunity districts giving Latino voters a good shot at electing candidates of their choice. Frank Tejeda, a Democratic state senator, then captured the San Antonio-rooted 28th district, while voters in Houstons 29th district advanced another senator, Democrat Gene Green.Texas wound up with seven Latino-opportunity districts, a number that did not change after last decades redistricting.How do those opportunity districts shake out under the map offered in May?For starters, the map breaks up the state into 36 districts, counting four districts gained courtesy of population increases this past decade. Two new districts, one in the Houston area, the other in Dallas-Fort Worth, are not considered minority-opportunity districts.Another, the 34th district, stretches from Brownsville in Cameron County to Hidalgo County north toward Corpus Christi and is 82 percent Hispanic. But observers do not view the district as a Latino-opportunity gain; its a swap for the current Latino-opportunity district rooted in Corpus Christi and carried in 2010 by Republican Blake Farenthold.Then again, the remap includes the new 35th district running from East Austin into San Antonio. Its overall population is 63 percent Hispanic, according to information compiled by the legislative council; 45 percent of its 2010 registered voters had Spanish surnames. Perales told us Latino voters could elect the candidate of their choice in the district.This appears to give the state an additional Latino-opportunity district compared with 1991.Not so, Perales said, because its offset by redraws of San Antonios 20th district and the 23rd district stretching west from San Antonio that dilute Latino voting power.Among factors she aired: The share of Spanish-surnamed voters in the 20th district, which is represented by Charlie Gonzalez, would drop from 58 percent now to 49 percent. In the 23rd district, where Democrat Rick Noriega bested GOP U.S. Sen. John Cornyn in 2008, Cornyn prevails in the redrawn version.If you create a new opportunity and you take away an opportunity, theres no net gain, Perales said.State Sen. Kel Seliger, R-Amarillo, who chairs the Senate Redistricting Committee, told us lawmakers had to shift Hispanic residents from Gonzalezs district to ensure the new Austin-to-San Antonio district would be a Latino-opportunity district. He urged us to visit further with Austin lawyer Bob Heath, an adviser to the committee.Heath said its hard for legislators to create more Latino-opportunity districts because the Hispanic population is younger than the rest of Texas, and its proportionate share of voting-age residents is smaller. He said too that such residents arent always geographically concentrated and Latino voter registration and turnout tends to run low in part because there are more Latino non-citizens than in other subgroups.Heath said that in his opinion, he said, the 20th district is always going to elect an Hispanic in the Democratic primary and the Democrat is going to win. He declined to comment on the 23rd district.No doubt, appraising opportunity districts is tricky. This is why political scientists get paid every 10 years, for taking all the factors into account and judging districts, Levitt said. Its nuanced.Its also subject to legal argument. Courts have been asked to judge the redo of congressional districts that ultimately won legislative approval.Our judgment: If MALDEFs characterizations stick, the May remap promised six to seven Latino-opportunity districts -- at best the same as 1991.But if Republican defenders are correct, the remap offers eight Latino-opportunity districts--a one-seat bump. However, the proportion of Latino-opportunity seats circa 2012--22 percent--would be virtually unchanged in 20 years. Thats because greatly Latino population growth has helped Texas edge to 36 total seats, compared to 30 in 1991.",0.8,0.5,0.9,0.6,0.5,0.4,0.5,0.7,0.6,mostly-true

Final Rating: Mostly True  ",Almost 75 percent of the deaths from COVID-19 in the state of Texas are a result of people contracting COVID-19 who are age 65 and older.,"In a press conference on May 5 in which Gov. Greg Abbott updated his reopening plan to add businesses such as hair salons and gyms, he recommended that at-risk populations remain at home if at all possible and avoid in-person gatherings, such as a church service, funeral or wedding. We strongly encourage at-risk populations to try to watch or participate remotely, remembering this very important point, and that is almost 75 percent of the deaths from COVID-19 in the state of Texas are a result of people contracting COVID-19 who are age 65 and older, Abbott said. Texas was among the first states to start reopening businesses and lifting restrictions put in place to curb the spread of the coronavirus, allowing retail stores and restaurants to open May 1 at 25 percent capacity. Abbott announced the latest set of reopenings Monday, expanding restaurant capacity to 50 percent and granting bars the ability to open at 25 percent capacity within the next couple weeks. This comes as the state continues to see its number of infections and deaths rise and clusters form mostly in rural parts of the state where meatpacking plants are located. Hospitalizations, however, have decreased since mid-April. With that in mind, we had to ask: Is Abbott right that almost 75% of coronavirus deaths in Texas are people older than 65? Looking at the numbers Abbotts spokesman John Wittman said Abbotts claim is based on figures from the Texas Department of Health Services, which publishes daily numbers on the states COVID-19 testing and cases. The data includes a breakdown of coronavirus deaths by age, race and gender, but only for those cases where the deaths have been investigated by the local and regional health departments. As of Wednesday, the majority, or 489, were still under investigation. The demographic data on cases and fatalities come from the case investigation forms submitted by local health departments and our regional offices, said DSHS spokesman Chris Van Deusen. The purpose of the investigation is to confirm that the person had COVID-19 but also to collect other details about them and the circumstances around their death, Van Deusen said. Wittman said the data showed that 75% of investigated deaths were people 65 and older when Abbott made this statement. It alternates almost daily, but its generally around that range, Wittman said. As of May 6, the day after the press conference, the death toll in Texas was 948. Fewer than half, or 433, had been investigated. Of those, about 71 percent were Texans 65 and older. It was still about 71 percent, or 345 out of 489 investigated cases, as of Wednesday. The age groups broke down like so: Ages 10 to 19 years old: 2 deaths, or 0.4% Ages 20-29: 10 deaths, or 2.04 % Ages 30-39: 9 deaths, or 1.8% Ages 40-49: 21 deaths, or 4.29% Ages 50-59: 54 deaths, or 11.04% Ages 60-64: 45 deaths, or 9.2% Ages 65-69: 59 deaths, or 12.06% Ages 70-74: 45 deaths, or 9.2% Ages 75-79: 45 deaths, or 9.2% Ages 80+: 196 deaths, or 40.08% Across the United States, about 79% of coronavirus deaths have been people 65 years and older, according to the National Center for Health Statistics data submitted between the beginning of February to the beginning of May. Like Texas statistics, the national numbers are also incomplete. The number of deaths represent only those entered between those dates and only include people with confirmed or presumed COVID-19. While 80% of deaths are electronically processed and coded by NCHS within minutes, most deaths from COVID-19 must be coded by a person, which takes an average of 7 days, the NCHS states on its website. The data is also always somewhat behind because of the lag time between when a death occurred and when a death certificate is completed, submitted to NCHS and processed for reporting purposes. The delay can last anywhere from one week to eight or more. Our ruling Abbott said almost 75 percent of the deaths from COVID-19 in the state of Texas are a result of people contracting COVID-19 who are age 65 and older. Of confirmed coronavirus deaths, close to 75% were people within the age group Abbott provided, but he failed to include the caveat that this statistic leaves out more than half of the total deaths that have not yet been investigated.",0.8,0.4,1.0,0.6,0.0,0.2,0.5,1.0,0.4,mostly-true

Final Rating: Mostly True  ","At Twin River, we're more than competitive with nearby casinos in slot machine payouts.","Earlier this month, Gov. Lincoln Chafee expressed the fear that trying to cull too much revenue from the state's slot parlors could send gamblers to other states, where the odds might be better.They are not going to play if they are going to keep losing, Chafee said. They'll go across the border, or go somewhere else where the odds, if you will, are more in their favor.  They know where they have a better chance of winning.In response, Patti Doyle, spokeswoman for Twin River, one of Rhode Islands two slot parlors, said in a radio interview that her casino gives better odds.We know from the industry standards in the industry casino world, that we're all pretty much on the same level. You know, you wouldn't be able to continue to be in business if you weren't competitive with gaming venues that are nearby. And we are. We're more than competitive, she said on radio station WPRO (630-AM).When we hear more than competitive, we think better.So we asked Doyle for the source of that comparison. While we awaited her response, we started our own research.On its website, RILot.com, the Rhode Island Lottery publishes a monthly list of how much cash was put into Twin Rivers 4,700 slot machines, how much cash was won, and how much that represents in percentage.(It should be noted that neither Twin River, nor Newport Grand, the states other slot parlor, sets the payout percentages of their slot machines. Theyre set by the director of the Rhode Island Lottery, Gerald S. Aubin.)Statistics for Connecticut's two casinos -- Foxwoods Resort Casino and Mohegan Sun -- are on the website of the Connecticut Division of Special Revenue at CT.gov/DOSR.At first glance, it looks like Rhode Island is less than competitive. During the period from January 2010 through January 2011, the highest monthly Twin River payout to gamblers was 91.529 percent, in December. The highest payout percentage at the Newport Grand, was lower: 91.171 percent in September.In contrast, the payouts at Foxwoods are listed as higher for 11 of the last 12 months. And Mohegan Sun offered a bigger payout every month, going no lower than 91.80 percent last May and as high as 92.17 in August.But George Papanier, CEO of Twin River, said the published percentages aren't comparable because states calculate the payout percentage differently.The issue is the credits that players get, also known as free play. Rhode Island calls it Bonus Play. Mohegan lists it as eBonus Credits. In the Foxwoods report it's called Free Play. The two states account for it differently, said Papanier. Officials at the Rhode Island Lottery told us the same thing.As a result, the payout percentage for Foxwoods and Mohegan Sun is inflated, they said.In order to calculate the Cash Won at each Connecticut casino the same way it is calculated in Rhode Island, you must take the handle  (the amount played, including free play and winnings replayed), subtract the Win amount (how much the casino wins) and subtract the value of the Free Play or eBonus coupons redeemed at the slot machines.By that formula, we discovered that, as Doyle said, Twin Rivers payout percentage is better than Foxwoods. In every month over the past year, Twin River had a higher payout percentage. The one-year averages: 91.366 percent for Twin River and 90.768 percent for Foxwoods.The story is a little different for Mohegan Sun. It beat out Twin River in 7 of the past 12 months, but the Connecticut casino's 12-month average was a hair below Twin River's, at 91.359 percent. A few tenths -- or hundredths -- of a percent may not seem consequential, but to serious gamblers, any tilt in their advantage is attractive, maybe even enough to send them to one casino over another.To double-check our numbers, we talked to Michael Janusko, chief financial examiner of Connecticut's Division of Special Revenue, who confirmed that our calculations were correct. The way Foxwoods and Mohegan Sun run their numbers, it does overstate the payout percentage a bit, he said.Finally, Doyle sent us a copy of The Gaming Industry Observer's East Coast Slot Report that summarizes casino operations from Maine to Florida in January. Twin River ranked 13th out of 56 facilities in terms of money paid out to players, ahead of Mohegan Sun (25th), Newport Grand (26th), and Foxwoods (35th).Aubin, Rhode Island's Lottery director, said there is an important caveat to understand when considering payout. Those percentages are largely a function of the types of machines a casino has, not whether it is actually giving gamblers better odds.All other things being equal, a facility that has lots of penny slots, for example, will have a lower overall payout percentage than a casino that has none because those machines have smaller payouts.I'm confident it would be the exact same payout throughout the country with the same game, he said.To summarize: Looking at the casinos as a whole, the way Foxwoods and Mohegan Sun calculate their payout percentages may make them look like a better bet for gamblers. But if you include player rewards to make an apples-to-apples comparison, Doyle's statement that Twin River is more than competitive is true for Foxwoods. Whether it applies to Mohegan Sun depends on the month.",1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.5,1.0,1.0,mostly-true

Final Rating: Mostly True  ","Under economic sanctions, now Iran is suffering 30 percent inflation, 20 percent unemployment.","An Iranian president says hes ready to resolve the nations nuclear standoff with the West — what gives? Former U.S. Labor Secretary Robert Reich gives at least partial credit to economic pain orchestrated by the United States and international allies. While the United States must still be very cautious, he said on ABCs This Week, one of the big lessons here is that economic sanctions do seem to work. Right now Iran is suffering 30 percent inflation, 20 percent unemployment, he told a roundtable including CNNs Newt Gingrich, ABCs Jonathan Karl and PBS Gwen Ifill. I mean this nation is hurting and our economic sanctions, because we've been patient with them, because we have actually rounded up almost every other nation to support us, have had a huge impact. Is Iran suffering such high inflation and unemployment under economic sanctions? Tumbling oil exports Now, economic sanctions are nothing new for Iran, which has faced U.S. sanctions since its 1979 Islamic revolution. But the pressure hasbeen rising. Other nations have joined in sanctions since 2006 in response to Irans efforts to develop a nuclear weapon, according to a report byKenneth Katzman of the Congressional Research Service, which provides nonpartisan analysis to Congress. Oil exports, which fund nearly half of Irans government spending, have fallen by about half since 2011, from about 2.5 million barrels a day to about 1.25 million. The drop hasbeen driven, Katzman says, by a European Union embargo and U.S. pressure on Iranian oil customers. Iran also lost access to the international banking system. The combination has caused a sharp drop in the value of Irans currency, the rial, Katzman says. Meanwhile, sanctions helped trigger a recession thats driving up unemployment. Has that meant 30 percent inflation, 20 percent unemployment, as Reich told ABC viewers? Theres not a simple answer. Inflation estimates range from 30 percent to 70 percent. Official unemployment statistics, meanwhile, are out of date, and outside experts question their accuracy, anyway. The International Monetary Fund, World Bank and Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development dont have up-to-date figures for Iranian unemployment. Still, Reichs in range. Gary Hufbauer, a former U.S. Treasury official and senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics who has studied sanctions for 30 years, said Reichs numbers seem reasonable. Heres how the Congressional Research Service put it in June: Inflation: 30 percent plus, according to Iran Central Bank in May 2013, but believed to be over 50 percent by outside experts. Unemployment rate: Official rate is 15.3 percent as of the end of 2011, but outside experts believe the rate is higher. Reich pointed us to news articles from the Associated Press and energy news site OilPrice.com — which offer some support for his numbers while highlighting the uncertainty. The Associated Press reported in June inflation over 30 percent, though it cited a 14 percent unemployment rate. OilPrices.com noted Sept. 19 that analysts outside the countryfound thatunemployment rate impossible to believe, and quoted an estimate from Mehrdad Emadi, an Iranian-born economic adviser to the European Union, of more than 20 percent. (The OilPrices.com report echoes a Reuters report from the same day.) So reasonable seems like a fair assessment for Reichs numbers. We should also note theres not universal agreement on the size of sanctions role in all that financial pain, which experts also attribute to Irans fiscal management. Reich, a professor of public policy at the University of California at Berkeley with a background in economics, told PolitiFact it just makes sense unemployment and inflation would follow a slash in oil exports. The typical consequence for a nation dependent on exports when those exports are cut is high inflation and high unemployment, he said. Michael Malloy, a professor at the University of the Pacifics McGeorge School of Law who specializes in banking regulation and economic sanctions, told PolitiFact it's likely to be a much more complicated picture. Our ruling Reich told ABC viewers that under economic sanctions, now Iran is suffering 30 percent inflation and 20 percent unemployment. Irans own statistics arent widely trusted and international organizations dont have recent unemployment figures. But those numbers fall within a broad range of expert estimates cited by news reports and the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service. Its worth noting that Irans economic struggle has been exacerbated by its own economic policies and other factors, not just sanctions. Still, theres good evidence theyve had a huge impact, as Reich said.",0.8,0.2,1.0,0.7,0.0,0.1,0.5,0.9,0.6,mostly-true

Final Rating: Mostly True  ",U.S. Sen. Johnny Isakson has voted for $7 trillion of our national debt!,"Libertarian U.S. Senate candidate Allen Buckley knows he faces an uphill battle in his campaign to unseat Republican U.S. Sen. Johnny Isakson. Libertarians usually pull only low single-digits of the overall Georgia voter turnout. And Isakson is a veteran lawmaker and a founding member of the state Republican establishment, which today holds sway over all statewide offices. Buckley ran unsuccessful campaigns for U.S. Senate in 2004 and 2008. But in 2008, he won enough votes in the general election to force a runoff between Republican Saxby Chambliss and Democrat Jim Martin. An Atlanta tax attorney, Buckley thinks he has an issue that will resonate with voters if he can only get them to pay attention and understand the gravitas of the soaring federal debt. U.S. Sen. Johnny Isakson has voted for $7 trillion of our national debt! Buckley states on his website as part of a graphic about Isakson votes to raise the federal debt limit. Is that possible? Has Isakson, who has pushed for a balanced budget amendment and who also blasts the federal debt on his campaign website, actually assisted the spending spree? PolitiFact Georgia decided to take a look. Buckley and Democrat Jim Barksdale will face Isakson in the November election. We first contacted Buckley, who said the graphic refers to Isaksons repeated votes to raise the federal debt limit, which essentially means raising the cap on what the government is permitted to spend to pay the bills. I believe Mr. Isakson has, irresponsibly and immorally, voted to grow the federal government through debt spending to the detriment of young people and our country. Buckley said in an email. He later added: He largely created the mess and then voted to fund what he created. Buckley said Isakson voted for debt-bloating items like the war in Iraq and the Medicare prescription drug benefit and subsequently voted for debt-ceiling increases to cover the cost of the increased spending. Isaksons campaign manager, Trey Kilpatrick, dismissed Buckley assertions, but did not dispute Isaksons vote to raise the debt limit. Mr. Buckley is trying to mislead voters by citing debt ceiling votes (required for solvency) without citing Johnny's votes against trillions of dollars in unnecessary spending, including voting against a minimum of $5 trillion in debt ceiling votes alone, or his vote for the Budget Control Act, which cut spending by over $2 trillion and, according to the Heritage Foundation, 'has shrunk the size of government more effectively than any budget tool in a generation, Kilpatrick wrote in an email. The debate over the federal debt comes at an interesting time. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office earlier this month released a report that warned of vastly increased federal debt when compared to the Gross Domestic Product over the next three decades. Federal debt held by the public was 39 percent of GDP in 2008, but is now about 75 percent, the budget office said. That could rise to 86 percent by 2026 and a whopping 141 percent by 2046. The prospect of such large debt poses substantial risks for the nation and presents policymakers with significant challenges, the budget office warned. The CBO said the governments spending growth is outpacing revenues as spending soars for popular programs like Social Security and Medicare and interest on the governments existing debt. The most popular programs cost a lot to maintain, and neither Democrats nor Republicans want to be blamed for cuts, experts told PolitiFact. PolitiFact consulted political and budget experts across the county. Their verdict: Buckley has a point about Isaksons spending votes, but there is a lot of context missing. University of Virginia political scientist Larry Sabato said many of the most popular federal programs are also the most expensive. That puts politicians of all stripes in a difficult spot. Some, like Social Security, Medicare/Medicaid, Defense spending, interest on the debt etc. are bigger than others, Sabato said. Given that many of these categories are mandatory, its hard to imagine that any member of Congress hasnt cast votes that effectively increase the amount of debt the country incurs. Chris Edwards, an economist with the Cato Institute, said that by voting for debt-limit increases members of Congress have kicked the can down the road on the governments debt problem. Voting for annual deficit-financed budgets causes the accumulated debt to rise, but voting to increase the legal debt limit—as Isakson and others do regularly—ratifies the unsound practice of endlessly spending more than is taken in, Edwards wrote in an email. Kennesaw State University political scientist Kerwin Swint said voting to raise the debt ceiling is not quite the same thing as voting to create new programs or authorize new spending items The alternative to not raising the debt ceiling is shutting down the government, Swint said. Buckleys claim is technically accurate of course but totally misleading, saidAlan Abramowitz, a political scientist at Emory University. Abramowitz said the U.S. should take advantage of extremely low interest rates to borrow more money to invest in much needed infrastructure improvements and other projects. It cannot be emphasized enough that the debt obsession of some conservative politicians and pundits is totally misplaced at a time when the investing community is practically begging to purchase U.S. treasury notes at extremely low interest rates, Abramowitz said.  Our ruling:  Libertarian U.S. Senate candidate Allen Buckley proclaimed on his campaign website: U.S. Sen. Johnny Isakson has voted for $7 trillion of our national debt! Isakson did indeed vote to raise the debt ceiling, so Buckley has a valid point. But the alternative would be risking a government shutdown. That said, Buckley also pointed at that Isakson voted for some of the very programs that bloated the debt in the first place.  https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/678c89f4-52af-4e46-a0c6-780d26e73caf",1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,mostly-true

Final Rating: Mostly True  ","Says under our current sentencing laws, about 75 percent of all convicted felons in Oregon do not go to prison.","Gov. John Kitzhaber recently announced the creation of a new commission to examine the states sentencing laws. Not long after, two advocacy groups released a joint report calling Oregon's Measure 11 ineffective and discriminatory when it comes to the states youth.Mandatory sentencing laws -- ever the point of contention -- are receiving renewed public attention. And in a recent guest column in The Oregonian, three county district attorneys -- including Multnomahs Michael Schrunk -- offered some context, noting this is an issue with which we have great experience and expertise.While expressing some disappointment that the governor was not including elected district attorneys on the commission, the three wrote contrary to popular belief, we do not lock up every convicted criminal. Under our current sentencing laws, about 75 percent of all convicted felons in Oregon do not go to prison. They are put on probation in the community.That statistic caught the eye of at least one reader who asked PolitiFact Oregon to take a look.The DAs said they got that figure courtesy of Oregons Criminal Justice Commission, so thats where we started.It didnt take long before Michael Wilson, the commissions economist, sent us a breakdown of felons and their sentences for 2010.At first blush, it looks like Schrunk and the other DAs -- John Foote of Clackamas and Bob Hermann of Washington -- were right. (It should be noted, nine others endorsed the letter, as well.) Of the 17,622 convicted felons in 2010, just over 4,000 were sent to prison. As a percentage, thats about 23 percent.But, as Craig Prins, the director of the justice commission put it, the simple answer isnt always the most informative answer. There are a few caveats to consider before you go shouting that number from any rooftops.For starters, that 23 percent figure doesnt include the 8 percent of felons who serve state time, but do it in local jails. Those 8 percent serve less than a year, but its still worth noting. Take that into account and at least 30 percent are serving state time -- just not necessarily in a prison.Next, it should be noted that there are different categories of felonies, and as you drill down into them, you start to notice that certain sorts of felons are more likely to receive time in a prison.Of the felons convicted of person crimes (think: robberies, assaults, sex crimes, murder and others), 43 percent go to prison, and another 3 percent spent time in a local jail. For felons convicted of property crimes, 30 percent wind up in prison and another 5 percent in local jails.The overall figure gets pushed down some by drug offenders who are sentenced to prison at a rate close to 8 percent with another 10 percent going to local jails for less than a year. The national rate for the same group is considerably higher, Prins said. In 2006, for instance, nationally drug offenders were being sent to prison about 40 percent of the time, according to a report from the Bureau of Justice Statistics.In Oregon, weve always kind of prided ourselves on the fact that, policy-wise, it does not make sense to put such people in prison, Prins said. Same goes for people who commit lower-level property crimes. Is it worth spending $30,000 to incarcerate somebody who stole $1,000? Prins asked. The priority are those who commit violent crimes.And, indeed, if you exclude drug offenders from the equation, 33 percent of convicted felons serve time in prison while 7 percent serve time in local jails for a total closer to 40 percent.Thats not to say that drug offenses arent felonies -- but its still important context, especially given that the word felony can describe a number of crimes.Theres one last bit to consider: About 69 percent of all convicted felons wind up with probation. But that doesnt mean they get off without serving any time behind bars, which seems to be an implicit part of the DAs critique when they note contrary to popular belief, we do not lock up every convicted criminal.According to Wilson, about 63 percent of the offenders who received a probation sentence in 2010 received a jail sentence as well. The average stay, he said, was just over a month.Put another way, only 25 percent of convicted felons actually manage to avoid time behind bars as part of their sentence. Even then, Charles French, a deputy district attorney with Multnomah County who deals a lot with crime statistics, said hed be surprised if those 25 percent dont serve at least some time in jail, if even a night, after their arrest.I think most people who commit felonies do serve time in jail, he said. But most of them do not serve time in prison. And, frankly, the idea of a jail sanction as a condition of probation is reformatory, in theory.Its important, he added, that the public has access to these sorts of figures, even if they require some context. I think the more information the public has, the better.As for our ruling, the DAs were very specific in their statement that 75 percent of all convicted felons in Oregon do not go to prison. Technically theyre right, but the number of felons the DAs lock up is considerable higher and thats an important piece of missing context. Well give this one a Mostly True.",1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,mostly-true

Final Rating: Mostly True  ",Manufacturing wages today in America on a per-hour basis are actually a bit lower than average wages in the economy as a whole.,"Former car czar Steven Rattner, who actually hates the nickname he earned overseeing the auto bailout, is pushing back against proclamations of a flourishing American manufacturing industry. Again. Rattner wrote an eye-catching New York Times op-ed in January calling the industrys post-recession jobs gains a trickle, arguing we need to get real about the so-called renaissance partly because wages for auto workers andmanufacturersdropped far more than the average private-sector worker since the end of the recession in June 2009. He revisited some of those points in a March 30, 2014, appearance on ABCs This Week, which took a break from coverage of Russia and the missing Malaysian plane to examine the state of Made in the USA. We certainly want these kinds of advanced manufacturing jobs. But remember this, manufacturing wages today in America on a per-hour basis are actually a bit lower than average wages in the economy as a whole, he said. And what I mean by that is there are lots of really good high-paying jobs in sectors like education, like IT, like health care, service sectors that are not just entry-level jobs, they are really high-paying jobs, and this is our competitive advantage. Manufacturing jobs are typically seen as a source of higher pay for people who dont earn college degrees, and President Barack Obama put an emphasis on them in his State of the Union address. So PunditFact wondered if Rattner is right: Are per-hour wages in manufacturing a little smaller than average wages for the rest of the American economy? Rattner pointed to U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics data for average hourly earnings of production and nonsupervisory employees in the private sector, which make up about four-fifths of total private-sector employment. The most recent data for February 2014 shows the average hourly private-sector wage was $20.50. The manufacturing industry average was, as Rattner said, a bit lower at $19.43. Hourly wages are almost $3 higher for employees who produce durable goods, such as cars, phones and computers, than those who make nondurable goods, or things like food, gas and clothes. Weekly wages tell a different story, with manufacturers earning almost $122 more a week than the total worker average in February. The reason for the discrepancy between hourly and weekly wages is simple: Manufacturers work more hours. Anyone can work more hours and make more money, Rattner said. But manufacturers also earn more money an hour when you factor in supervisors. BLS data for February show average hourly earnings are $24.31 for all private-sector employees and $24.72 for manufacturing employees -- the opposite of what Rattner said. Which dataset is better? The question can incite an economists quarrel. Dean Baker, a liberal economist and co-director of the Center for Economic Policy Research, took issue with isolating a dataset that excludes supervisors, saying analysts see the distinction as arbitrary and are increasingly using the whole workforce for their research. The manufacturing industry has a lower percentage of production employees (70.1 percent) than the average for the private-sector workforce (82.7 percent), which accounts for the higher pay when usingRattner's measure, Baker said. Rattner argues viewing the data his way is more representative of the typical workers earnings without being influenced by the top of the pay scale. Another liberal economist and former Obama administration adviser, Jared Bernstein of the Center for Budget Policies and Priorities, faulted Rattner for excluding benefits on top of wages. Manufacturing workers often have benefits, he said. Another BLS source for wage data (yes, there are a lot of them) shows that when looking at total compensation (wages plus benefits), manufacturing workers earn $35.14 an hour, which is higher than the $28.44 average for careers in the service-providing industry and $29.63 for all private-sector workers in December 2013. Since it's widely believed that workers trade off benefit pay for lower wages, it's a mistake to just consider wages in this sort of comparison when you're dealing with an industry that pays benefits (as opposed to say, fast food), Bernstein said. Matthew Lavoie, National Association of Manufacturers spokesman, said 97 percent of the groups 12,000 members provide health insurance. Rattner conceded manufacturers earn more than service-industry workers when benefits are included in his New York Times column. In our interview with Rattner, he anticipated these objections to his claim. But my point remains the same: The perception that manufacturing jobs are better jobs is out of date, Rattner wrote. Note also that over the past year, per-hour wages for all industries rose by 50 cents per hour but in manufacturing, they rose by only 21 cents per hour. The trend is not manufacturing's friend, as my NYT piece pointed out. Our ruling Rattner was careful on This Week to single out data for per-hour wages when he argued manufacturers are not paid as much as the rest of workforce. His claim relies on the most recent data for production workers in the manufacturing industry, who earn about $1 less than the average of their private-sector counterparts. However, factoring in supervisors shows manufacturers make 41 cents more per hour. Adding benefits gives manufacturers more of an edge. We wont take sides and say what dataset we think is best. What we can say is that Rattner makes an accurate point by one measure.",0.8,0.3,1.0,0.7,0.1,0.4,0.5,1.0,0.6,mostly-true

Final Rating: Mostly True  ",Scott Walker cut school funding more per student than any governor in America.,"A TV ad released Aug. 28, 2014 by the Greater Wisconsin Committee, a group funded by labor unions and Democratic ideological groups, starts with three children looking into the camera and each asking: Why? Then an adult narrator says: Why did Scott Walker cut school funding more per student than any governor in America? Where did the money go? To Scott Walker's friends. Walker gave his corporate friends half a billion dollars in tax breaks and giveaways. We've already rated False an earlier Greater Wisconsin Committee claim, that Walker gave $570 million in job-development incentives to his cronies or corporate friends. Much of that money went to firms whose employees have given to Democrats in the past, many of the donations were small and Walkers jobs agency has a limited role in dealing with firms associated with a big chunk of the $570 million. But what about the claim of Walker cutting school funding, on a per-student basis, more than any other governor? What we know There's no dispute that shortly after taking office in January 2011, Walker made a dramatic reduction in school funding. The $1.2 billion in reductions included $792 million in direct state aid to kindergarten-through-12th grade schools, which is the focus of the new Greater Wisconsin Committee ad. But that fact-check didn't calculate the K-12 school cuts on a per-student basis in comparison to other states. And Walker later restored some of the state aid to schools. The committees evidence Before we dig in, a few words about wording. The Greater Wisconsin Committees claim refers to funding of public schools. But, as well see, the evidence the committee cites is overall spending by the schools -- in other words, what was spent in total from state, federal and local money. So, in addition to checking the overall spending figures the committee cited to us in support of its claim, well examine state revenue figures -- the amount of money given to public schools strictly from the state. What the Greater Wisconsin Committee cited is a table from a solid source, the latest annual report from the U.S. Census Bureau comparing all 50 states (and the District of Columbia) on public school financing. Issued in May 2014, the report covers the Wisconsin state fiscal year of 2011-12, which is the first full fiscal year during Walkers term in office. (The states fiscal year runs from July 1 through June 30; in other words, roughly the same as the traditional school year.) On a percentage basis, Wisconsins reduction in overall per-pupil spending -- of state, federal and local money -- was at the top of the chart when compared with the previous year. In terms of cuts, here are the top five:  State/District Per-pupil SPENDING in 2011-12 from ALL sources Change from 2010-11  Wisconsin $11,042 -6.2 percent Florida $8,372 -5.8 percent District of Columbia $17,468 -5.4 percent Texas $8,261 -4.7 percent South Dakota $8,446 -4.1 percent  In contrast, the census report shows that in the four years before Walker took office, Wisconsins per-student spending rose -- by 3.6 percent in 2010-11, 2.6 percent in 2009-10, 3.7 percent in 2008-09 and 4 percent in 2007-08. In terms of blaming Walker for the cuts, the governor, along with the Republican-controlled Legislature, had direct control over state money, which amounted to 48 percent of the spending by Wisconsin schools in 2011-12. Through the Act 10 collective bargaining reform law, Walker and the Legislature required employees to pay more toward their pension and enabled school districts to charge employees more for health insurance as a way to offset some of the state aid cuts. But as we noted in rating the biggest cuts in state history claim, the Greater Wisconsin Committees statement was not about net impact, just the state funding side of the equation. Walker and the Legislature also had significant influence over local funding, which amounted to 44 percent of the schools spending, because they essentially froze the amount of property tax revenue that local school districts could raise. Walker had no real control over federal funding, which amounted to 8 percent of total spending by Wisconsin schools. Other measures Now, using the same census report, lets look at the revenue figures, focusing on how much state money went to Wisconsin schools. Once again, Wisconsin was at the top in terms of cuts.  State Per-pupil REVENUE in 2011-12 from STATE GOVERNMENT Change from 2010-11  Wisconsin  $5,544 -8.33 percent Idaho $4,630 -6.79 percent Arizona $3,018 -6.46 percent Wyoming $9,466 -5.05 percent Florida $3,273 -4.84 percent  So, the state revenue measure also supports the Greater Wisconsin Committee claim. But there some newer figures available. A May 2014 report from the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a liberal think tank in Washington, D.C., examined state funding of schools in 2013-14. Those figures show Wisconsin was among 15 states that reduced state per-student spending from the previous year. Wisconsin's 0.6 percent reduction (adjusted for inflation) wasnt the largest cut, but rather the third-smallest. (Alaskas 3.2 percent cut was the largest.) Wisconsin state funding was $5,747 per student in 2013-14, versus $5,783 the previous year. As for comparing states on school funding for the entirety of Walkers term, those figures simply arent available yet. Our rating The Greater Wisconsin Committee said: Scott Walker cut school funding more per student than any governor in America. Based on the latest census figures, for 2011-12, the Wisconsin cuts were the largest based on two measures -- state revenue provided to local schools and overall spending by schools of state, federal and local money. But more recent figures indicate that Wisconsins school spending cuts are no longer the largest, at least for a more recent period.

Bob Barr of Georgia blasted his former party for running up the federal budget deficit during the last eight years. Barr added that he wasn't about to give likely Republican presidential nominee Sen. John McCain any reprieve merely because the Arizona senator is a longtime opponent of so-called pork barrel spending. Opposition to earmarks – line items in the federal budget directed to local and state projects – while a positive, isn't enough, says Barr. Eliminating earmarks would make barely a drop in the bucket with regard to the national debt, the deficit, he said after announcing his candidacy at the National Press Club in Washington. As it turns out, Barr's right on the money about how little earmarks have contributed to expanding the national debt. While earmarking has become an easy focal point for fiscal conservatives concerned about the budget deficit, which is now more than $9-trillion in total, having added another $163-billion plus interest in 2007, it's only a small part of the problem. According to an Office of Management and Budget tally, earmarks totaled $17-billion in fiscal 2007, only about 10 percent of the deficit that year. Admittedly, that's after earmarking dropped considerably following the congressional lobbying scandals of 2005 and 2006. But even at their peak in 2005, when earmarks hit $52-billion, according to the Congressional Research Service and the OMB, that was only 16 percent of that year's deficit of $318-billion. Whether Barr's statement is true or not, then, depends on how you define drop in the bucket. We'd say that Barr's pretty much correct, so we grade his statement Mostly True.

Final Rating: Mostly True  ","The Seminole gambling compact offers $3 billion in guaranteed revenue, the largest share for any state in history.","The Seminole Tribe of Florida is trying to convince the Legislature that approving a new gaming compact is a safe bet. As lawmakers consider a plan negotiated between the Seminoles and Gov. Rick Scott, the tribe has started running commercials with the message that the agreement helps the state. One of the ads ticks off several benefits of the deal Scott has touted to the Legislature, which has been reluctant to agree to the compact. The governor authorized a new and unprecedented Seminole compact: Nearly 20,000 new Florida jobs; $3 billion in guaranteed revenue, the largest share for any state in history; and for the first time, empowering the Legislature to limit expansion to keep Florida's entertainment options family friendly, the commercial said. Thats a lot to pack into one 30-second spot. PolitiFact Florida was especially curious about the $3 billion in payments the tribe promised the state. Is it really the most any state has received from Indian gaming in history? It looks like the odds are in the tribes favor. Reaching an agreement This is a very convoluted subject, but heres a quick-start look at the issue: Since 1988, the U.S. government has allowed federally recognized Indian tribes to run gambling establishments on tribal land. But if a tribe wants to have certain Las Vegas-style games at its casino known as Class III games (blackjack, roulette, slot machines and so forth), it must reach a legal agreement with its state, called a compact. The Seminole tribe reached a deal with then-Gov. Charlie Crist in 2010 that allowed them to operate banked card games — games in which players bet against the house instead of each other — at five of its seven casinos across the state. The Seminoles agreed to pay Florida for exclusive rights to operate these games, plus slot machines at four casinos outside Miami-Dade and Broward counties. These revenues usually amounted to well over $200 million per year for the state. The compact expired in July 2015, with a renewal deadline of Oct. 31, 2015. There hasnt been a new agreement, leading to lawsuits between Florida and the Seminoles over who can operate these games. The tribe continues to operate the Class III games of blackjack, chemin de fer and baccarat at those five casinos without a compact. In December 2015, Scott announced he had formed a new compact with the Seminoles. Among the details in the 20-year deal is a promise that the tribe could expand craps and roulette at their casinos and offer blackjack exclusively for seven years. The tribe would guarantee a minimum of $3 billion in payments to the state over those seven years. The Legislature is considering approving the compact during the 2016 session. On Feb. 9, the House Regulatory Affairs Committee okayed a bill to ratify the compact, but the Senate delayed its vote. Is that $3 billion in guaranteed revenue to Florida the most any state has ever gotten, as the Seminoles commercial says? Its the guaranteed part that tips the tribes hand. Comparing compacts Dozens of Indian tribes have gaming compacts in 26 states, and the details differ not only among states, but among tribes in a given state. While tribes can reach agreements to share revenue with local governments and pay regulatory costs, were just looking at how much states get. Comparing these compacts is a tall order. Given the nature of the industry, casinos are always opening and closing, contract terms are being updated or changed, and the terms of the payments tribes give differ depending on the compact. Thats especially true when considering states like Connecticut, whichreceives a lot of money but bases compact payments on a percentage of casino earnings, or Washington, which negotiated compacts so money goes to local governments instead of the state. The Seminoles currently pay the state quite a bit for a single tribe, which we can illustrate with overall earnings and revenue-sharing figures. In California, for example, tribal casinos make about $7 billion per year, highest in the nation. Of that, they give about $241 million to the state in 2014. (The state had compacts with 73 tribes in 2014, but only 11 of those tribes paid into the general revenue fund.) Tribes in Oklahoma, which generated $3.8 billion in gaming revenues from 124 casinos, paid the state about $125 million in 2013. Florida is in third place for total gaming revenues, with more than $2.3 billion from eight casinos. The Seminoles operate seven of those to make the lions share of the revenue, and as we mentioned, more than $200 million of those revenues go to the state annually. (The Miccosukee tribe, which operates an eighth casino in the Miami area, does not need a compact based on the games it offers.) Robert Jarvis, a law professor at Nova Southeastern University in Fort Lauderdale, said the Seminoles can afford to give the state so much because they enjoy several distinct advantages tribes in other states do not. The Seminoles live on land close to population centers, like the Hard Rock casinos in Tampa and Hollywood. They also dont have to fight with other tribes for customers. It doesnt hurt that this is Florida, where tourists flock and bring gambling money with them. These factors affect how the Seminoles have negotiated with the state. The new Seminole compact offers the guaranteed $3 billion in rising increments, from $325 million the first year up to $550 million in the seventh year. There are other provisions and potential payments in the compact, but that $3 billion is money the tribe has promised to pay no matter what. Even though apples-to-apples comparisons are difficult, by that final year the Seminoles would be paying more than the total any other single state gets from all its tribes. The Seminoles are willing to pay out a lot more than other tribes, Jarvis said, because they want exclusivity in a market that the Legislature could open up to other casino developers. The real question here is not the money, which in a budget as big as Floridas really amounts to a rounding error, he said. Its about expanding gambling in Florida. And if youre for that, the question becomes, who do you want to run the casinos, the Seminoles or someone else? Our ruling The Seminole Tribe of Florida said their new gambling compact offers $3 billion in guaranteed revenue, the largest share for any state in history. The tribe's point about guaranteed compensation over seven years holds up when focused on total dollars. But there's no easy way to make apples-to-apples comparisons of the details between various states and their gaming compacts.

Final Rating: Mostly True  ","Says President Donald Trump put out a $297 million contract to a vendor to show him how to hire Border Patrol. So, the first payment they made was $14.8 million. You know how many Border Patrol they hired with $14.8 million? Two.","The Trump administration paid a company millions of dollars to help the government hire Border Patrol agents, but only two agents were employed, claimed U.S. Rep. Henry Cuellar, D-Texas. (President Donald Trump) put out a $297 million contract to a vendor to show him how to hire Border Patrol. So, the first payment they made was $14.8 million. You know how many Border Patrol they hired with $14.8 million? Two,  Cuellar said during a Feb. 22 press conference in Laredo, Texas. Were only two Border Patrol agents hired under a $14.8 million initial payment of a $297 million contract? Cuellars broad claim of a troubled hiring process is accurate. But his statement overlooks some details, and the dollar figure he cited is slightly higher than the initial payment. The federal government has had problems finding and keeping people to work as Border Patrol agents, so it decided to turn to the private sector for help. U.S. Customs and Border Protection in November 2017 awarded a $297 million contract to Accenture Federal Services, so it could help the government recruit and hire 7,500 qualified candidates over five years. The jobs to fill are for Border Patrol agents, Customs and Border Protection officers, and Air and Marine Interdiction agents. The Office of Inspector General within the Department of Homeland Security audited the contract in response to hotline complaints about the contract. The inspector generals office in a December 2018 report said that Accenture had not delivered the promised hiring process or results and relied on government resources to fulfill its obligations. It detailed several other concerns. CBP risks wasting millions of taxpayer dollars on a hastily approved contract that is not meeting its proposed performance expectations, the report said. CBP must hold the contractor accountable, mitigate risk, and devise a strategy to ensure results without additional costs to the government. As of Oct. 1, 2018 — 10 months into the contract — Customs and Border Protection had paid Accenture about $13.6 million for startup costs, security requirements, recruiting, and applicant support. In return, Accenture has processed two accepted job offers, the report said. Cuellars office said his claim was based on this finding. The inspector generals office told PolitiFact that those two accepted job offers processed by Accenture were for a Border Patrol agent and for a Customs and Border Protection officer. (CBP officers work at ports of entry and dont necessarily go out on patrol duties.) Customs and Border Protection referred PolitiFact to a statement it issued after the reports publication. While we take some exception to the OIGs characterization of the contract, we do agree the contract has been a challenge, primarily due to the innovative efforts by both parties, and we are reviewing how best to use it moving forward, said part of the statement. The inspector generals report also included Customs and Border Protections response to the audit. The agency said it was inaccurate to say that the $13.6 million only yielded two accepted job offers, because Accenture also created a hiring structure, tailored technology solutions to support and manage the hiring process, stood up an applicant care center, marketed and recruited thousands of new applicants, and conducted many of the hiring steps for several thousand applicants. The inspector generals officer countered that response, saying, While we recognize that CBP has worked with Accenture to establish hiring activities, we stand by our statement that such activities have resulted in only two accepted job offers as of Oct. 1, 2018. One of the issues flagged by the report was a period when neither Accenture nor Customs and Border Protection could determine which applicants were recruited by Accenture, due to Office of Management and Budget restrictions and privacy concerns. Accenture also did not always provide human resource personnel and the people needed to conduct background investigations. And even though Accenture said it could provide an innovative applicant tracking system, it used the governments hiring system instead, the inspector general report said. Due to those shortcomings, the government modified the contract and gave the company a three-month interim period (March through June 2018) to fix those issues. During this period, Customs and Border Protection did a lot of the work Accenture was supposed to be doing. And because Accenture couldnt determine which applicants it recruited, the government agreed to give them credit and temporarily pay Accenture for a percentage of all applicants regardless of whether CBP or Accenture processed the applicants. As of Oct. 1, 2018, CBP had processed 14 applicants on behalf of Accenture. All 14 applicants accepted job offers, and seven of the 14 entered on duty, which translated to payment of approximately $500,000 to Accenture for work CBP had completed, the report said. So, even though there were these additional hires, its unclear if they were employed due to Accentures recruitment efforts. The inspector generals report said Accenture was nowhere near satisfying its 7,500-person hiring goal over the next 5 years. Customs and Border Protection told PolitiFact there were new hires from Accenture brought onboard and others who had accepted job offers since the Oct. 1, 2018 date referenced in the report. Its unclear how many were Border Patrol agents, how many were exclusively recruited and processed by Accenture, and whether they were covered in the initial payment to Accenture. Cuellar said, Trump put out a $297 million contract to a vendor to show him how to hire Border Patrol. So, the first payment they made was $14.8 million. You know how many Border Patrol they hired with $14.8 million? Two. The Trump administration awarded a $297 million contract to Accenture to help Customs and Border Protection hire 7,500 new employees over five years. That includes Border Patrol agents. An inspector general report said that as of Oct. 1, 2018, Customs and Border Protection paid Accenture about $13.6 million for startup costs, security requirements, recruiting, and applicant support. The company to that date had processed two accepted job offers, the report said. One of them was a Border Patrol agent, the other a Customs and Border Protection officer. The report mentioned 14 other accepted job offers processed by Customs and Border Protection on behalf of Accenture. But due to deficiencies in the contract, its unclear if those 14 were hired because of Accentures recruitment. Cuellars statement is accurate but needs clarification.",0.8,0.4,1.0,0.6,0.2,0.3,0.5,0.9,0.7,mostly-true

Final Rating: Mostly True  ",Rick Scott tried to slash school funding by $3.3 billion.,"Both Charlie Crist and Rick Scott will have gubernatorial records to fuel the campaign fire this year. The attacks have already started, with Crist firing a shot about Scotts budget actions over the years. On a page titled Top 5 reasons to make Florida Scott-free, Crist brings up education spending as No. 1. Rick Scott tried to slash school funding by $3.3 billion, the site says. To put that into perspective, $3.3 billion could pay the yearly salaries of more than 70,000 teachers in Florida. Considering Scott came into office during the Great Recession, his budget cutting is well known. We thought wed dive into the numbers to see whether he proposed that the states schools take a $3.3 billion hit. Slash and learn Scott entered office in 2011, facing a $3.6 billion shortfall in the states $70.5 billion budget. His solution in February 2011 was to propose cutting $4.6 billion in spending and $2.4 billion in state revenue by reducing taxes, regulations and fees. His budget came in at $65.9 billion. His proposal, encompassing two fiscal years, recommended cutting per-pupil spending by about $700, a 10 percent reduction from the states current $6,899 spending per student at the time. Part of the cuts included a 10 percent cut in the required local effort portion of property taxes and a loss of more than $870 million in federal stimulus money. In all, that added up to a projected $4.8 billion in cuts to education over the two years. The Scott plan attempted to offset some of those cuts with other federal aid and by requiring teachers to contribute 5 percent to their pension plans, adding back about $400 per student. Weve broken down some of those dollar figures before. In all, funding would have been cut some $3.3 billion the first year. Legislators did not respond well to such a drastic proposed budget reduction for schools. Are we looking at the cuts the governor is making? The answer is no, a resounding no, PreK-12 Education Appropriations subcommittee chairman Sen. David Simmons, R-Altamonte Springs, told the Gainesville Sun. After a contentious session, the Legislature passed and Scott signed a budget that included $1.3 billion in cuts to education, from $18.2 billion to $16.5 billion. The reduction ended up being about $540 per student, a 7.9 percent cut in funding. The following year, Scott requested a $1 billion increase in education dollars, which was included in the 2012-2013 state budget. The increase was needed to make up for more than 30,000 new students and a decline in property taxes from a 3 percent drop in property values. He then requested $1.2 billion more in 2013; the Legislature agreed to $1 billion. This year he has asked Tallahassee for $542 million more for next year, bringing the totals to $10.6 billion in state cash and $18.8 billion overall. This would be a record amount of spending in terms of dollars, but still less than the amount being spent per student when he took office. The ruling Crist said Rick Scott tried to slash school funding by $3.3 billion, pointing to a budget proposal from 2011, Scotts first year in office. Scott did propose cutting $3.3 billion from the education budget, alienating members of his own party in the Legislature in the process. He even had suggested cutting $4.8 billion over two years. Part of the cuts were from the loss of federal stimulus dollars, but the state had the power to restore them had it chosen to. In the end, Tallahassee approved $1.3 billion in cuts. Scott has asked for increases in the three years since. Crists statement was specifically phrased, saying Scott tried to reduce school funding. That is accurate, but its important to note that Scott's initial proposal died in the Legislature, and funding has increased since that attempt.",1.0,0.2,1.0,0.8,0.0,0.3,0.5,1.0,0.7,mostly-true

Final Rating: Mostly True  ","The most recent Associated Press poll has Nader-Gonzalez at 6 percent, without any national coverage, against McCain and Obama.","Perennial presidential candidate Ralph Nader is in an uphill battle for both media coverage and significant poll numbers. But somehow he's managing to get the latter without getting any of the former, he said in a recent radio interview. The most recent Associated Press poll has Nader-Gonzalez at 6 percent, without any national coverage, against McCain and Obama, Nader said during a June 18interviewonDemocracy Now!,an independent, left-leaning radio program. Nader garnered less than half that in the 2000 election and, by many accounts, damaged Al Gore enough to hand George W. Bush the White House. We checkedthe Associated Press pollsand found none that gave Nader 6 percent. The most recent AP poll prior to the interview was an AP-Yahoo poll from April 17 that had Nader at 3 percent. Nader spokesman Chris Driscoll acknowledged the candidate had erred, and said he meant to cite a June 6CNN/Opinion Research Corp. poll, which did indeed have Nader and his running mate Matt Gonzalez at 6 percent against Democratic Sen. Barack Obama, Republican Sen. John McCain and former GOP Rep. Bob Barr, the Libertarian candidate. The finding needs context, though. Was it just an outlier? And what does it say about how Nader will do in November? Other recent polls show Nader with less support.A Rasmussen Reports pollreleased May 18 showed Nader pulling in 4 percent against Obama, McCain and Barr.A Reuters/Zogby pollreleased June 18 showed Nader with 3 percent.A Fox News/Opinion Dynamics pollreleased June 19, the day after Nader's interview, gave him 4 percent. History suggests, however, that even these polls overstate Nader's prospects. At this time in 2000, he was showing around 4 or 5 percent in most national polls, and he ended up with 2.7 percent of the vote. Around this time in 2004, polls had Nader at anywhere from 3 to 7 percent. He got just .38 percent in the end. Now, onto Nader's assertion that his support has come without any national coverage. Clearly he was speaking rhetorically — we found his name mentioned 166 times on the major broadcast and cable news programs between the first of the year and the June 18 interview. But that's six months. Obama and McCain had been mentioned on television about that much in just the previous three days. Nader's coverage had been so slight compared to that of the major-party candidates that we have a hard time holding his hyperbole against him. We are also reluctant to pick on Nader too much for getting the name of a poll wrong. So with the caveat that his claim says little about how he'll do in November, we find it Mostly True.

Final Rating: Mostly True  ",The University of Wisconsin System budget is the biggest it has ever been.,"The 2015-16 academic year ended with pomp, circumstance -- and skirmishes between Gov. Scott Walker and professors in the University of Wisconsin System. Several days later, on May 16, 2016, Walker kept up the offensive in an interview on WTMJ-AM in Milwaukee. We have some of the best schools in the country, no doubt about it, Walker told conservative talk show host Charlie Sykes. But weve got to stop feeding into this national perception that how much you pay in tuition suddenly is a correlation to what the value is. Yeah, you want to have a reasonable level of support for the system; and we do. In fact, by the way, Walker continued, the University of Wisconsin System budget is the biggest it has ever been. The amount of money they get from state government is only a fraction of what they have overall. So, for all this hysteria out there, they have never had more money to spend in the UW System. With the 2015-17 state budget, Walker and his fellow Republicans in the Legislature cut $250 million over the two years from the UW System. That was an 11 percent reduction in state support and a big reason for the no-confidence votes. So, we wondered about Walkers claim that UW Systems budget is the biggest its ever been. Hes essentially correct, but with some caveats. Walker was referring to the systems all-funds budget -- which, as the name suggests, is comprehensive. It includes state tax dollars, but also an array of other funds, such as tuition, revenue from enterprises such as dormitories and athletics, federal research dollars and gifts.  We asked for budget figures from the nonpartisan Legislative Fiscal Bureau for the entire history of the UW System, which began in 1973-'74. Heres a look at the last six years, when the figures were highest. Year All-funds budget -- actual All-funds budget -- adjusted for inflation 2010-11 $5.591 billion $6.077 billion 2011-12 $5.589 billion $5.889 billion 2012-13 $5.901 billion $6.092 billion 2013-14 $5.997 billion $6.101 billion 2014-15 $6.098 billion $6.105 billion 2015-16 $6.194 billion* $6.059 billion As you might expect, the current all-funds budget (2015-16) is the largest on record. But with an asterisk. Thats because in 2015-16, for the first time, the UW System included unspent tuition money carried over from the previous year in its all-funds budget. If that money wasnt included, the 2015-16 all-funds budget would have been $6.059 billion -- the second-highest ever, behind 2014-15, rather than $6.194 billion. Adjusted for inflation -- a better measure for comparing figures over time -- the 2015-16 all funds budget is slightly smaller than in four of the five previous years, but still near the top. State support Walker made it clear his claim was about total funding for the UW System, and that state money covers only a portion of the systems budget. But its worth noting that, adjusted for inflation, state support of the system -- known as general purpose revenue -- is in a historic decline, according to figures from the fiscal bureau. The highest state support, adjusted for inflation, was in the first year of the system, 1973-74 -- at just under $1.52 billion. That figure hit an all-time low of $1.03 billion in 2015-16. UW System officials often cite the reduction in state support because they have generally have more flexibility in spending state tax dollars than with revenues that are designated for certain purposes. Our rating Walker said: The University of Wisconsin System budget is the biggest it has ever been. The systems 2015-16 all-funds budget -- which includes not only state tax dollars but federal funds, tuition and other income -- is $6.194 billion, the biggest since the system was created in 1973-74. But adjusted for inflation, the 2015-16 all-funds budget is among the biggest, though not the biggest. And the 2015-16 figure includes unspent tuition revenue that hadnt been counted in the all-funds budget in previous years. For a statement that is accurate but needs clarification, our rating is Mostly True.",0.8,0.5,1.0,0.7,0.0,0.5,0.4,1.0,0.6,mostly-true

Final Rating: Mostly True","Right now in Ohio 200,000 people are getting opioid treatment because they have insurance under the Affordable Care Act.","The Affordable Care Act is helping people in Ohio get the treatment they need for opioid addiction, said U.S. Sen. Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio. Right now in Ohio 200,000 people are getting opioid treatment because they have insurance under the Affordable Care Act, he said in an April 9 speech to the City Club of Cleveland. This is a common talking point by Brown, who will face the winner of the May 8 Republican primary that features U.S. Rep. Jim Renacci and businessman Mike Gibbons, among other candidates. Ohio is one of the states that expanded Medicaid as part of the 2010 federal health care law, and isone of the hardest hit states in the nation by the opioid epidemic.Experts have said that the program for the poor has helped treat those with opioid addiction. Brown was citing a valid study about the Affordable Care Act, but he didnt precisely explain what the researchers found. We learned itis difficult to pinpoint how many have gotten this type of treatment as a result of the law. Brown cited research by Harvard Medical School. The research, conducted by health economics professor Richard Frank and New York University Dean Sherry Glied, was released in January 2017 when Republicans were vowing to repeal the Affordable Care Act, though that didnt happen. Repealing the ACA — and its behavioral health provisions — would have stark effects on those with behavioral health illnesses, the researchers concluded. Nationwide, the researchers estimated that approximately 1.25 million people with serious mental disorders and about 2.8 million Americans with a substance use disorder, of whom about 222,000 have an opioid disorder, would lose some or all of their insurance coverage if the federal health care law was repealed. In Ohio, the researchers found that 220,512 people with addiction or mental health disorders had coverage under the Affordable Care Act in 2016. (Brown said right now, but this data is two years old.) About151,200 obtained coveragethrough the Medicaid expansion and 69,225 obtained plansthrough the marketplace. While Brown specifically said that 200,000 were getting opioid treatment, the research was more broad, because it addresses addiction and mental health disorders in general. Sometimes Brown has more precisely explained that 200,000 figure, including in a press statement when the study was released. But at other times, he has said that 200,000 Ohioans were getting opioid treatment through the Affordable Care Act. One of the researchers confirmed for PolitiFact that the 220,000 figure referred to significant behavioral health or substance use disorder needs.  The data we had analyzed do not indicate how many in this group used substance use treatment services, said Glied of NYU. Its clear that more broadly, Medicaid expansion has helped Ohioans seek drug treatment. Glied said that about half of all medication-assisted treatment for substance abuse treatment in Ohio is paid by Medicaid. Browns office spokeswoman, Jennifer Donahue, pointed to news reports showing that 500,000 low-income Ohio adults received mental health and addiction services under the states Medicaid expansion, including many for drug addiction. Donahue also cited news reports showing Republican Gov. John Kasich credited the Medicaid expansion for helping treat opioid addicts. Other health care experts, including the Kaiser Family Foundation, have expressed similar views that the Affordable Care Actwill play a key role in tackling the opioid epidemic. Spokespersons for state departments of health, addiction services and Medicaid told us they didnt have any data showing how many Ohioans had received opioid treatment as a result of the Affordable Care Act. However, between the time Ohio expanded Medicaid in 2014 through August 2017, more than 633,000 Ohioans with behavioral health needs had accessed services, including addiction treatment and mental health, throughexpanded Medicaid coverage. But we dont know how many in this group received opioid treatment. The state data suggests that those receiving services may be even higher than the Harvard study, which was based on 2016 data, if we include additional years. Brown said, Right now in Ohio 200,000 people are getting opioid treatment because they have insurance under the Affordable Care Act. Harvard and New York Universityresearchers concluded that about 220,000 people with addiction or mental health disorders had coverage through the Affordable Care Act, either through Medicaid expansion or purchasing insurance on the exchange, in 2016. But Brown oversimplified the study.The statistic is more broad than those who have received treatment for opioid addiction. Other state data suggest the number could be higher than 220,000, if we include multiple years. Browns general point that the Affordable Care Act has benefited people who need opioid treatment is supported by experts.",0.7,0.5,1.0,0.6,0.0,0.3,0.5,0.4,0.5,mostly-true

Final Rating: Mostly True  ","Says for the equivalent cost of a single mile of freeway, we have a bike infrastructure.","Portlands biking infrastructure is the stuff of legends. For the people who support it, were Biketown U.S.A. -- the city that boasts (at least among medium and large cities) the highest bike commuter rate. For those who are less into that title, our investments in cycling paths and signs are monetary drains on the city budget.Youd think, then, given the strong feelings, that Portland has made significant investments to get a significant infrastructure.But something Mayor Sam Adams said recently caught our attention. In a video on Streetfilms.org, Adams touts our biking culture while adding that we built our bike network for about the same amount of cash that a mile of highway would set us back.You know in 1993 we weren't the bicycling capital of America, he says. Seventeen years later, for the equivalent cost of a single mile of freeway, we have a bike infrastructure.Could that be true? We checked it out.Our first stop was the mayors office, which forwarded us an e-mail from Roger Geller, the citys bike coordinator. Geller said that in 2009, the staff set out to put together an estimated total cost for the citys bike infrastructure in 2008 dollars.When all was said and done, they came up with an estimated value of $52 million and adjusted it up to $60 million to be safe. Heres how they arrived at that figure:We assumed that all elements that contributed to the city's bikeway system were reasonable costs to include, even if they were not built for the express purpose of creating a bikeway. For example, we included the cost of pedestrian half-signals and bicycle-pedestrian bridges across I-5, among others. These signals and bridges facilitate crossings for existing bicycle boulevards, even though they were in place before the bicycle boulevards were constructed.For multi-use trails we split the construction cost of the trail in half and assigned half the cost to pedestrians. For the Eastbank Esplanade I believe we divided the cost into thirds and assigned one-third of the cost to park development, as much of the construction of that pathway was not about transportation but was also about creating a parklike environment.To be clear, he added, the network did not actually cost $60 million. It was probably less than that: The $60 million figure is essentially the replacement value of our network as it existed in 2008 in 2008 dollars. In other words, if the bikeway network disappeared overnight -- and all the elements that contribute to its functionality, whether built by the city's bikeway program or not -- $60 million is approximately what it would cost to replace it all.We called Geller directly to go over the specifics with him, just to make sure we were on the same page. We wanted to be sure that this official estimate included bike-only corridors and other such construction projects.He confirmed it did, adding: I'm very confident in the quality of our estimates.The one thing Geller said it didnt include was city programs that deal with bicycles -- Oregon Safe Routes to School, for example. Even so, the cost of those activities, stretching back to 2004, could be absorbed in the rounding up from $52 million to $60 million, Geller said.Next up, we needed an estimated cost for a mile of freeway. This is where things get a bit tricky.The cost of a mile of freeway isnt easy to pin down. The mayors office said Adams was referring to a mile of a typical 4-lane urban freeway. That cost, according to the citys data, ranges between $20 to $80 million depending on various environmental factors.They chose $60 million -- the middle road -- to indicate the average cost. Of course, Geller wrote in the original e-mail, it is possible to find examples right here in our region of a single interchange that cost much more than $60 million.Their source for that figure was the Rails to Trails Conservancy. That group published the figure in a 2008 report on transportation. We asked the Conservancy for their original source and they sent us a document that offers a considerably wider price range.According to that document the cost of freeways (in 2006 dollars) breaks down as such:-Rural areas: $3.1 million to $9.1 million per lane mile; $12.4 million to $36.4 million for a four-lane mile.-Urban areas: $4.9 miilion to $19.5 million per lane mile; $19.6 million to $78 million for a four lane mile.-Areas with severe restrictions: $16.8 million to $74.7 million per lane mile; $67.2 million to nearly $300 million for a four-lane mile.We tried to get some official estimates from the U.S. Department of Transportation, but they did not respond to our inquiry. Still, the numbers that the Conservancy reported seem to match other estimates, such as this one from the Michigan Department of Transportation.So, where does that put us with our ruling?It seems to us that Gellers estimate of the total value of the bike infrastructure is somewhat inflated. When Adams used this statistic he didnt make clear that he was talking about an urban four-lane freeway. But, certainly, $60 million in bike infrastructure is well above the $12.4 million it would take to make a mile of four-lane rural freeway.That said, Adams is the mayor of an urban area and it makes sense that he would be thinking in terms of the cost of urban freeway construction. When youre talking about that sort of freeway construction, $60 million falls pretty near the middle of the $20 million to $80 million estimated average cost.The mayor could have been a little more exact, but his statistic -- that Portland has spent on its bikeway infrastructure what it would spend on a mile of freeway -- seems to stand up to scrutiny.

Final Rating: Mostly True  ",I have had the challenge during this administration to suspend no less than 37 public officials in about 36 months.,"Some of Florida's public officials have been bad boys and girls, Gov. Charlie Crist says. You know, I have had the challenge during this administration to suspend no less than 37 public officials in about 36 months, Crist told reporters gathered in Tallahassee on Jan. 27, 2010. It's pretty stunning, and it's pretty disappointing. The Florida Constitution enables Crist, as governor, to suspend any elected public official indicted for a crime and remove public officials from office who are convicted. The governor also can suspend state or county officials -- anyone from people appointed to state or local boards or even public notaries -- for misconduct. Is Crist really on a suspension-a-month pace? We asked the governor's office for a list of people suspended by the governor since he took office in January 2007. Officials provided a seven-page document listing 38 names and titles of people they say the governor has suspended or removed from public office. Each entry includes a corresponding charge and points to an executive order codifying the action. (You can read the governor's document for yourself.) The list includes some familiar names: *No. 28 -- James Bob Richburg, the former Northwest Florida State College president. Richburg was suspended from the board of directors of Workforce Florida in April 2009 after being indicted in the case involving former House Speaker Ray Sansom. Sansom has been accused of falsely securing $6 million in taxpayer money to construct a college building that would double as an aircraft hangar for a friend and major Republican donor. * No. 35 -- Scott Rothstein. Rothstein was suspended from a judicial nominating committee after agreeing to be permanently disbarred. A major political fundraiser, Rothsteinpleaded guilty on Jan. 27, 2010, to five counts of racketeering, fraud and money laundering as part of a $1.2 billion Ponzi scheme. * No. 34 and No. 38 -- Miami City Commissioner Michelle Spence-Jones. Spence-Jones was suspended by Crist in November 2009 after being arrested on charges that she redirected $50,000 in county funds to a now-defunct family business. She won her seat back in a special election in January 2010. She was immediately suspended again. The list also includes people probably unfamiliar to most, including eight notary publics. The notary publics, who are considered state officers under Florida law, were suspended in most cases for notarizing signatures and documents improperly. Examining the full list, we found some problems: * Beverly Gallagher,a member of the Broward County School Board, is listed wrongly both as No. 30 and 32. Her entries point to two different executive orders -- one that removes her from office, and one that removes someone else. Gallagher and Broward County Commissioner Josephus Eggelletion (No. 31 on the governor's list) were arrested in September on federal corruption charges, accused of taking bribes. * Gregory Burke is both No. 7 and No. 25. Burke, a commissioner of the South Walton County Mosquito Control District, was first suspended from office Dec. 13, 2007, then removed by Crist on Dec. 24, 2008 -- hence the two separate entries. * Two officials -- Miami City Commissioner Johnny Lee Winton and Hollywood City Commissioner Kenneth Wasserstrom -- were removed from office by Crist but actually suspended by Gov. Jeb Bush. * Another official, Miramar City Commissioner Fitzroy Salesman, appears on the list twice. The first entry was from March 2007, when he was reinstated into office by Crist (he had been suspended by Bush). Salesman was then suspended by Crist in December 2007 after being arrested. * No. 20, Johnny Green, was suspended from the Cross City water board after being charged with one count of conspiracy to commit bribery, according to the governor's office. Green's entry appears to note that the suspension was dissolved by Executive Order 08-235, but that order actually acknowledges a judicial vacancy in the 17th Judicial Circuit. The governor's list also includes one person who has returned to office and appears to overlook another person the governor suspended in 2008. John Scanlon, a commissioner with the Fort Myers Beach Fire Control District, was suspended after drug charges, but reinstated after completion of a pretrial diversion program. And James Roy Paul, superintendent of the Escambia County School District, was suspended from office by the governor in June 2008 after being charged with driving under the influence. But he was not on the governor's list. Where does all of that bring us in the accounting? First, we excluded the double reference to Gallagher and the entry reinstating Salesman. That drops us to 36. We then added Paul, who was not on the governor's list. Back to 37. We then double-checked that everyone on that list had been in fact suspended. We relied on the governor's online repository of executive orders, and when that didn't help, news accounts. When both options failed, as it did in one case, we asked the governor's office for the executive order directly. Then there was the case of three officials (Winton, Wasserstrom, Burke) whom Crist removed from office. You can make an argument that reduces the number of suspensions to 34. Crist told reporters he has had to suspend no less than 37 public officials since taking office in 2007. He's just about right on. The number actually includes people Cristremoved from office, a more severe punishment than suspension. And the final number includes the suspensions of eight public notaries -- not what most people think of when they hear public official. Crist gets points off for both, and from PolitiFact, a rating of Mostly True.",0.8,0.5,1.0,0.6,0.1,0.2,0.4,1.0,0.7,mostly-true

Final Rating: Mostly True  ","Anywhere in the world, when someone uses a mobile phone, e-mail, the Internet or GPS, they are enjoying the benefits of the American miracle.","U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio used his first speech on the Senate floor, on June 14, 2011, to evoke the American dream. The so-called maiden speech is a big deal for a senator, said fellow Florida Sen. Bill Nelson — and Rubio went for big ideas.America is not perfect, said the freshman Republican, the child of Cuban immigrants. ... But since her earliest days, America has inspired people from all over the world. Inspired them with the hope that one day their own countries would be one like this one. Many others decided they could not wait. And so they came here from everywhere, to pursue their dreams and to work to leave their children better off than themselves. And the result was the American miracle.As he held the floor for nearly 15 minutes, Rubio highlighted rags-to-riches stories that he said happen only in America, describing the founders of Nordstrom, Mattel and eBay. When he finished, Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., commended him, saying, No one expresses American exceptionalism better than Sen. Rubio.Rubio traced Americas role in the 20th century, from two world wars to the Cold War and the defeat of communism. Then he turned to other contributions:While our military and foreign policy contributions helped save the world, it was our economic and cultural innovations that helped transform it. The fruits of the American miracle can be found in the daily lives of people everywhere. Anywhere in the world, when someone uses a mobile phone, e-mail, the Internet or GPS, they are enjoying the benefits of the American miracle. Anywhere in the world, when a bone marrow, lung or heart transplant saves a life, they are touched by the value of the American miracle. And on one night in July of 1969, the whole world witnessed the American miracle firsthand. For on that night an American walked on the surface of the moon, and it was clear to the whole world that these Americans could do anything.We briefly considered wading into fringe conspiracy theories about whether astronauts actually walked on the moon, but got control of ourselves. We were more curious about his other technology claims. Were Americans truly the ones responsible for innovation of the mobile phone, e-mail, the Internet and the global positioning system?We dropped a line to Rubio spokesman Alex Burgos, who provided us with links about inventors of the mobile phone, e-mail, the Internet and GPS. Indeed, stories from The Telegraph (via Huffington Post), NPR, the Internet Society, PBS and MITnews identify American origins for all four technologies. But these are complex systems that have developed over time. We wondered: Was there more to the story?Mobile phoneA lot fits under the umbrella mobile phone -- including, say, early radio technology that led to car phones by the 1940s. But Rubios spokesman pointed to the inventor of the first portable cellular phone, which is fine by us. (Did you think of dawn-of-the-1900s ship-to-shore communication when Rubio said mobile phone? We didnt think so.)Martin Cooper worked for Illinois company Motorola as it developed the DynaTAC phone and the cellular network behind it in the early 1970s. The lead engineer for the team that developed the phone, Martin made the first wireless call from Manhattan in 1973. The FCC approved the phone -- the worlds first commercial portable cell phone -- for regular folks in 1983.Now, Japan and some European countries were quicker to deploy cellular networks, in the late 70s and very early 80s. But Paul Levinson, a Fordham University professor who wrote the 2004 book Cellphone: The Story of the World's Most Mobile Medium and How It Has Transformed Everything! says its the phone that matters.That was the breakthrough, he said There were several different companies and scientists working on it.  But no one believed that it could be done.  So everything that came afterwards was based on that first breakthrough.An American breakthrough. Score one for Rubio.Internet & E-mailWe read the work from the Internet Society and PBS that Burgos sent our way, then exchanged messages with Stephen Stein, who teaches the history of technology at the University of Memphis.Computer networks that led to the Internet we know today include Arpanet , a 1970s project of the U.S. Department of Defense, and NSFnet, created by the National Science Foundation in the 1980s. These projects, with their indisputably American roots, provided two cornerstones of the modern-day Web: the TCP/IP protocol and a major communications backbone.But Stein pointed out that the way we interact with the Internet owes much to the work of Tim Berners-Lee, a British scientist who worked for CERN, the European Particle Physics Laboratory in Switzerland. It was there -- in the late 80s as NSFnet was being developed in the United States -- that Berners-Lee developed the whole concept of the World Wide Web, Stein said. (Theres more on this in a PBS article related to the one Burgos sent.)HTTP? HTML? Both Berners-Lee.So, yes, Americans developed the Internet, but Berners-Lee made it user-friendly, Stein said.Meanwhile, Virginia Tech scholar Janet Abbate says in her 1999 book Inventing the Internet, published by MIT Press, that even in the expansion of Arpanet , Americans enlisted the help of computer experts from England and France. She also points to Berners-Lees contributions, saying, The history of the Internet is not  a story of a few heroic inventors; it is a tale of collaboration and conflict among a remarkable variety of players.The origins of e-mail, as you might expect, are entwined with the Internet. Electronic mail was part of the development of Arpanet in the early 70s, according to Stein, Abbate and others. American programmer Ray Tomlinson gets credit (and tongue-in-cheek blame) for the first working network mail program, picked up by users of Arpanet sites. Here's what Abbate told us when we asked her about Rubio's claim. I think it's an overstatement to call the Internet a purely American product. Certainly other countries were building their own computer networks (and inter-networks) in parallel with the U.S.; these other networks eventually became part of the Internet, Abbate said. Also, the Internet itself (as opposed to the earlier Apranet) was a collaborative effort with input from computer scientists in France and elsewhere, and I argue in my book that the diversity of input made the resulting system stronger. I do think the U.S. did a remarkably good job with the Internet design and expansion, maybe better than anyone else would or could have done. But if the resulting Internet hadn't suited other countries' needs, they were perfectly capable of creating their own networks (indeed, for a while there were a number of different competing network systems before TCP/IP eventually became the standard). And of course, the World Wide Web was invented at CERN, not in the US or by an American. So does that mean we in the U.S. are enjoying the benefits of the Swiss miracle every time we use the Web? GPSThe satellite technology that puts some of the smart in your smart phone and informs your cars navigation system is a system of satellites funded by taxpayers and operated by the U.S. government. So calling the global positioning system an American miracle is no stretch. The technology was born at Aerospace Corp., a military research contractor in El Segundo, Calif. Its founding president was New York native Ivan Getting. That isnt to say there arent foreign navigation satellites. The United States cooperates with Australia, China, the European Union, India, Japan and Russia on global navigation satellite systems, sometimes referred to as GNSS. But Rubio said GPS, and the history there is fairly clear -cut.The rulingWhat to make of all of this?Rubio's basic point, that the technology behind mobile phones, e-mail, the Internet and GPS all have American roots, holds up. Its true in a general sense, said Sherry Turkle, a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who writes on our relationship with technology. Or, as the University of Memphis professor, Stein, put it: The statement is superficially correct, but there is (as usual) more to the story. Stein was most concerned about the non-American role in the development of the Internet, especially the substantial contribution of England's Berners-Lee.Its also important to note in the context of Rubios only in America rhetoric that while the United States led, it wasnt alone in its innovation. Other nations researchers contributed to the early Internet; commercial mobile phone networks were available overseas before they were in America; other nations operate satellite navigation systems. But in these areas and many others, Americans can claim primacy.",0.7,0.5,1.0,0.6,0.4,0.6,0.8,1.0,0.5,mostly-true

Final Rating: Mostly True",The school voucher bill the Iowa Legislature is considering would give your education tax dollars to corporations.,"Iowa Republicans have forged ahead with efforts to dramatically change education policy in the state, while Democrats and some education leaders and teachers argue a school choice proposal from Gov. Kim Reynolds would divert money from public school systems that need it now more than ever. The push comes after Reynolds highlighted school choice in January during herCondition of the State Address. She argued that parents need flexibility when deciding where their children go to school, especially during a pandemic, but also because available services might vary dramatically from one public school district to another. School choice shouldnt be limited to those who have the financial means or are lucky to live in a district thats confident enough to allow open enrollment, Reynolds said during her Jan. 12 address. Republicans quickly announced their support and theIowa SenatepassedSF 159on Thursday, Jan. 28. The Iowa State Education Association, a prominent Iowa teachers union, launched acampaignagainst the bill and theIowa-Nebraska NAACPargued that it disproportionately would disadvantage low-income families of color while hampering desegregation efforts. Another opponent wasChristina Blackcloud, a Democratic activist from Tama, Iowa, who lost a bid last fall to unseat state Rep. Dean Fisher (R-Montour). Blackcloudtweetedon Jan. 23: Can I be blunt? The school voucher bill that Republicans are trying to ram through the Iowa Legislature would give your education tax dollars to corporations in the hopes they will magically fix education The tweet had been retweeted 190 times and liked by more than 700 people as February started, but would tax dollars usually sent to public schools be sent to corporations? To answer that, we followed the money. The Iowa bill would give financial aid for private school tuition and other education costs to a student who otherwise would attend a public school determined by the federalEvery Student Succeeds Actas needing comprehensive support and improvement. The private school also would have to accept the student for enrollment. The financial aid would come from a Student First Scholarship Program that the bill would establish. That program would be funded by depositing into an account created for a student opting to attend a private school a portion of the per-pupil state funding that youths school district would have received to educate the student. Areportfrom the states Legislative Services Agency estimates that Iowas public school districts would lose $2.1 million that is diverted to private schools in 2023 if the governors plan passes. The state money is raised through a combination of sources, including property taxes. The bill limits spending that money to qualified educational expenses, which include tuition but also fees for tests such as advanced placement exams. Students opting out of their local public school could use state money to attend either private schools or charter schools. But those schools may or may not be considered corporations. Technically,corporationsare a group of individuals legally allowed to act as a single entity, and both public school districts and public charter schools are referred to as corporations inIowa law. But thats not the common understanding of what a corporation represents. In an email exchange with PolitiFact, Blackcloud expressed concern that for-profit education service providers would be allowed to manage charter schools under Reynolds plan. She declined to clarify what she meant when describing private and charter schools as corporations. Charter schoolsare privately run, publicly funded schools. Many are managed by outside organizations, which the Iowa bill calls education service providers, that can be both for-profit and not-for-profit. SF 159 mandates that charter schools form as not-for-profit education organizations but says nothing about whether the education service providers the schools contract with must be for-profit or not-for-profit. TheNational Alliance for Public Charter Schoolsreported in 2019 that 12 percent of U.S. charter schools are managed by for-profit companies and 23 percent are managed by not-for-profit companies. The other 65 percent are independently managed. In general, though, theres no indication of how many charter schools in Iowa would be run by for-profit companies if Reynolds plan passes, especially as the plan would make forming charter schools much easier. That holds true for private schools as well. Blackcloud said, The school voucher bill that Republicans are trying to ram through the Iowa Legislature would give your education tax dollars to corporations in the hopes they will magically fix education. In its current form, SF 159 reallocates money that normally would be spent in public school systems, instead supporting students attending nonpublic schools. That money would be handed over to schools that, under Iowa law, are considered corporations. But, other not-for-profit options will exist, too, for nonpublic schooling.",0.7,0.6,0.9,0.6,0.4,0.5,0.4,0.9,0.5,mostly-true

Final Rating: Mostly True  ",I cut spending while serving in the state Legislature,"The cornerstone for any Republican seeking to be the next U.S. Representative for New Hampshires Second Congressional District is to come across as an authentic, fiscal conservative. And soon after Salem Republican state Rep. Marilinda Garcia announced that she would enter the Second District race, she touted her cost-cutting chops. I cut spending while serving in the state Legislature and will take that much-needed experience to Washington, Garcia, 30, declared in one of her first post-announcement statements on her Twitter account. The Telegraph and PolitiFact New Hampshire sought to determine the accuracy of that statement. State budget votes Garcia was first elected to the New Hampshire House in 2006 and was a backbencher when Democrats took control of the 400-member body for the first time in nearly a century. Garcia lost her reelection bid in 2008, but quickly won her seat back in a 2009 special election. Initially, Garcia served on the House Children and Family Law Committee, the panel that oversees divorce, adoption and custody but has essentially no direct impact on state spending matters. Claiming to cut spending is a pretty broad statement, but well start with the major vote New Hampshire legislators take to increase or cut spending -- consideration of the states biennial budget. When Garcia was sworn in on Jan. 3, 2007, the state budget set by her fellow Republicans was $9.3 billion. The subsequent $9.7 billion budget, called for a 4 percent increase for fiscal years 2008 and 2009 was written primarily by Democrats. Garcia voted against it. The next $11.5 billion budget, also written by Democrats, called for a hefty 19 percent increase in spending for fiscal years 2010 and 2011. Garcia also voted against that. And the next state budget, crafted by conservative Republicans, including Garcia,after the GOP took over the chamber, cut back spending by more than a billion dollars to $10.3 billion. That budget plan was the first reduction in absolute dollars since World War II. Garcia voted in favor of that budget. Finally, the most recent $11 billion budget, covering fiscal years 2013 and 2014 and written by a Democratic majority, restored some of the cuts made in the previous budget. Garcia again voted no, though she said he didnt mind restoringcuts to higher education, public safety and programs for troubled children. I thought with existing recovery of revenues we could add back some of those items, Garcia said in response to our inquiry about her record of cutting spending. Instead, she said she voted against it because of the removal of the Certificate of Need program that approves all construction projects for hospitals. I wanted to see those health care reforms in place, but they got taken out, so that's why I voted against it, Garcia said. Still, her budget votes while in the House are fairly consistent: Shes voted against every budget that called for an increase in spending and supported the one that cut spending. Other spending Reviewing Garcias entire, seven-year voting record and the bills she sponsored, Garcia consistently supportedpolicies that would cut spending and taxes. In 2011, she voted to cut the taxes on hotel room rentals and meals and tobacco. She endorsed making it easier for local governments to adopt spending caps and supported banning higher-education spending on New Hampshire Public Television. Last year she opposed raising state taxes on gasoline and tobacco. In addition, in 2011, Garcia voted for a bill to require agencies propose every two years how they would live with 10 percent cut in state spending. And in 2012, Garcia voted in favor of business tax breaks totaling more than $10 million a year. She did vote in favor of one bill that could have increased spending at the local level. She voted for House Bill 1305 in 2012 that would have reinstated an exemption from property taxes for telephone and communication company poles and conduits. Critics said this could have led to raising local property taxes $5 million to $6 million statewide to make up the difference. The GOP-led House killed the bill 166-133, with Garcia on the losing end. Does she deserve credit for cutting spending? When politicians claim credit for something that happens on their watch, we consider whether that credit is justified before we give the statement a Truth-O-Meter rating. In Garcias case, she is a legislator, not an executive, so she cant unilaterally cut spending. And much of the time, she has been in the minority. However, during the one session in which she served in the majority, she can make a plausible claim for deserving credit for lower spending. In April 2011, then-House Speaker William O'Brien, a Republican, appointed Garcia to the House Finance Committee. She served on the committee when the state faced an $800 million budgetary hole caused by overly optimistic revenue projections. We solved it not by raising taxes but by cutting in a responsible way, Garcia said. At least one fellow Republican agrees. Former House Chief of Staff Gregory Moore said that when it comes to budgets, there are three kinds of legislators: Those who believe in smaller government, those who believe in more government and those who are pragmatic on the question from issue to issue. From the outset, Marilinda Garcia came from the first camp. Our ruling Garcia said, I cut spending while serving in the state Legislature. Her voting record on the state budget -- which comprises any legislators biggest impact on state spending -- show that Garcia voted against every budget that increased spending and voted in favor of the OBrien budget that cut state spending for the first time since World War II. We found two minor asterisks. Even though she voted against the most recent state budget, she didnt oppose it because it increased spending -- she opposed it because of how it treated a program that governs hospital construction and expansion. And she supported a bill on telephone and communication company poles and conduits that would have had the effect of raising taxes.Still, there are few, if any, votes shes taken that would have increased spending or increased the size of government.",0.8,0.3,0.9,0.5,0.2,0.4,0.3,0.9,0.6,mostly-true

Final Rating: Mostly True",A gay man who survived #orlando hate crime can STILL show up to work in FL tomorrow and have his boss fire him simply because he is gay.,"As the motive behind the deadly June 12 shooting at a gay nightclub in Orlando was still being debated, singer Clay Aiken took to Twitter to characterize it as a hate crime and report that gays can be summarily fired in Florida simply because of their sexual orientation. A gay man who survived #orlando hate crime can STILL show up to work in FL tomorrow and have his boss fire him simply because he is gay, Aiken tweeted. For this fact check, we will look at whether Florida really offers no job protection to gays and lesbians. The short answer: Aiken is mostly correct when it comes to Florida as a whole, but he's wrong to suggest that there is no protection anywhere in the state. Federal law does not protect the employment rights of the LGBT community, nor does the state of Florida. However, thanks to city and county law, members of the LGBT community do have employment protection in some areas of Florida. Currently, 10 counties and 19 cities, including Tampa, St. Petersburg, Miami, Miami Beach, St. Augustine, Sarasota and Orlando, have passed protections for gay workers, according to Frank Penela, communications director for the Florida Commission on Human Relations. Penela also reported that although state law doesn't specifically reference LGBT status in employment, the Commission will accept some cases under sex-based discrimination. Allegations of gender identity/transgender discrimination, for example, can be viewed as sex discrimination. Aiken spokesman Josh Pultz noted that bills designed to add protection for gender identity and sexual orientation died in Florida's House and Senate in 2016. Regardless of existing employment anti discrimination ordinances protecting LGBT in at least 31 municipalities, covering as many as 15 counties in the state, the state does not provide such protections — leaving LGBT workers in as many as 52 of the 67 counties without any protection from being terminated because of their orientation, Pultz said in an email. Clay's comment stated nothing more than that a gay man in Florida can still be fired for being gay. It did not specify any certain municipality and therefore is factually accurate, he wrote. According to the American Civil Liberties Union's website, 22 states and the District of Columbia prohibit employment discrimination based on sexual orientation. The District and 19 states also ban discrimination based on gender identity. That makes Floridaone of 28 states with no statewide protection against discrimination. Our ruling Aiken tweeted, A gay man who survived #orlando hate crime can STILL show up to work in FL tomorrow and have his boss fire him simply because he is gay. That is generally true across the state, because gays and lesbians lack protection from employment discrimination under state law and under federal law.However, 19 Floridacities often offer protection to gay workers, including the city of Orlando. Another 10 counties also offer protections. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/7e41f675-9288-4071-bbb7-5510906aa369",0.8,0.4,1.0,0.6,0.3,0.1,0.5,1.0,0.7,mostly-true

Final Rating: Mostly True  ","Since the Sandy Hook tragedy, more than seven children PER DAY have died from gun violence.","U.S. Rep. Jackie Speier, D-San Mateo, is one of Californias most prominent advocates for gun control -- and one of the few members of Congress to personally experience and survive gun violence. Speierwas shot five times at point blank range in 1978 on a trip accompanying Rep. Leo Ryan to Jonestown, the remote commune in Guyana where 909 people died from cyanide poisoning and other means. Speier was a legal adviser to Ryan, who along with four others were shot and killed in an ambush near the compound. Speier was rescued a day later. Since then, shes spent much of her career in politics leading the call for gun safety. It was no surprise Speierspoke out against gun violence on Dec. 14, 2016, the fourth anniversary of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting. The shooter killed 20 students, ages six and seven, along with six adult staff members in whats considered the deadliest mass shooting at a school in U.S. history. On the anniversary, Speierposted an image on Twitter of herself holding a card reading #EndGunViolence. Above the image she claimed: Since the Sandy Hook tragedy, more than seven children PER DAY have died from gun violence. We wanted to know whether the startling and somber statistic was true. We set out on a fact check. Our research A spokeswoman for Speier cited the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence as the source of the statistic. She said the campaign used information from an online database of fatal injury reports maintained by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. We did not hear back from a spokesman for the Brady Campaign. But we found a similar statistic on the organizations website: Every day, 7 children and teens die from gun violence. The website notes that it crunched CDC data for children and young people through age 19. The federal agency is considered a leading authority on mortality and injury statistics. It includes data through 2015. To examine Speiers claim, we searched the database for the number of young people who died in connection with guns from the start of 2013 through 2015. Those are the most recent available years following the Sandy Hook shooting. We found 7,838 deaths in connection with firearms for people ages 0 through 19. That works out to 7.15 deaths a day during this three-year period -- which matches Speiers claim of more than seven per day. These include all types of gun deaths from accidents to homicides to suicides. About 36 percent resulted from suicides. Some might take issue with Speier lumping in 18 year-olds and 19 year-olds as children. Gun deaths for these two ages accounted for nearly half of the 7,838 young people killed in the two-year period. Heres a look at the breakdown of deaths by age group: 0-4 years: 247 5-9 years: 218 10-14 years: 847 15-19 years: 6,526 The National Institute of Justice, a research arm of the U.S. Department of Justice, has stated that young people aged 15 to 24 are the group most at risk for gun violence. If considering only elementary school aged children, the total who die in connection with guns would be roughly one every four days -- still a tragic number, but not close to seven per day. We interpreted Speiers use of the word children, however, to include a broader group of young people, including teenagers. Our ruling California Congresswoman Jackie Speier recently claimed: Since the Sandy Hook tragedy, more than seven children PER DAY have died from gun violence. Speiers claim is backed up by the CDCs fatal injury report data, which shows an average of 7.15 young people per day, aged 0 to 19, died in connection with firearms between 2013 and 2015. Its important to note these include all types of gun deaths: accidents, homicides and suicides. All gun deaths are violent, but Speiers statement could be interpreted as only including homicides or accidents. Finally, Speiers claim might also lead some to think shes talking about young school aged children, given that she invokes an elementary school shooting. The data show teenagers and young adults make up the vast majority of deaths due to guns in America, while elementary aged children account for a small fraction. The Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, the source Speier relied on, offers a more complete look at this statistic on its website. It notes that children and teens are included in the seven deaths per day. Speiers statement is on the right track. But it could have used some clarifications.

Final Rating: Mostly True",Says Betsy DeVos is the most unpopular person in our government.,"A congressional hearing about the Trump administrations policy on student debt turned personal for Education Secretary Betsy DeVos. Most of the Dec. 12 hearing focused on DeVos actions related to a student debt relief rule. Democrats said DeVos made it harder for certain students to get debt relief, while Republicans defended her response to Obama-era rules. At the hearing, the main topic was how DeVos sought to make changes to the borrower defense to repayment rule. The provision was little used until the Obama administration established new rules to help students get their federal education loans cancelled if colleges misrepresented graduation rates, their ability to transfer credits or their job placement rates. The Obama administration finalized changes to the regulations in 2016 after Corinthian Colleges, a for-profit chain, closed its doors amid fraud allegations. DeVos sought to rewrite the rules, leading to extensive litigation, including a contempt of court finding against DeVos. DeVos blamed the Obama administration for the backlog of tens of thousands of cases and announced changes that include tiers of loan relief. U.S. Rep. Frederica Wilson, a former school board member and principal from South Florida, went after DeVos, saying she is trying to destroy public education. You are the most unpopular person in our government, said Wilson, a Democrat. Millions will register to vote in 2020. Many will vote to remove you more than to remove the president. The ranking Republican on the committee, Rep. Virginia Foxx of North Carolina, said Wilsons comments were over the line. DeVoss confirmation in 2017 was a contentious one for the Trump administration and required a tie-breaking vote by Vice President Mike Pence. DeVos, a longtime wealthy Republican donor from Michigan, is an advocate for vouchers and charter schools. As fact-checkers, we wanted to focus on the checkable aspect of what Wilson said: Is DeVos really the most unpopular person in the U.S. government? Wilsons statement about in our government was overly broad, but what she was referring to was what poll respondents said about DeVos compared to other Trump Cabinet officials. We found polling that supports Wilsons statement about DeVoss popularity, but the polling is more than one year old. We found that YouGov and Morning Consult have conducted separate polls that compare the favorability of Trumps Cabinet members. Wilsons spokeswoman cited a 2017 article in the Huffington Post entitled, How Betsy DeVos Became The Most Hated Cabinet Secretary. The article cited an October 2017 HuffPost/YouGov internet poll that found 35% had a strongly unfavorable view of DeVos, the highest among 13 officials. (Former Attorney General Jeff Sessions finished second.) However, the poll also showed that many respondents were not familiar enough with the Cabinet members to give a favorability opinion. DeVos was among the most familiar officials, as 30% of respondents said they were unfamiliar with her. YouGov has polled about DeVos favorability five times since she was appointed. The most recent poll, in April 2018, found DeVos had the highest very unfavorable rating (28%). Politico/Morning Consult polled about the favorability of DeVos on four occasions since 2017, with the most recent one in the spring of 2018. That poll showed DeVos with a 31% very unfavorable rating, the highest among 15 Cabinet members. Even though the polls are a little dated, Wilsons statement is consistent with the evidence, said Washington University political scientist Steven S. Smith. Education Department spokeswoman Angela Morabito told PolitiFact that DeVos isnt working to win a popularity contest. But she pointed to polling by an education research and policy journal showing growing public support for certain school choice programs. Related: By the numbers: Is college worth the cost? Wilson said DeVos is the most unpopular person in our government. Two polling organizations asking about popularity for about a dozen Trump administration officials back up her statement, though they are a little outdated. We found no polling about the popularity for DeVos in 2019.",0.7,0.3,0.9,0.5,0.2,0.4,0.6,0.5,0.4,mostly-true

Final Rating: Mostly True  ","Of 30,000 individuals arrested a year for crimes that are 16 or 17, over 95 percent of them do not result in a criminal conviction. Only 1.5 percent of them ultimately go to state prison.","New York remains one of two states that can prosecute 16- and 17-year-old defendants as adults in criminal courts. Some Albany lawmakers want all of them treated as children in Family Court instead. They're pressing to include a measure to accomplish that as part of state budget negotiations.They want separate facilities for those sentenced to serve time, saying that separating them from criminals 18 and over in prison would lower the recidivism rate for the younger offenders.Lowering the age of criminal responsibility would lead to shorter sentences for the younger offenders. Opponents of the measure, however, warn about a blanket policy that treats every 16- and 17-year-old offenderas a child. They want judges to be able to decide who to treat as adults in cases involving serious crimeslike murder or sexual assault. The two sides are still negotiating. State Sen. Pat Gallivan, a Republican from Elma, says such a broad proposal may not be necessary because New York state usually treats 16- and 17-year-old defendants differently than adults. When you have roughly 30,000 individuals arrested a year for crimes that are 16 or 17, over 95 percent of them do not result in a criminal conviction,Gallivan said at a news conference. Only 1.5 percent of them ultimately go to state prison. So, I would make an argument that we are already treating them differently. Is Gallivan right on the numbers? A commission's report The senators data comes from a 2014 report by Gov. Andrew M. Cuomos Commission on Youth, Public Safety, and Justice. The commission convened to make recommendations on raising the age of criminal responsibility. The report shows about 33,000 cases resolved in 2013, with almost 2.7 percent receiving a sentence to state prison. That data has since been updated by the state Division of Criminal Justice Services, which reported close to 35,000resolved cases involving 16- and 17-year-old defendants in 2013. Only 1,689 cases, or 4.8 percent, resulted in a criminal conviction, according to the data. Some 5,215 other cases resulted in a youth offender adjudication, given when someone is found guilty but a judge seals the record at sentencing. In all, 838 cases resulted in a state prison sentence, 2.4 percent of the cases resolved that year. Some 1,808 cases, about 5 percent, resulted in a jail sentence for lesser convictions. Defendants in the remaining cases were either found not guilty or received different sentences like probation or a fine. Or else they received a conditional discharge, allowing them to avoid incarceration or other punishment as long as they complied with conditions set by the court. More recent data There were 24,572 cases resolved involving 16- and 17-year-old defendants in 2016. Only 1,012 cases, or 4.1 percent, resulted in a criminal conviction. Some 3,802 resulted in a youthful offender adjudication. The state said 581 cases, or 2.4 percent of all cases, resulted in a state prison sentence, while 1,072 cases resulted in a local jail sentence. Our ruling Gallivan, a former Erie County sheriff and captain in the State Police, said of 30,000 individuals arrested a year for crimes that are 16 or 17, over 95 percent of them do not result in a criminal conviction. Only 1.5 percent of them ultimately go to state prison. State data shows close to 96 percent of cases involving 16- and 17-year-old defendants did not result in a criminal conviction last year. Only 2.4 percent of these cases received sentences to state prison. That drops to less than 1.5percent if you exclude youth offenderadjudications.The state says both categories of offenders should be included in sentencing data. Gallivan is slightly off on the numbers, but his claim that few of these cases result in a conviction - and even fewer receive a state prison sentence - is correct. His statement is accurate but needs additional information.",0.8,0.2,1.0,0.7,0.0,0.1,0.3,0.9,0.7,mostly-true

Final Rating: Mostly True  ",Women of childbearing age spend 68 percent more in out-of-pocket health care costs than men.,"The Supreme Court recently decided Burwell vs. Hobby Lobby -- a landmark decision in which a 5-4 majority ruled that a closely held, private corporation could decline, on religious grounds, to pay for certain kinds of contraceptives otherwise mandated in employee health coverage by the Affordable Care Act. The decision was a victory for supporters of religious freedom and a defeat for backers of expanded reproductive health care. The unveiling of the decision on June 30, 2014, produced widespread commentary and debate over its merits. Associate Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburgs stinging dissent attracted wide attention from those who opposed the majority opinion. We noticed the following claim in Ginsburgs dissent: Women of childbearing age spend 68 percent more in out-of-pocket health care costs than men. We thought it would be interesting to see how that statistic was calculated. But when we looked into it, we were in for a surprise: The 68 percent figure was a lot older than wed expected. Where the statistic came from In her dissent, Ginsburg cited the statistic as being from a statement of Sen. Feinstein, which appears to refer to a Senate floor speech by Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif. During the debate on President Barack Obamas Affordable Care Act in December 2009, Feinstein said, The fact is, women have different health needs than men, and these needs often generate additional costs. Women of childbearing age spend 68 percent more in out-of-pocket health care costs than men. Most people don't know that, but it is actually true. The 68 percent statistic has been cited repeatedly in the judicial debate over the contraceptive mandate in the health care law. In the Hobby Lobby case alone, it was cited in briefs by the Obama administration, as well as in an amicus, or friend-of-the-court, brief by 91 Democratic members of Congress and a separate amicus brief by the National Womens Law Center. We found a flurry of references to the statistic in court cases, bills, and reports in 2014, 2013, 2012, 2009, 2003, 2002, 1999 and 1998. After a lot of digging, PolitiFact was able to trace the 68 percent figure back to a publication released by the Womens Research & Education Institute titled, Women's Health Care Costs and Experiences. That study was published in 1994 -- and if 1994 was the publication year, its reasonable to assume that the data in question are even older than that. (We couldnt find the full report online, and inquiries to the group and to the original author were not answered.) Is there newer data? Could Ginsburg -- or anyone else who cited the 68 percent statistic in recent years -- have used more up-to-date data? Yes. PolitiFact asked officials at the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality -- a part of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services -- to walk us through the data in the Medical Expenditures Panel Survey, which is the source several independent experts had suggested we use to test Ginsburgs statistic. It turns out that for 2011, women between 18 and 44 had out-of-pocket expenses that averaged 69 percent higher than men of the same age range. Thats virtually indistinguishable from what Ginsburg said. Still, its worth noting that alternative data comes up with somewhat lower estimates. Data from a different HHS source -- National Health Expenditure Accounts -- found that in 2010, women between 19 and 44 had 52 percent greater out-of-pocket spending than men of the same age range. And an annual study by the Health Care Cost Institute, which is based on information supplied by private health insurance companies, found an even smaller gender gap. In 2012, women's out-of-pocket expenses were 36 percent higher than men's. However, this figure is for all women through age 65, rather than just childbearing age, so its not an apples-to-apples comparison. The experts we checked with didnt doubt that women of childbearing age tend to pay more out of their pocket for health care. Women under 65 use a lot more health services than do men, especially preventive care, screenings and well-care, all of which is covered less by insurance than hospital expenditures, said Gail Wilensky, who headed Medicare and Medicaid under President George H.W. Bush. Still, there are indications that the gap is narrowing between men and women, perhaps because the insurance market has changed substantially over the past 20-plus years, with cost-sharing becoming much more significant than it was in 1994. The annual Kaiser Family Foundation/Health Research & Educational Trust study found a rising percentage of workers with employer-provided health coverage facing an annual deductible of $1,000 or more. The share of people in that category rose from 10 percent in 2006 to 38 percent in 2013 -- a far shorter time horizon than 20 years. Meanwhile, data from HHS national accounts series shows that out-of-pocket spending for men grew faster than it did for women between 2002 and 2010 -- a 3.9 percent growth rate for men, compared with 3.3 percent for women, Tanner said. The significance of an old statistic We cant be 100 percent sure that by citing Feinstein, Ginsburg was simply relying on a very old statistic without further checking. However, given the long history of the identical number being used, we suspect the statistic was repeated, in most or all cases, without being checked against more recent data. Ginsburg did not respond to an inquiry for this story sent through the Supreme Courts public information office; justices rarely if ever comment to the media. In any case, we found repeated mentions of this statistic by advocates, lawmakers and government officials without citing the original 1994 source, leaving the incorrect impression that the number was current. Our ruling Ginsburg wrote that women of childbearing age spend 68 percent more in out-of-pocket health care costs than men. Some estimates cited by a litany of politicians and advocates are based on 20-year-old data. But more recent data shows that women do still pay more out of pocket for health care than men do, with one estimate very close -- 69 percent -- and other estimates in the 40 percent to 50 percent range.",1.0,0.2,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.1,0.5,0.2,0.5,mostly-true

Final Rating: Mostly True  ",Says a portfolio managed by the Texas General Land Office earned 22 percent last year while the states emergency reserve account experienced a 1 percent gain.,"Criticizing a poke at his not releasing millions of dollars to support public schools, Texas Land Commissioner Jerry Patterson said that doing so might cut into double-digit returns on investments managed by the General Land Office.In a letter he made public Aug. 22, 2012, Patterson, a Republican, said that those who want him to transfer $300 million in investment earnings to the State Board of Education for school needs do not understand the value of keeping such money invested so the states education endowment, the Permanent School Fund, continues to gain value.A pro-Democratic group, Progress Texas, accuses Patterson of inappropriately hoarding the millions. Patterson counters that the School Land Board, which he chairs, has discretion over whether to transfer the money and, he told us by telephone, it has until September 2013 to decide. His spokesman, Jim Suydam, also told us by email that the board approved a resolution in early 2011 to release $250 million of earnings in both 2012 and 2013 to the State Board of Education.In his letter, Patterson said that draining off additional earnings as Progress Texas says he must is a bad choice... because last year the GLO-managed PSF earned 22 percent and, due to statutory liquidity requirements, the rainy day fund earned just 1 percent. He was comparing the portion of the Permanent School Fund managed by the land office to earnings on the states savings account, otherwise known as the Economic Stabilization Fund. If your family needed a quick infusion of cash, Patterson wrote, would you withdraw cash from the investment account earning 22 percent or the account earning 1 percent?Were not venturing that question, but wondered if Patterson made an accurate earnings comparison.Starting in 2005, the land office was given the authority to invest in real estate using proceeds received from selling lands or drawing on revenue from Permanent School Fund mineral leases and royalties, the agency notes on a web page. Professional fund management firms oversee the investments, the agency says, while the land board, consisting of the commissioner and two citizen appointees, manages the sale of Permanent School Fund land and mineral leases.To our inquiry, Suydam provided an agency report to the Legislature stating that through March 2012, the market value of the agencys investments made from the Permanent School Fund was $3.077 billion, about half of that reflecting externally managed direct real estate investments and nearly $1.2 billion attributable to short-term investments in the states treasury, which Suydam later said means money set aside so its on call for the agencys real estate investments.The report, dated Sept. 1, 2012, says that gross time-weighted returns on the portfolio in the 12 months through March amounted to nearly 22.9 percent, though that is without considering the short-term investments. Counting the cash-on-call portion, the report says, the time-weighted returns on the portfolio were 13.03 percent.Time-weighted returns?By email, Suydam told us the term describes a complex calculation that uses values for every day in the period being measured which, he said, explains why the 23 percent return shown for the real estate investments does not align with the 30 percent return that we calculated by comparing the market value of those investments at the end of March 2012 to the comparable figure at the end of March 2011.Asked how the earnings on real estate through March 2012 compare to recent 12-month periods, Suydam said such investments generated nearly 14 percent in market value in the 12 months through March 2011, but lost about 15 percent in the 12 months through March 2010.We checked on the rainy day funds earnings with Lauren Willis, spokeswoman for State Comptroller Susan Combs, who oversees state finances.Willis said by email that money in the reserve fund, created in 1988, is invested like other funds in the states treasury in stable, high-quality investments. In 2011, Willis said, the average yield on all those funds was 0.74 percent -- generating nearly $194 million in interest income including $51.9 million added to the rainy day fund. R.J. DeSilva, another Combs spokesman, said by email the rate of return might or might not have been about the same through the 12 months running through March 2012.In a telephone interview, we asked Patterson about why his letter mentions the higher returns on the real estate investments alone rather than also taking into account the lower returns influenced by the agencys cash-on-call funds.I dont count the cash, Patterson replied, because its not part of our investment portfolio.The land office, Patterson noted, is limited by law to managing just part of the overall education endowment. Suydam later said by email that as of the end of March, the market value of the agencys portion of the PSF, not including the value of minerals or state-owned land, was nearly $3.1 billion. He said the State Board of Education oversaw the funds remaining $25.6 billion.Our rulingPattersons reference to 22 percent in earnings over the 12 months running through March 2012 does not account for reduced earnings from nearly $1.2 billion in cash-on-call money supporting the agencys real estate investments. That clarification would be helpful, though it still seems reasonable, overall, to focus on the portion of the portfolio that would be expected to reap sizable gains. Separately, the claim seems to reflect the annual earnings on the rainy day fund, though the commissioners March-to-March time period does not match the calendar-year approach used by the state comptroller.",0.8,0.2,1.0,0.9,0.0,0.1,0.3,0.6,0.7,mostly-true

Final Rating: Mostly True  ","Says Paul Ryan voted for two wars that were unpaid for, voted for the Bush tax cuts that were unpaid for, voted for the prescription drug bill that cost as much as my health care bill -- but wasn't paid for.","In closed-door remarks to campaign supporters on April 14, 2011, President Barack Obama looked back in frustration at lengthy negotiations with Republicans over funding to keep the federal government operating.Obama opined, as a CBS News online story reported, that he expects Republicans to continue using the budget process to enact their political agenda under the guise of cutting spending.The president singled out U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis., the House Budget Committee chairman who has authored a long-term deficit-reduction plan.When Paul Ryan says his priority is to make sure, you know, he's just being America's accountant, trying to be responsible ...This is the same guy who voted for two wars that were unpaid for, voted for the Bush tax cuts that were unpaid for, voted for the prescription drug bill that cost as much as my health care bill -- but wasn't paid for, Obama told his supporters. So it's not on the level.In making the remark, Obama pointed to several big-ticket items approved during the Bush administration while Ryan was in Congress -- ones he says have helped drive the nations record deficits.Given the prominence of the protagonists and the timeliness of the comments, we decided to take a look at Obamas critique of Ryan.With the words, Obama is offering an opinion about how Ryan has framed his budget-cutting efforts. We cant fact-check the presidents opinion about Ryans message. But we can focus on the factual assertions, and try to put them into some context.We started with the White House, which declined to comment, saying the presidents remarks spoke for themselves.Lets look at the votes.There is no dispute Ryan voted for Afghanistan and Iraq war funding; for the major tax cuts enacted under President George W. Bush in 2001 and 2003 (and extended in 2010); and for the new Medicare prescription drug benefit created in 2003.All were big-ticket items.But Obama goes a step further to assert that all were unpaid for. Thats Washington parlance for bills not offset by corresponding spending cuts or tax increases elsewhere in the federal budget.Budget experts we consulted and the historical record confirm there were no direct offsets built into those bills.Obamas claim on the prescription drug bill was slightly different -- that it wasnt paid for and cost as much as my health care bill.Lets break this into two parts.Obama appears to refer to the gross outlays needed for the two landmark bills.For the Medicare prescription drug bill, passed in 2003 and effective in 2006, we found a range of cost estimates for 10 years: $395 billion to $720 billion. The official Congressional Budget Office estimate was the low end.That was at the time. Now, government estimates show the original cost projections were too high, perhaps by as much as 40 percent, said Jon Gabel, senior fellow in health care research at the National Opinion Research Center.Obamas health reform bill -- the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act -- was pricier, with estimates in the $800 billion to $1.4 trillion range. Ryan and Republicans opposed the bill.But the two measures were passed seven years apart, so inflation may be a factor.Paul Van de Water, a former Congressional Budget Office official who is now a senior fellow with the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, did an inflation-adjusted comparison and found the Medicare bill is probably two-thirds or three-quarters the cost of the Obama health care measure.That is, Obamas health care bill is still hundreds of millions of dollars more costly than the Medicare drug bill.So the president was off in equating the gross cost of the bills.On the offset question, the Medicare prescription drug bill, however, indisputably added to the federal deficit. It was not offset by new revenue or other spending cuts.In contrast, the official government estimate of the 2010 health care laws impact said it would actually reduce the deficit, in part because of the new taxes it enacts to help offset the cost of expanding health coverage.The source for that is the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.The CBOs estimate is hardly undisputed -- Ryan, other Republican leaders and various budget analysts have argued that the CBOs report was skewed by questionable assumptions given to it by the Obama administration. They contend the law would actually add to the deficit.Nevertheless, we -- and Congress -- have used CBO estimates as the gold standard on such matters. So Obama has a pretty firm leg to stand on in saying his health bill was paid for while the Medicare bill was not.That covers the details behind the presidents remarks. In this case, its important to put them into their proper context. We consulted several experts and sought Ryans take.Ryan was asked in a recent interview about Obamas citing the Medicare drug program, the two wars and the Bush tax cuts as major drivers of the deficit.He disagreed: We still had these enormous, building, unfunded liabilities, Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security -- I mean, the big drivers of our debt.His office sent us a defense of his votes on war funding, quoting his budget plan: Like all categories of government spending, defense spending should be executed with greater efficiency and accountability. But responsible budgeting must never lose sight of the fact that the first responsibility of the federal government is to provide for the defense of the nation.On the Bush tax cuts, Ryan aides said the congressman believes that we have deficits because Washington spends too much, not because Americans are taxed too little. He says the tax cuts helped fuel economic growth and bring in more tax revenue.Indeed, in December, Obama himself backed a compromise with Republicans, including Ryan, that extended the Bush tax cuts.Bottom line: Ryan has voted for massive new spending and so has the president, said Tad DeHaven, a budget analyst at the libertarian Cato Institute.Iraq war costs have topped $1 trillion, said Scott Lilly, former staff director for the House Appropriations Committee and now a research fellow at the left-leaning Center for American Progress. Neither Bushs war effort in Afghanistan nor Obamas escalation there has been paid for, both analysts noted.In April, both Obama and Ryan unveiled long-term deficit reduction plans in the neighborhood of $4 trillion over a decade or more.So where does this leave us?The president cherry-picked a handful of votes in an effort to show that Ryan is not pristine on the subject of the deficit.Obama got it right on Ryans support for the big-ticket bills, including war funding, Medicare prescription drugs and the Bush tax cuts. He was also on target in saying that none was offset or paid for by spending cuts or tax increases. Thats the main part of his claim.He was off the mark in asserting that one of the bills -- Medicare prescription drugs -- was as costly as his 2010 health care reform bill.That puts him at Mostly True.",0.8,0.2,1.0,0.7,0.1,0.3,0.5,1.0,0.9,mostly-true

Final Rating: Mostly True  ",The United States has the highest corporate tax rate in the free world.,"Pundits dont just disagree about what tax rates should be; they also disagree about how high they actually are. On Fox Newss The Five, hosts Bob Beckel and Eric Bolling came down on either side while discussing how the economy has fared under President Barack Obama. America has the most number of deductions available to corporations, Beckel said. They pay lower taxes than a lot of European countries do, and under Obama, I have not seen corporate taxes go up all that much. Just to fact-check you a little bit, responded Bolling, we have the highest corporate tax rate in the free world. Beckel repeated his point, then Bolling pointed towards Pfizer and Burger King going overseas for what he called tax inversion. Theyre going there specifically to capture a lower corporate income tax, said Bolling. We separately checked Beckels claim about deductions, but in this check, well see whether Bolling is correct that the United States corporate tax rate ranks as the highest in the free world. The rate in theory We decided to focus on the countries that belong to the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development, a group that includes most advanced, industrialized nations. That fits our bill for a proxy for the free world. Out of the 34 countries in the OECD, America ranks first with a 39.1 percent corporate tax rate, compared to an OECD average of 24.1 percent. The OECD figure is whats called the statutory rate, meaning the base rate applied to corporate profits. According to the Tax Foundation, two non-OECD countries -- the United Arab Emirates (55 percent) and Chad (40 percent) -- have a greater statutory rate than the United States. But the UAE is governed by a monarchy and Chad is a developing country, so we dont think they would fit into the free world category Bolling used. The rate in practice PolitiFact, our sister site, has looked at several variations on Bollings claim and ruled them Mostly True almost every time. The reason for the mostly qualifier is that companies arent actually taxed at the statutory rate. Tax deductions -- on health insurance, pensions, and investment returns, for example -- allow corporations to reduce the pool of taxable profits. So economists often look at what they call the effective tax rate, which experts have told us is just as valid a measurement of corporate tax rates as the statutory rate. But whereas the statutory rate is relatively straightforward and uncontroversial, different, reputable organizations have published very different estimates of the effective tax rate that corporations pay. The most recent estimate comes from the World Bank and International Finance Commission, which put the United States effective rate for 2014 at 27.9 percent. Thats second-highest behind New Zealand among OECD countries and 15th-highest among the 189 countries measured. In 2011, the Tax Foundation published a survey of 13 prior estimates of the United States effective tax rate from 2005 to 2011. All 13 studies pegged the U.S.s rate as above average, but none had the U.S. rate first overall. Another 2011 study by the Congressional Research Service put the U.S. effective rate at 27.1 percent, slightly lower than the OECD average of 27.7 percent. Taxes are convoluted Different studies disagree on effective corporate tax rates because corporate tax rates tend to vary widely depending on the industry, said Alan Viola, resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute. The biggest deduction that varies across countries is how generous the depreciation schedule is, said Alan Viard, resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute. When a business does an investment, equipment, a building, they dont normally get to deduct the whole cost that year. They have to do it over time. Faster is better, said Viard, but depreciation rates vary depending on what types of equipment a company is buying. Many studies also dont account for what the United States classifies as S-corporations, meaning businesses that pay tax through the individual income-tax system rather than the corporate income-tax system, Viard said. This represents about 30 percent of American companies, he said. So while effective tax rates are a good estimate of the corporate tax burden in the United States, particular businesses burden may vary. Our ruling Bolling said the United States has the highest corporate tax rate in the free world. He was referring to the statutory rate, meaning the rate before deductions. On that score, hes right: The United States does have the highest statutory rate among developed countries. However, the United States corporate tax rate doesnt appear to be the highest once deductions and other exclusions are taken into account. So Bolling is correct by one valid definition.",1.0,0.2,1.0,0.8,0.0,0.1,0.5,1.0,0.6,mostly-true

Final Rating: Mostly True  ",Says Donald Trump has bankrupt four separate businesses.,"U.S. Sen. Mark Warner says presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton has a lot of ammunition to fire at Donald Trumps business record. To think that Mr. Trump is trying to lay out this proposition that hes a successful business guy. Hes failed miserably, bankrupt four separate businesses, Warner, D-Va., said during a June 21 interview on CNN. We looked at Warners contention that Trump bankrupted four businesses. Clinton has made similar charges against the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, including on July 6 when she spoke in front of the shuttered Trump Plaza Casino and Hotel in Atlantic City, N.J.. Earlier this year, many of Trumps GOP primary opponents also accused him of running businesses into the ground. Kevin Hall, Warners communications director, sent us a series of media reports about Trumps business problems. Some Trump companies indeed have sought protection under Chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy law, which shields businesses from creditors as as they reorganize with hope of remaining open. Under court supervision, the companies devise a plan to pay back some of its liabilities over time. Thats different from a Chapter 7 filing, which involves liquidating a companys assets and distributing the proceeds to creditors. PolitiFact National has explored several claims about Trumps business record and has tallied a list of bankruptcies for his companies. Lets take a look. 1991 bankruptcy Trumps first bankruptcy came when he sought protection for the Trump Taj Mahal in Atlantic City. Trump funded most of the casinos $1 billion construction by using junk bonds with high interest rates, according to the Philadelphia Inquirer. When it sought Chapter 11 protection a year after its opening, the casino had about $3 billion in debt. As part of the restructuring, Trump cut his ownership stake in the Taj Mahal by half and sold his airline as well as his personal 282-foot yacht, The Washington Post said in an August 2015 story. 1992 bankruptcies Two more of Trumps Atlantic City casinos - the Trump Castle and Trump Plaza and Casino - sought Chapter 11 protection amid heavy debt and cash flow problems, United Press International reported at the time. A fourth bankruptcy also occurred in 1992 when Trump sought protection for The Plaza hotel in midtown Manhattan. The hotel, which Trump bought for $390 million in 1988, had accumulated more than $550 million in debt. Trump gave up a 49 percent ownership stake and remained CEO, although he had little control over the day-to-day operations of the company, according to The New York Times. Most recent bankruptcies Trump Hotels and Casinos Resorts filed for bankruptcy in 2004 when his casinos - including the Trump Taj Mahal, Trump Marina and Trump Plaza in Atlantic City, and a riverboat casino in Indiana - amassed an estimated $1.8 billion in debt, according to The Associated Press. Trump agreed to reduce his share in the company from 47 percent to 27 percent in a restructuring plan, but he still was the companys largest single shareholder and remained in charge of its operations. Several years later, Trump Entertainment Resorts - formerly Trump Hotels and Casinos Resorts - was slammed by the Great Recession and missed a $53.1 million interest payment in December 2008, according to ABC News. The company declared Chapter 11 in February 2009. After negotiating with the board of directors, Trump resigned as the companys chairman and had his corporate stake in the company reduced to 10 percent. The company continued to use Trumps name in licensing. All told, the record shows that three of Trumps Atlantic City casinos as well as The Plaza hotel went bankrupt in the 1990s. His overall casino and resort company went bankrupt twice in the 2000s while operating under different names. So you could argue that five Trump companies have gone into bankruptcy. Beyond the numbers The next question: Is Trump personally to blame for driving these ventures into bankruptcy, as Warners statement says? Trump defends his use of bankruptcy laws, saying theyve allowed him to keep businesses afloat and that hes rarely relied on them during a career of making hundreds of business deals. In a statement released the day Clinton made her Atlantic City trip, Trump pegged the number of bankruptcies at four.  It is an effective and commonly used practice in business to use bankruptcy proceedings to restructure a business and ultimately save jobs, Trump said in a July 6 statement.  Experts told PolitiFact National last September that Trump has had a high number of bankruptcies. But they didnt entirely blame him for the Chapter 11 filings and noted that most occurred in the gambling industry, which has struggled. A 1991 article by United Press International about the financial woes of the Trump Castle and Trump Plaza and Casino said the Atlantic City gaming industry was depressed and that nine of the citys 12 casinos saw declining revenues in 1990, with those two Trump casinos seeing the biggest revenue losses. The New York Times noted in a story earlier this month that Trumps share of the overall Atlantic City casino market started to fall in 1997, and that while revenues for non-Trump gaming ventures in the city rose over the following five years, revenue at Trump casinos declined. Trump told the newspaper that his casinos ran into trouble because they began competing against each other - a statement that The Times said was a tacit acknowledgement that he overbuilt. Roger Gros, publisher of Global Gaming Business magazine, told the Los Angeles Times last year that Trump put his Atlantic City casinos in so much debt that subsequent managers couldn't manage them properly. But Michael Viscount, an Atlantic City lawyer who represented unsecured creditors during the 2004 Chapter 11 filing of the Trump Hotels and Casino resorts, doesnt blame Trump for the bankruptcies. He told Forbes magazine in 2011 that he didnt blame Trump for his Atlantic City casino bankruptcies. Viscount said creditors knew what they were getting into when they lent Trump money. Theyve all played this game before, in the insolvency space. The company that possessed his name filed bankruptcy because it was overleveraged, Viscount told Forbes. What does that tell you? People want to lend him money. He does grandiose things with it. Adam Levitin, a law professor at Georgetown University, said in an August 2015 post on a blog dedicated to bankruptcy and credit issues that a Chapter 11 filing alone doesnt demonstrate a lack of business acumen. Sometimes businesses go bankrupt because of poor management, but sometimes its because of factors beyond their control, Levitin wrote. And indeed, how much, if at all, was Trump involved in the management of the companies? Levitin wrote. I wouldn't be shocked if he was basically licensing his name. Levitin told PolitiFact National last September that its not fair to put all the blame on Trump for his companys bankruptcies because hes acted as any investor would. Investors often own many non-integrated companies, which they fund by taking on debt, and some of them inevitably file for bankruptcy, Levitin said. The only difference is that Trump puts his name on his companies, which means people associate them with him, but he's not at all the leader in the bankruptcy space, Levitin said. These bankruptcies were not defining moments for Trump and shouldn't color our view of him. Our ruling Warner said Trump has bankrupt four separate businesses. The number, if anything, is conservative. We count five. But beyond the number, Warners statement also asserts that Trump was the cause of the bankruptcies, and thats harder to parse out. Theres no doubt he had a role in many of the failings, having larded his casino operations with huge debts. But analysts note that Trump wasnt acting alone; he had willing investors who put up big sums of money in the risky gaming industry. Theres also questions about how involved he was in running all of the casinos that bore his name.",1.0,0.2,1.0,0.8,0.1,0.2,0.5,1.0,0.8,mostly-true

To read the others, click here. El Paso Democrat Beto ORourke, who announced Thursday that he is running for president, had been teasing a presidential bid for weeks. Speculation about his intentions prompted the conservative Club for Growth to release a television ad looking to weaken enthusiasm for ORourke among Democratic primary voters. The ad argues that ORourke has coasted through life due to white male privilege and that he is a far cry from former President Barack Obama, as many have drawn comparisons between the two Democrats. Obama went on to become the first African American editor of the Harvard Law Review, breaking barriers, the ad says. Beto crashed into them, causing a collision while driving drunk, then fleeing the scene to avoid accountability. Club for Growth provided a fact sheet detailing the source for each statement in the advertisement. Sources include newspaper articles and other sources online. ORourke did not return a request for comment. OUR PROCESS: Read howPolitiFact checks everyone. Police report details accident We looked at this incident in September last year and earlier, after allegations about his 1998 arrest were made during his 2018 Senate campaign and his 2012 congressional campaign. Here are the facts: ORourke was arrested in 1998 for driving while intoxicated in Anthony, a small town in El Paso County. A witness told police officers that they saw ORourke driving at a high speed on I-10 before losing control of his car and striking a truck traveling in the same direction, according to a police report of the incident published by the Houston Chronicle. The truck was sent across the center median and into the lane moving in the opposite direction. ORourke then attempted to drive away, but the witness stopped him. Law enforcement arrived at the scene and arrested ORourke. Police reported that ORourke recorded a 0.136 and 0.134 on police breathalyzers, above a blood-alcohol level of 0.10, the state legal limit at the time. Our ruling Club for Growth said ORourke crashed into barriers, causing a collision while driving drunk, then fleeing the scene to avoid accountability. A police report of the incident states that ORourke crashed into another car while driving under the influence of alcohol. A witness said he attempted to flee the scene, but was unsuccessful.

Final Rating: Mostly True  ","Despite attention on global warming, fewer Americans carpool today to work than carpooled in 1980 and SUVs have never been a larger proportion of the vehicles being sold in this country.","The two-week climate conference now under way in Paris, where President Barack Obama hopes for an international agreement to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, has generated attacks from conservatives such as syndicated columnist George Will. On Nov. 30, 2015, the first day of the United Nations gathering, Will made a two-part claim that we want to check. He made the statement on Fox News Special Report, and it was replayed the next day by Milwaukee radio talk show host Charlie Sykes, whose guests are nearly always fellow conservatives. Despite 30 years of propaganda about global warming, Will stated, fewer Americans carpool today to work than carpooled in 1980. SUVs have never been a larger proportion of the vehicles being sold in this country. The American people may profess occasionally to be concerned about global warming, but their behavior tells you that none of this propaganda has had any effect. The size of the cars Americans drive and how often they carpool are only two ways in which people produce greenhouse gases -- those such as carbon dioxide from vehicles that trap heat in the atmosphere and, scientists believe, contribute to global warming. But lets see how clean Wills claim is. Greenhouse gases A little first on greenhouse gases. When Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker stated in September 2015 that the Obama administrations own Environmental Protection Agency has said its Clean Power Plan will have a marginal impact on climate change (Half True), we noted that the United States and China are considered the worlds top greenhouse gas polluters. And as PolitiFact National reported the same month, the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has said it is extremely likely that humans are causing climate change, and very likely that greenhouses gases are the driver.  Weve also noted that according to the EPA, greenhouse gas emissions from vehicles in the United States amount to 27 percent of all sources of greenhouse gases, second only to electric power generation. Now to the first part of Wills claim. Carpooling The latest census figures show that slightly more than 9 percent of Americans carpooled to work in 2014. As Will suggested, thats down from nearly 20 percent in 1980, which was the first census to survey about carpooling. Driving alone rose from 64.4 percent to 76.5 percent. Among the reasons, according to experts: The rate of car ownership has risen, work schedules are less predictable, more people work from home and busier Americans want more freedom in managing their commutes with other tasks, such as getting kids to soccer practice. The other part of Wills statement, however, goes off road a bit. SUVs Well note that, strictly speaking, there are traditional sport-utility vehicles, such as the Jeep Grand Cherokee and Dodge Durango, which are built on a truck platform; and the newer crossover-utility vehicles, which are built on a car chassis. They include the Honda CR-V and the Buick Encore. Traditional SUVs peaked with a 17 percent market share in 2002, according to the Ann Arbor, Mich.-based Center for Automotive Research, an independent research group. In 2014, they made up only 7.1 percent of all new vehicle sales. But many people, as well as automotive experts, refer to both types of vehicles simply as SUVs. The car site Edmunds.com told us that SUVs have reached their highest-ever market share in 2015, at 35.5 percent of sales. And the Center for Automotive Research provided us similar figures. In 2014, traditional SUVs and crossovers accounted for 34 percent of new-vehicle sales, as high as any year going back to 1995. Our rating Will said that despite attention on global warming, fewer Americans carpool today to work than carpooled in 1980 and SUVs have never been a larger proportion of the vehicles being sold in this country. Will is correct on carpooling to work and essentially correct on SUVs, when taking into account both traditional SUVs and the smaller crossover vehicles. But its worth noting that the market share for the traditional SUVs is down from its peak in 2002. ",0.7,0.5,1.0,0.7,0.0,0.5,0.6,1.0,0.6,mostly-true

Final Rating: True  ","Since that famous day in February where the governor campaigned with Barack Obama on behalf of the stimulus program, 211,000 Floridians have lost their jobs.","You knew it wouldn't take long for the hug to get some love during Sunday's debate between Republicans Marco Rubio and Charlie Crist. Minutes into the 40-minute Florida Senate Showdown, Rubio made a case that he'll stand up to President Barack Obama's agenda and Crist won't.Everyone knows that you won't stand up to the Obama agenda because just a year ago you were campaigning for it, the former House speaker said, referring to Feb. 10, 2009, when Crist embraced the president at a Fort Myers campaign event for the federal stimulus package.We've fact-checked several claims about Crist's support for the stimulus. Indeed, he earned a Pants on Fire rating for saying he didn't endorse it. So it was a Rubio comment later in the program that drew our attention. FOX News Sunday host Chris Wallace asked Rubio, Why is $8 billion and 87,000 jobs bad for a state that has 12 percent unemployment?Well ... if it's bad for America, it can't possibly be good for your state, Rubio said. Let me tell you why the stimulus has failed. The stimulus has failed because since that famous day in February where the governor campaigned with Barack Obama on behalf of the stimulus program, 211,000 Floridians have lost their jobs.211,000 is a big number, so we wanted to check Rubio's facts.Conveniently, the state's Agency for Workforce Innovation released a report on state employment figures just two days before the debate. In it, Florida's record 12.2 percent unemployment rate is announced, along with many statistics on the state's jobs picture, including year-over-year numbers from February 2009, the month Crist campaigned with Obama. The report shows Florida had 8,356,000 jobs in February 2009 and 8,125,000 in February 2010, the difference being 231,000. These are the seasonally adjusted numbers for the civilian population.However, if you look at seasonally adjusted nonagricultural employment --- a less-inclusive number --- you see the basis for Rubio's claim. There the job loss in a year's time is 211,500.It's the latter number that the Rubio campaign points to. Spokesman Alberto Martinez also shared a report from House Way and Means Republicans that seeks to highlight the stimulus as a job-killer, rather than a job creator, where Florida is said to have lost 240,400 jobs since the stimulus passed.Like any statistics, these are easily sliced and diced to make the key point. But Rubio is very close to the precise number, and in fact, he underestimates it slightly when his point is that Florida has lost a lot of jobs.

Final Rating: True  ","In Afghanistan, over 100 billion dollars spent on military contracts.","The debate over how the United States left Afghanistan, and the chaos it created, will likely last for years. So will the debate over the war itself, and whether nearly 20 years of deployment was worth it. Lt. Gov. Mandela Barnes of Wisconsin, one of at least 10 Democrats hoping to win the seat held by Republican U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson, made his position clear in an Aug. 16, 2021 tweet: Thousands of American lives lost, plus over 100,000 Afghan civilians and military personnel. Over 100 billion dollars spent on military contracts. And for what? The cost in human lives has been well documented. Here are the stark totals as reported that same day by The Associated Press: American service members killed in Afghanistan through April: 2,448. U.S. contractors: 3,846. Afghan national military and police: 66,000. Other allied service members, including from other NATO member states: 1,144. Afghan civilians: 47,245. Taliban and other opposition fighters: 51,191. Aid workers: 444. Journalists: 72. Those casualty totals tragically increased August 26, 2021, when a suicide bomber attacked crowds of Afghans flocking to Kabuls airport. The attacks killed at least 169 Afghans and 13 U.S. troops, Afghan and U.S. officials said. The death toll could rise as authorities examine the scene. On August 30, 2021, the last plane carrying U.S. forces left Afghanistan after 20 years of war. But were focused on the second part of Barnes tweet, and his claim about money spent on military contracts. Has more than $100 billion dollars been spent on military contracts? Lets take a look. When asked for back up for the statement, Barnes spokesman Christian Slater pointed us to a April 23, 2021 Bloomberg Law report which found that Since 2002, the Pentagon has spent $107.9 billion on contracted services in Afghanistan, a Bloomberg Government analysis shows. Contractor support includes lodging, laundry, private security, mechanics, food, transportation, equipment maintenance, and fuel, according to the article. Texas-based Fluor was the biggest defense contractor in Afghanistan. The Defense Department had spent $3.8 billion for Fluors work in Afghanistan since 2015, federal records show, mainly for logistics services, according to an Associated Press report. A Bloomberg report noted that in April 2021, 16,832 workers were employed by contractors in Afghanistan, with 6,147 of them being U.S. citizens. That was more than double the remaining 2,500 U.S. troops at the time. According to a July 21, 2021 US News & World Report article, the number of contractors in Afghanistan dropped over the previous three months from nearly 17,000 in April to 7,800 in July. Here is Bloombergs list of top Department of Defense contractors for fiscal years 2016-2021.  Fluor Corp.: $3.1 billion Amentum Parent Holdings: $1.7 billion Columbia Helicopters: $970 million PAE: $930 million Raytheon Technologies: $830 million Secure Movement Logistics: $680 million National Fuel: $480 million Boeing Co.: $400 million Bravura Information Tech.: $310 million FedEx Corp.: $310 million Waste and fraud reported To be sure, all that money was not spent without controversy -- or even all spent appropriately. In an August 2021 report on Afghanistan Reconstruction, Special Inspector General John F. Sopko, noted that fraud and financial waste was rampant: Because contract work was often performed with little to no oversight, waste and fraud often went virtually unchecked. In 2012, GAO reported that a number of new, contractor- built facilities had to be repaired or completely rebuilt because oversight personnel were unable to adequately measure contractors performance, resulting in wasted resources, low morale, and risks to safety of base and installation personnel where the deficient guard towers, fire stations, and gates were constructed.  Congress created the inspector generals office as an independent agency focused on the Afghanistan mission and its reconstruction issues. Of the approximately $145 billion the U.S. government spent trying to rebuild Afghanistan, about $83 billion went to developing and sustaining its army and police forces, according to the the office. The $145 billion is in addition to $837 billion the United States spent fighting the war, which began with an invasion in October 2001. Barnes said Over 100 billion dollars spent on military contracts. A Bloomberg Law report found that the Pentagon has spent $107.9 billion on contracted services in Afghanistan. Those contracted services include lodging, laundry, food, transportation, equipment maintenance and fuel. For a statement that is accurate with nothing significant missing, our rating is True.

Final Rating: True  ",Says Mitt Romney has flip-flopped on abortion rights.,"On Fox News Sunday, Texas Gov. Rick Perry said fellow Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney has changed positions on pivotal topics, including abortion rights. You go back through my record for 20-plus years, I have been a consistent conservative, Perry told Chris Wallace on Oct. 30, 2011. Perry said he has always been pro-life, while Romney has been on both sides of that issue. Hes been ... pro-abortion, Perry said. Perry has lobbed flip-flop charges at Romney, a former Massachusetts governor, since soon after entering the presidential race. During a Sept. 22 Republican presidential debate, Perry, in a halting verbal attack, hit that idea hard, saying that Romney previously had stood up for Roe v. Wade before he was against it. Perry was referring to the 1973 landmark Supreme Court ruling that struck down a Texas law prohibiting nearly all abortions and said states could not prohibit a woman from having an abortion before a fetus is viable, the time at which it can survive outside a woman's body. So, has Romney flip-flopped on abortion rights? For another fact-check, PolitiFact National looked into that question. Romney made several statements about abortion rights earlier in his political career. Here are two of his clearest statements about his position: • In a debate during his unsuccessful 1994 challenge to U.S. Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., Romney said, I believe that abortion should be safe and legal in this country. He added: I believe that since Roe v. Wade has been the law for 20 years, it should be sustained and supported. And I sustain and support that law and support the right of a woman to make that choice. • In his successful 2002 campaign for governor, Romney said during a debate, I will preserve and protect a woman's right to choose and am devoted and dedicated to honoring my word in that regard. Those comments — made in public forums eight years apart — struck us as solid evidence that Romney was then an abortion-rights supporter. What about his views today? The issues portion of his website doesnt have a section on abortion, but Romney wrote an op-ed that was posted on the National Reviews website June 18, 2011, presenting his abortion views. It was written after he risked alienating anti-abortion activists by declining to sign a pledge offered by the Susan B. Anthony List, an anti-abortion group. The pledge includes a promise that if the signer becomes president, he will appoint pro-life candidates to head certain federal agencies such as the Justice Department and to advance legislation cutting off funding to Planned Parenthood clinics and other abortion providers. In the op-ed, Romney wrote: I am pro-life and believe that abortion should be limited to only instances of rape, incest, or to save the life of the mother. I support the reversal of Roe v. Wade, because it is bad law and bad medicine. Roe was a misguided ruling that was a result of a small group of activist federal judges legislating from the bench. I support the Hyde Amendment, which broadly bars the use of federal funds for abortions. And as president, I will support efforts to prohibit federal funding for any organization like Planned Parenthood. Romney goes on to say that if he is elected president, he will push for a law to protect unborn children who are capable of feeling pain from abortion and appoint judges who adhere to the Constitution and the laws as they are written, not as they want them to be written. Our ruling Romneys views on abortion rights today are clearly different from what he expressed in 1994 and 2002. Most significantly, Romney earlier voiced support for the Roe decision; now, he says it should be reversed.",1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,true

Final Rating: True  ",Says Your kid just ate 16 packs of sugar.,"In recent days weve heard a revival of an age-old question that highlights our nations shared love of sugar yet calls out our regional differences: Is it pop or is it soda? Or maybe its just Coke? While in bubbly debate over what to call soft drinks -- your PolitiFact Oregon staff does not agree on this -- a colleague of ours suggested a potential fact check that anyone might find intriguing, no matter what they call their carbonated beverage of choice. Youve probably seen the Sugar Packs ads around Multnomah County, put there by the Health Department as part of a healthy living and anti-obesity campaign that started in 2010.Its the one with a pile of packets of white sugar draining into a 20-ounce bottle of generic cola. Your kid just ate 16 packs of sugar, the ad states. All those extra calories can bring on obesity, diabetes and heart disease.Sixteen packets? Our collective stomachs cramped. Our teeth ached. We swallowed our distaste and started checking.Soda-sleuthing turned out to be quite easy, namely because theres a lot of pop in a newsroom. In fact, we found more than a dozen empties within spitting distance. A 12-ounce can of Coca-Cola regular, we learned, contains 39 grams of sugar, usually from high-fructose corn syrup in the United States. A 20-ounce bottle would then contain 65 grams of sugar. Corn syrup is not the same as white table sugar, but the county is talking equivalents. A packet of table sugar as shown in the ad is equal to about a teaspoon, or about 4 grams of sugar. So, indeed, there are at least 16 packs of sugar in every 20-ounce bottle of regular cola.Theres no arguing that thats a large chunk of sweet. The American Heart Association recommends no more than nine teaspoons -- nine packets -- of added sugar a day for adult men. For women, its six.But just for the fun of it -- no, were not on a sugar high -- we wanted to know what else could contain the equivalent of 16 packets of granulated white. And bingo: A 16-ounce Jamba Juice Banana Berry contains 60 grams of sugar. A 12-ounce Chocolate McCafe shake from McDonalds has 76 grams.A Starbucks Grande non-fat, no-whip Caramel Frappucino Blended Beverage contains 59 grams of sugar, although to be fair, the drink also includes 4 grams of nutritious protein. The iced lemon pound cake contains 46 grams of sugar -- but then, all you adults knew that -- and PolitiFact Oregon has fallen into tangential research.Back to the point.We figure children dont usually indulge in diet sodas, which are made with artificial sweeteners like aspartame, and not with corn syrup or sugar. Were told by a beverage trade publication that 12-ounce cans are the top sellers -- but a 20-ounce bottle doesnt seem out of line in this age of super-sized drinks and Double Big Gulps.Its whats available in our environment, said Sonia Manhas, who manages the program for the county.After all, McDonalds markets a 16-ounce soda as a small-sized soft drink and a 12-ounce drink as child-sized. We figure parents are smart enough to figure out the sugar-gram-to-cola-ounce ratio themselves. The smaller the drink, the fewer the sugar packets.All this really means is that we find the countys statement accurate. And thats the unsugar-coated truth.",1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,true

Final Rating: True",Says COVID-19 has killed more North Carolinians in a year than the flu has in 10 years.,"Like many states, North Carolina is tracking a record number of COVID-19 cases this holiday season. And in an attempt to explain the severity of the illness, the states top health official compared coronavirus deaths to data on the flu. Sadly more than 5,000 North Carolinians have lost their lives from this virus since our first death on March 12 of this year, Health Secretary Mandy Cohen said during a Dec. 1 press conference. To give some perspective, just under 1,500 people died from the flu in the past 10 years, Cohen said. In just 11 months, Covid has killed more than three times that number. Is it true that the coronavirus has killed more North Carolinians in a year than the flu has in 10 years? According to the states data, yes. North Carolinas Department of Health and Human Services tracks both COVID-19 and influenza deaths. As of Wednesday morning, the state had counted 5,284 COVID-19 deaths. DHHS says those deaths include people who have had a positive molecular or antigen test for COVID-19, who died without fully recovering from COVID-19, and who had no alternative cause of death identified. The deaths are reported by hospitals and clinicians directly to the local and state health departments. The first reported COVID-19 death did, indeed, occur on March 12. The states health department also tracks flu deaths and reports each flu seasons data on its website. Flu deaths are reported by health providers and were confirmed as influenza by an appropriate laboratory or rapid diagnostic test. PolitiFact reviewed the last 10 flu seasons, dating back to the 2010-2011 season. In total, we counted 1,486 reported flu deaths. DHHS spokeswoman Kelly Haight confirmed to us by phone that our total is accurate. Heres a list of the flu death counts by season, and a link to the report for each respective season: 2019-2020: 186 2018-2019: 203 2017-2018: 391 2016-2017: 218 2015-2016: 59 2014-2015: 218 2013-2014: 107 2012-2013: 59 2011-2012: 9 2010-2011: 36 The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention also tracks flu deaths by state. At a glance, it might seem like the CDC and North Carolina reports contradict one other. For instance, the CDC reported North Carolina had 2,064 flu deaths in 2018, while the states health department reported far less. Thats because the CDC sometimes combines flu and pneumonia deaths together, officials said. Under the flu & pneumonia section on the CDCs flu deaths by state website, most of those deaths are pneumonia deaths, said Jeff Lancashire, acting associate director for communications for the CDCs National Center for Health Statistics. Some pneumonia deaths are caused by the flu, but some can be caused by many other viruses, bacteria, bacteria-like organisms and fungi, said Kelly Haight, DHHS spokeswoman. The year 2018 is the most recent year of flu deaths available on the CDC site. If you start in 2018 and look back 10 years to 1999, Lancashire said there were 1,806 deaths from exclusively flu alone – without pneumonia (from the public database CDC WONDER – wonder.cdc.gov). So if Dr. Cohen was citing deaths from flu alone, she would be correct that COVID19 deaths have exceeded that (number) in NC, he said. The CDC has noted, however, that tallying death counts for COVID-19, flu and pneumonia is complicated and sometimes its data can be incomplete. Cohen said COVID-19 has killed more North Carolinians in a year than the flu has in the last 10 years. By the North Carolina health departments count, there have been 5,200 COVID-19 deaths this year and 1,486 flu deaths over the last decade. Cohens claim also tracks with data collected by the CDC, according to an agency spokesman. However, the CDC points out that exact numbers can be tricky to count because there are sometimes delays in processing death information.",1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,true

Final Rating: True  ",Says the state budget includes spending on commercials for Fortune 500 companies.,"State Rep. David Simpson says the state budget lawmakers sent to Gov. Rick Perry spends money in the wrong places — such as on Walmart commercials.Despite conservative boasts of cost cutting, not raising taxes and not using the Economic Stabilization Fund, or rainy day fund, the budget still preserves about $500 million of pork for special interests including film and music makers, video games and commercials for Fortune 500 companies, the Longview Republican said in a June 5 op-ed in the Longview News-Journal.Its well-reported that the state promotes music, film and even video games. But this is the first weve heard about funding TV spots for the top 500 U.S. companies that Fortune magazine ranks by revenue every year.To back up the statement, Simpson aide Michael Bullock noted that the 2012-13 budget the House approved on May 28 appropriates $32 million for film and music marketing, a program overseen by the governors office. The budget provides $16 million each year to market Texas as a film location and promote the Texas music industry, according to the May 26 House-Senate conference committee report.What does that have to do with Fortune 500 TV spots?Bullock pointed us to a March report by the Texas state comptroller analyzing the states economic development incentives for 2010. According to the report, lawmakers in 2007 revised the Film Industry Incentive Program, created in 2005, so its grants could be extended to companies working in the entire moving image industry, sweeping in makers of commercials, TV programs and video games.In 2009, the Legislature appropriated $64 million in incentives for the biennium.According to the report, from April 2009 through August 2010, the Texas Film Commission approved 152 applications to help fund the production of commercials, awarding $2 million to grantees who, all told, said theyd spend $37.4 million in Texas.And did any of the commercials promote Fortune 500 companies? The report lists a handful.As of Aug. 31, the company Action Figure No. 1. Inc., had received more than $8,000 for an AT&T television commercial, which was one of three commercials made for AT&T, a Fortune 500 company, by three different companies using state grants totaling about $25,600, the report says. Also, the company Radical Media received $32,000 in grant money to make a commercial for Walmart, another Fortune 500 company, and the company Modern Times received $11,133 to make a commercial for the TV show Friday Night Lights. That show aired on NBC, a network owned by the Fortune 500 company General Electric.We wondered if each Fortune 500 company benefits from grants going to separate production companies. Perry spokeswoman Lucy Nashed told us the grants can go to either the production company, advertising agency or the client — such as a Fortune 500 company — involved in a supported TV ad. Lastly, we turned to the Texas Film Commission, which says on its website that certain commercials — such as ads for state agencies or those that portray Texas negatively — arent eligible for incentives.Otherwise, state law permits incentives for a TV commercial project of up to 5 percent of the amount spent on the project in the state, according to the commission. To qualify, the maker must spend at least $100,000 in Texas, at least 60 percent of its shooting days must be completed in the state and at least 70 percent of the paid crew, cast and extras must be Texas residents.Nashed told us TV commercial projects will continue to be eligible for incentives in 2012-13.",1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,true

Final Rating: True  ",There are more job openings than there are people on unemployment in Iowa.,"Democrats were quick to criticize Iowas Republican Gov. Kim Reynolds when Reynolds announced on Tuesday, May 11, that the statewill stop takingfederal funds for supplemental $300 payments to Iowans receiving unemployment benefits. The shift away from that COVID-19-related federal aid program, which means an end to the payment to out-of-work Iowans, is to take effect after June 12, 2021. The announcement came one day after an Iowa Workforce Development memorandum that said Iowa has a workforce shortage, which led Rep. Lindsey James (D-Dubuque) tostate on Twitter: There are more job openings than there are people on unemployment. Lets name the real problem here – Iowa needs higher wages. #ialegis More available jobs than people on unemployment to fill them? Yes, that is what theIowa Workforce Development report, from director Beth Townsend to Reynolds, states. Iowa had 60,900 unemployed workers in March for a 3.7 percent unemployment rate, that report stated, relying on U.S. Bureau of Labor Statisticsdata. More than 66,000 job openings showed up on the IowaWORKSwebsiteon May 10, Townsend wrote in the memorandum. Claims, continued and initial, continue to trend down, Townsends memorandum stated. Terminating the federal unemployment programs will not affect individuals eligible for regular state unemployment insurance claim benefits. Republicans, backed by business owners and trade groups,have arguedthat employers are having difficulty attracting workers in Iowa because of the jobless benefits money those prospective workers are receiving.The overwhelming message we receive from employers these days is the lack of workforce that is adversely affecting their ability to recover from the pandemic, Townsend said in a statement released by the governors office. Democrats, like James, counter that employers need to offer higher wages. Iowa had a labor shortage pre-COVID and it has continued now that we are recovering from COVID,James wrote in an email to PolitiFact Iowa.Moreover, she wrote,Iowa has more job openings that arent on the IowaWORKS website. Registered nursing jobs are most in demand in Iowa, the IowaWORKS website shows, but those jobs require special training and are an example of job requirements and pay disparity that exists. Other jobs, such as wait staff that Iowa restaurant owners toldThe Gazettenewspaper in Eastern Iowathey need, dont require the specialized college education a registered nursing job needs. Wait staff starting pay is around$8.45an hour, far less than the$23.84an hour entry pay for registered nurses in Iowa, state wage data show. After hearing about pandemic-related layoffs and job cuts the past year, seeing that more people are seeking jobs in Iowa than are taking unemployment benefits might surprise some. But the numbers back it up and both sides of the argument on what Iowa should do about unemployment benefits do not dispute it.

Final Rating: True  ",The potential Iran nuclear agreement would limit Iran to the number of centrifuges needed for a weapon but too few for a nuclear power program.,"The deadline for an agreement on Irans nuclear program is something of a moving target,but right nownegotiators need to wrap things up by June 2015. The five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council — China, France, Russia, the United Kingdom and the United States — along with Germany, have until then to strike a deal with the Islamic republic. If all goes the way the United States hopes, a signed agreement will keep Iran out of the nuclear weapons club. For now, the two sides are operating under an interim agreement, which rolls back Irans stock of enriched uranium and freezes the countrys capability to produce nuclear materials that could be used to make a nuclear bomb. In exchange, Iran can sell its oil more freely and gain access to millions of dollars in frozen assets. One element thats fully expected in a long-term arrangement is a limit on the number and kinds of centrifuges Iran can use to enrich uranium. Former CIA deputy director Michael Morell said theres an irony in that. If you are going to have a nuclear weapons program, 5,000 is pretty much the number you need, Morell, now a CBS analyst, said on Charlie Rose. If you have a power program, you need a lot more. By limiting them to a small number of centrifuges, we are limiting them to the number you need for a weapon. Morell told PunditFact he said 5,000 because that was lowest number he had heard was in play. The number of centrifuges in place today is a hair over 20,000, and a likely goal is to cut that to about 5,000. But Morells basic point struck us as just plain intriguing. We wanted to learn more about this idea that a nuclear power program would require many more centrifuges than youd need for a bomb -- which by extension means that limiting centrifuge capacity is just onenegotiating point out of many. The consensus among the experts we reached is that Morell is on the money. Matthew Kroenig at Georgetown University told PunditFact the Morell is is absolutely correct. Ditto for Daryl Kimball of the Arms Control Association and David Albright of the Institute for Science and International Security. Matthew Bunn at Harvard agreed with his colleagues.  People think surely you must need a bigger enrichment system to make 90 percent enriched material for bombs than to make 4-5 percent enriched material for power reactors, Bunn said. But exactly the opposite is true. Bunn said there are two reasons. First, you need tens of tons of material to fuel a power reactor for a year, but just tens of kilograms to make a bomb. According to the International Atomic Energy Agency, the threshold amount for a bomb is about 25 kilograms of the most highly enriched U-235. And while yes, its harder to make 90 percent enriched uranium (bomb) than 4-5 percent enriched uranium (power), its not that much harder, Bunn said. The toughest part in the process comes when you start with the raw uranium. By the time youve brought that to 4-5 percent, youve already done more than 2/3 of the work of going all the way to 90 percent U-235 for weapons, Bunn said. So the amount of work needed to make bomb material is only a modest amount more per kilogram, and the number of kilograms you need for bombs is 1,000 times less. Bottom line: Making bombs takes fewer centrifuges. And without a lot of centrifuges, its hard to make nuclear power. For the record, some centrifuge modelsare better than others, so that's also a factor. Today, Iran has just one nuclear power station, the plant at Bushehr that it bought from the Russians. To keep that facility running, Iran would need to increase its centrifuge capacity ten-fold. A steady supply of fuel from Russia is what keeps Bushehr online. Centrifuges and a nuclear deal This fact that bombs require fewer centrifuges than power is a source of frustration for Albright, a physicist with the Institute for Science and International Security. I wish it were reversed, he told us. Then we could easily tell if the program was for weapons. As the clock clicks down to reach an agreement, the number of centrifuges and their level of sophistication will draw a lot of scrutiny. Kimball, of the Arms Control Association, said the specific terms on this front will have to resolve a crucial question: What are Irans practical needs, and how do you square that with international concern about the real purpose? Ideally, Kimball said, Russia or another nation would continue to supply the fuel, but barring that, the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council and Germany aim to put on cap on the number of centrifuges for as many years as possible. Allowing about 5,000 would help. With that, it would take 12 months for Iran to produce enough material for one bomb, Kimball said. That would give you enough time to detect that activity. But Bunn underscored that an agreement would have many moving parts and a key element would be the number of years that Iran agreed to rein in its centrifuge capacity. Because the sides have already agreed in the (interim agreement) that after the agreement expires, Iran is to be treated like other parties to the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. That would mean it could build up its enrichment capacity to have enough to fuel Bushehr or even more reactors, Bunn said. The variables dont stop there. If Iran ramped up production of fuel for nuclear power, it would need a ready supply of raw ore, which it might need to purchase on the international market. During his interview with Charlie Rose, Morell warned that the focus on declared centrifuges is misplaced, because he expects that if Iran were to try to build a bomb, it would do so in secret. The only protection against that, Morell said, is unannounced inspections at any place in the country at any time. Our ruling Morell said that it takes fewer centrifuges to make bomb-grade nuclear material than it does to supply fuel for a nuclear power plant and argued that the focus on centrifuges can go too far. That argument aside, experts agreed that Morrell has his facts right. A power plant requires tons of fuel each year. A bomb requires about 25 kilograms of U-235 enriched to the 90 percent level. If an agreement limits Iran to about 9,000 centrifuges, that would be sufficient to produce enough bomb-grade material but would leave Iran well short of the capacity to generate fuel to power nuclear power plants.",1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,true

Final Rating: True  ","Under Mayor Tom Barrett, the number of Milwaukee police officers has not increased.","Milwaukee Ald. Bob Donovan, a candidate for mayor in 2016, worries that upcoming retirements could further reduce what he sees as an undersized police force under Mayor Tom Barrett. In his state of the city speech Feb. 24, 2014, Barrett noted he had added 120 new officers in his 2014 budget. Donovan hit on that number when interviewed in the wake of his mayoral announcement. The reality is the number of officers has not increased, Donovan said during a July 29, 2014 appearance on the Charlie Sykes show on WTMJ-AM. Now the mayor will continue to say were hiring 120 cops this year. That doesnt take into consideration the fact that weve had 150 retirements, or that we havent filled positions going way back. When we asked Donovan about the comment, he did not cite hard numbers, but told us he figures unfilled positions and retirements have outstripped the addition of recruits over the 10 years Barrett has been in office. Is Donovan right? Has police strength -- at least by the numbers -- been flat or gone down on Barretts watch? To answer that question, we turned to the citys Fire and Police Commission, which issues an annual report that details the size of the overall force. To be sure, the actual number of bodies on the force on any given date is constantly changing, since retirement dates vary while recruit classes mean a wave of new bodies joins the force at once. The Fire and Police Commission reports, available online, are as close to an official tally of police strength as we found. They list, by race and gender, the number of persons on the Police Department payroll as of the last pay period of each year. The latest covers 2012, so we obtained figures for 2013 and so far in 2014 directly from the commission. We used 2004 as the pre-Barrett baseline for our comparisons, because Barrett didnt take office until spring 2004 and therefore did not propose the budget for that year. All figures factor in retirements, terminations and new hires. Police officers At the end of 2004, 1,402 police officers were on the payroll. That number fell to 1,357 by the end of 2013, a 3 percent drop. By that measure -- the one the public sees -- Donovan is correct that officer strength has not increased. Barrett administration officials note it can be misleading to look only at strength of force at any one point in time. A new class of officer recruits came on line in late 2004, boosting the number, they said. A comparison of pay period one in 2004 to the same period in 2014, for example, actually shows a small increase in officer strength. A better measure than point in time comparisons, they said, is average strength across the whole year. That was 1,349 in 2004, they said, and based on the first half of 2014 its 1,341 now -- a smaller decline. Still, that approach does not change the accuracy of Donovans claim. Total sworn officers City officials often will refer to this larger figure when discussing officer strength, and Donovan did as well when we contacted him. It includes not only patrol officers but detectives, supervisors, various technicians and specialists as well as the police chief and the top command staff. At the end of 2004, the figures show 2,006 sworn officers were on board. That number fell to 1,828 by late 2013 and to 1,875 by mid-July 2014. Earlier in 2004, according to Barretts budget staff, the figure was 1,932. And Barretts office released figures using the average strength throughout the year that show a smaller drop in overall sworn strength. Again, those figures change the angle of descent, but not the downward direction of the trend. Within those numbers, the detective ranks fell by more than one fourth. So by this broader measure, Donovan is on target again. Ten-year trend The staff strength figures from the Fire and Police Commission show that the police officer ranks grew early in Barretts tenure, but have slipped gradually with one exception since then.  Year 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 P.O.s* 1,402 1,362 1,390 1,441 1,406 1,392 1,362 1,348 1,384 1,357 1,345** As for the broader sworn ranks, a similar trend is evident. By way of explaining the lack of growth in the police force, Barrett chief of staff Patrick Curley and city budget officials said state shared-revenue aid to Milwaukee has dropped by $25 million since 2004 while the police budget is $65 million higher. They said the department under Chief Edward Flynn has re-deployed officers from administrative tasks to community policing. That was accomplished by hiring more civilians to do those desk jobs, they said. Efficiencies have helped avoid layoffs seen in some big cities, Barrett spokeswoman Jodie Tabak said. The Barrett officials told PolitiFact Wisconsin that our inquiry for this fact check led the mayor to quickly unveil a proposal to add 15 more officers to a training class that will graduate in April 2015. It already had been under consideration to announce later this year, they said. The mayor will propose his 2015 budget in September. Our rating Donovan said the number of Milwaukee police officers has not increased under Mayor Tom Barrett. Donovans claim is on target because reports from the citys Fire and Police Commission indicate a decline in the number of officers since 2004. And other measuring sticks offered by Barretts office show the same trend.",1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,true

Final Rating: True  ","The status quo led the General Assembly to reduce pension payments four straight years starting in 2005, costing billions of dollars as the delay in contributions essentially borrowed from pension funds at a very high interest rate.","Illinois Gov. Bruce Rauner has been pushing for changes to the states pension funds since he first began running for governor in 2013. His proposed FY 2016 budget suggested moving all state employees into a pension plan with lower benefits. He moved away from that approach once the Illinois Supreme Court declared unconstitutional a law that sought changes to pension benefits. He hasnt, however, stopped blaming the Illinois General Assembly, with its Democratic majorities, for contributing to the states mushrooming pension debt. As he launched an extended media crusade this year, Rauner said legislators who approved pension contribution breaks from 2005 to 2009 cost state workers and taxpayers billions. The status quo led the General Assembly to reduce pension payments four straight years starting in 2005, Rauner wrote in Springfields Capitol newspaper, costing billions of dollars as the delay in contributions essentially borrowed from pension funds at a very high interest rate. For several years now, Illinois has had the dubious distinction of having the worst pension debt in the nation. Illinois current debt was listed at $129.8 billion in November by the state General Assemblys bipartisan Commission on Government Forecasting and Accountability.  We decided to dig in to Rauners claim that reducing payments cost billions and was like borrowing at high interest rate. Borrowed time A 2013 settlement Illinois officials made with the federal Securities and Exchange Commission confirms the reduced pension payments for the four years in question, said Laurie Cohen, senior analyst with the Institute for Illinois Fiscal Sustainability at the Civic Federation, a nonpartisan government finance research group. The SEC said that despite state claims that pension holidays would be offset by increased fund contributions from 2008 to 2010, a 2005 amendment allowed lawmakers to skip increasing contributions to make up for the pension contribution holidays. The SEC settlement document underscores Rauners claim that the delay in contributions exacerbated the state pension funds condition. Although the State disclosed the basic fact of these reduced contributions, it reads, the State did not disclose that each of these deviations exacerbated the Structural Underfunding, deferred contributions further into the future, impaired the ability of the State to meet its pension obligations, and negatively impacted the States creditworthiness. Daniel Hertz, a senior policy analyst with the progressive Center for Tax and Budget Accountability, agreed Rauners claim was supported by the facts. In an email, Hertz said, The legislation Rauner referenced did have the effect of reducing pension contributions below what they otherwise would have been for four years, and that additional underfunding was, essentially, borrowing that increased costs down the line. According to a 2006 COGFA report, Hertz said, the net effect of the law was to increase pension payments from the State by $6.8 billion between FY2006 and FY2045. Our ruling In an opinion piece published by a Springfield newspaper, Republican Gov. Bruce Rauner said lawmakers in the Illinois General Assembly authorized reduced pension payments from 2005-2009. He said those lowered contributions cost billions and were akin to borrowing from the funds at a high interest rate. The General Assemblys own finance agency and a federal settlement with the SEC confirms four years of reduced contributions. The SEC said the move aggravated the funds condition and ability to meet its obligations and worsened its creditworthiness. A 2006 report said the underfunding required $6.8 billion more in payments.",1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,true

Hillary Clinton during the April 16 Democratic debate ruled out meeting with Iran's President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. As she criticized the Bush administration for failing to deter Iran from pursuing its nuclear program, Clinton said Ahmadinejad's most recent inflammatory remarks would make it impossible for her to speak with him directly. I certainly would not meet with Ahmadinejad because even again today he made light of 9/11, and said that he's not even sure it happened and that people actually died, Clinton said. Ahmadinejad, who has a history of provocative statements on such things, including saying the Holocaust was a fake, did indeed, question the U.S. version of the events of 9/11 on three occasions in just over a week. He said U.S. claims about being attacked were a pretext for military action against Iraq and Afghanistan. Four or five years ago a suspect event took place in New York, Ahmadinejad said in an April 16 speech in the holy city of Qom that was broadcast live on state television, according to Agence France Presse. A building collapsed and they said that 3,000 people had been killed, whose names were never published. Under this pretext they (the United States) attacked Afghanistan and Iraq and since then a million people have been killed. Ahmadinejad first expressed his doubts about the attacks on April 8 at a ceremony in the holy city of Qom celebrating Iran's nuclear program, which U.S. officials worry could be used to make weapons. He questioned how aircraft could have evaded radar and intelligence and crashed into the twin towers undetected. Ahmadinejad repeated his doubts the next day at a speech at a Shiite holy shrine in the city of Mashhad, according to press accounts. Iran condemned the attacks soon after they occurred. The government at the time was headed by moderate President Mohammad Khatami. Ahmadeinejad has been given to bellicose pronouncement in the past and provoked a global outcry when he described the Holocaust as a myth. During his controversial visit to the United States in September 2007, Ahmadinejad, when asked about the death penalty Iran imposed on homosexuals, denied there were homosexuals in Iran. He has repeatedly called for Israel's destruction. On Wednesday, he reaffirmed his intention to change the international order, Agence France Presse reported. We have two missions, Ahmadinejad proclaimed. To construct Iran and change the global situation. It is impossible to reach the summits of progress without changing the corrupt and unjust order of the world. Tehran insists its nuclear program is peaceful and intended to expand energy supplies for a growing population. The statement may be startling, but it's true. Clinton accurately summarized Ahmadeinejad's recent comments about 9/11. We judge her statement to be True. ",1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,true

Final Rating: True  ",Says Mitt Romney suggested that employers should be able to make the decision as to whether or not a woman gets contraception through her insurance coverage.,"President Barack Obama and Republican candidate Mitt Romney clashed over contraceptives coverage in their second debate, with Romney ultimately declaring, the president's statement of my policy is completely and totally wrong.That sounded like a request for some fact-checking.So, was Obama totally wrong?The issue emerged in the Oct. 16, 2012, debate at Hofstra University after a question from the audience about how the candidates intended to fix income inequality for women.Obama touted signing the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, then said: Romney later responded: It's worth noting that they were talking past each other. Obama was referring to whether an employer should dictate whether employees insurance covers contraceptives. Romney sidestepped the issue about insurance coverage and said he opposes a different concept — whether employers can tell someone whether they can have contraceptive care.For this fact-check, were asking whether Romney has suggested that employers should be able to make the decision as to whether or not a woman gets contraception through her insurance coverage.The Blunt amendmentObamas support for his claim centers on something called the Blunt amendment.Early this year, congressional Republicans made a big push to roll back a provision by Health and Human Services under Obamas health care law that requires most employers to provide birth control coverage without any out-of-pocket costs, with a limited exception for certain religious institutions.In the Senate, Sen. Roy Blunt, R-Mo., sponsored an amendment that would exempt employers from providing any service that went against their beliefs or moral convictions. At the time, the issue put the Obama administration on the defensive and the president himself appeared at the White House briefing room to explain a work-around for religious affiliated hospitals, universities and the like.A few weeks later, with a vote on the Blunt amendment pending, Romney was asked where he stood. He told a Boston radio interviewer Of course I support the Blunt amendment.CNSnews.com, a conservative news service, put the question directly to the Romney campaign.Will Mitt Romney, on day one, rescind this mandate in its entirety — as the Catholic Church has urged the current administration to do — so that individuals, employers and insurers who have a moral or religious objection to contraception or sterilization will not be forced to violate the tenets of their own faith or act against their consciences?Romney campaign spokesman Ryan Williams responded: Yes. Gov. Romney would rescind the mandate in its entirety.In April, Romney reiterated his opposition to the rule at a meeting of the National Rifle Association. He said, As president, I will abolish it.So the Obama campaign argues if Romney supports an employers ability to decline to provide a service that goes against beliefs or moral convictions, that means he supports employers making the decision as to whether or not a woman gets contraception through her insurance coverage.Romneys responseWe asked the Romney campaign to explain his objection to Obamas claim. Here's a statement from spokeswoman Andrea Saul: The statement acknowledges that Romney opposes a nationwide mandate for contraception coverage. In the absence of a federal mandate, that would sometimes leave the decision to employers whether to offer coverage for birth control.(Before Obamacare, some 27 states already required such coverage, though were not sure how many had religious exceptions.)Our rulingObama said Romney suggested that employers should be able to make the decision as to whether or not a woman gets contraception through her insurance coverage.Romney says he doesnt believe bureaucrats or employers should make the call whether a woman can use contraceptives. But his support for the Blunt amendment endorses the approach that employers should be able to make the decision about whether contraception is covered by employees insurance.",1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,true

Final Rating: True  ",Says Central Texas river water sent to downstream rice farmers in 2011 equaled about three years worth of Austins water use.,"Austin-area residents worried about drought might rue an agencys 2011 decision to let thousands of gallons of water from the Highland Lakes flow past the capital to downstream farmers, the head of the Austin Water Utility said. A May 27, 2014, news story said: Massive releases of water to rice farmers downstream that greatly reduced lake levels in 2011, the single driest year in Central Texas history, didnt help either. The story--by StateImpact Texas, a collaboration of KUT Austin and KUHF Houston--then quoted Greg Meszaros, the utilitys director, as saying: Comparison-wise, about three years worth of Austins water use was sent to rice farmers that year. That much? Asked the basis of Meszaros comparison, utility spokesman Daryl Slusher referred to annual reports on water use from the Lower Colorado River Authority, which oversees water releases from the chain of man-made lakes along the Colorado River running through Austin: Buchanan, Inks, LBJ, Marble Falls, Travis and Austin. By email, Slusher said the reports show that in 2011, the latest year the authority sent water downstream to rice farmers, the provided water was three times the amount of water used by Austin in 2011, 2012 or 2013. According to the authoritys March 30, 2012, report on water use in 2011, the authority that year released 529,580 acre-feet in water for downstream agricultural purposes, including rice farming. That broke down to 433,251 acre-feet let go from the Highland Lakes plus 96,329 acre-feet of water used by farmers from the river alone, the report says. An acre-foot, 325,851 gallons, is roughly equal to the water used by three average Austin households in a year. And the 529,580 acre-feet of water that went to farmers compares to Austin using 168,334 acre-feet of water that year, the report states, including 61,712 acre-feet diverted from the Colorado River at Lake Austin and 106,622 acre-feet obtained from the Highland Lakes under a city contract with the authority. This result suggests the water released to farmers was equal to a little more than three times what Austin used that year. Also, Slusher pointed out that according to the authority, Austin used less water in 2012 (151,495 acre-feet) and even less again (142,027 acre-feet) in 2013, widening the 3-to-1 ratio for those years. Another way to suss Meszaros claim, Slusher wrote, lies in adding up the last three years worth of Austins water use, which gets us 461,856 acre-feet, or 13 percent less than the 529,580 acre-feet released to farmers in 2011. Our ruling Meszaros said billions of gallons of river water released to downstream rice farmers in 2011 equaled about three years worth of Austins water use. Equaled or exceeded is the long and short of it. TRUE – The statement is accurate and theres nothing significant missing.

Final Rating: True","Rep. Paul Ryan's budget proposal cuts nothing from Medicare, Social Security or defense in the next two to three years, and in three years, he does not cut one dime from the debt.","President Ronald Reagan's former budget director, David Stockman, has taken on a new public role calling out both Democrats and Republicans for failing to address budget deficits quickly, using spending cuts and tax increases.Democrats need to accept cuts to entitlement programs like Social Security and Medicare, Stockman wrote in a recent New York Times op-ed, while Republicans should accept tax increases, not only for the rich, but also for the middle class. Stockman appeared on the roundtable This Week with Christiane Amanpour on May 1 to make similar arguments.Prior to the roundtable, Amanpour interviewed Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wisc. As the chair of the House Budget Committee, he created a broad budget proposal that the U.S. House of Representatives approved, mostly along party lines, on April 15. It's unlikely the proposal will become law; Senate Democrats and President Barack Obama oppose the plan.Stockman didn't have kind words for Ryan's outline.I think both parties are delusional in thinking that this is a long-run problem. The Ryan plan gets the balanced budget in 2030, the fiscal hereafter. We have a here-and-now problem, Stockman said. Now, what does Ryan do in the next two or three years? Nothing. He cuts $600 (billion) or $700 billion of spending, mostly from a small part of the budget, discretionary and the safety net, leaves Medicare totally untouched for three years, leaves Social Security totally untouched for 10 years, leaves defense totally untouched for the next three years, and then, after cutting that small amount, gives it all back by extending all the Bush tax cuts that we can't afford. ... In three years, he does not cut one dime from the debt. Ryan's budget proposal accepts cuts already proposed by Secretary of Defense Robert Gates but doesn't suggest additional reductions. Ryan's budget proposal uses the same numbers for defense spending as the White House's proposed 2012 budget, though Obama has since suggested additional cuts to defense. The reductions amount to $78 billion over the next five years, a small number considering defense got approximately $720 billion in 2011 alone. Ryan's budget slows the future growth of defense spending, but he doesn't actually reduce it.Ryan's proposal says explicitly that the first job of government is national defense and rejects deep, across-the-board cuts in funding for national defense. (On this point, Ryan's proposal has attracted critics both for proposing too much and too little. A commentator with the libertarian Cato Institute says defense should be cut more, while one from the conservative Heritage Foundation says the spending isn't enough to achieve U.S. security goals.)We checked the proposal's numbers with Todd Harrison, an expert on the defense budget at the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments, a research institute that focuses on defense. Even with Gates' suggested reduction, the Department of Defense budget would not actually go down -- it would essentially stay flat (only growing with inflation) for the next 12 years, Harrison said via e-mail.In three years, Ryan does not cut one dime from the debt.As Stockman noted in his comments, Ryan's proposal does cut some discretionary spending in the short term. But it's not enough to make a dent in the public debt. Keep in mind what the debt is: It's the total of all the money we've borrowed. The deficit, on the other hand, is the yearly shortfall. So making the deficit smaller each year doesn't cut the debt. As long as annual deficits exist, the debt will grow every year.Ryan's proposal reduces deficits but it does not eliminate them until 2040, 29 years from now, according to the CBO analysis. The Path to Prosperity document includes projections for the public debt between 2011 and 2021, and it shows debt going up every single year. Congress is now debating an increase in the debt limit from its current level of $14.3 trillion; Ryan's budget shows the debt increasing to $16.2 trillion in 2012 and rising every year after that up to $23.1 trillion in 2021.So Stockman's right on this one, too. True.Other viewpointsWe checked with Ryan's office for a response to Stockman's complaints. A spokesperson describes Ryan's plan as common sense gradual reforms, and pointed out that it reduces deficits compared with current policy and compared with President Obama's budget.Economic growth, combined with a real solution to rising health care costs, is the key to putting our budget on a path to balance and our economy on a path to prosperity. Tax increases kill growth, and simply cutting benefits for current seniors is not a real solution to rising health care costs, said spokesperson Conor Sweeney via e-mail.Meanwhile, we should point out that liberal critics who dislike Ryan's plan would also disagree with Stockman's critique. Short-term spending should not be reined in because it would hurt the economic recovery, they've said.Here's how New York Times columnist Paul Krugman put it recently: Why not slash deficits immediately? Because tax increases and cuts in government spending would depress economies further, worsening unemployment. And cutting spending in a deeply depressed economy is largely self-defeating even in purely fiscal terms: any savings achieved at the front end are partly offset by lower revenue, as the economy shrinks.Our rulingWhether the deficit should be reduced quickly or slowly is no doubt a debate that will continue to burn. Stockman urges a dramatic approach to cutting spending and increasing taxes quickly, while Ryan's proposal offers a more gradual approach to cutting spending, and it doesn't advocate raising taxes. Stockman said Ryan's plan leaves Medicare totally untouched for three years, leaves Social Security totally untouched for 10 years, leaves defense totally untouched for the next three years, and then, after cutting that small amount, gives it all back by extending all the Bush tax cuts that we can't afford. ... In three years, he does not cut one dime from the debt.",1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,true

Final Rating: True  ","Wisconsins 2019-21 budget produced the first positive general fund balance since 2000, and the governors proposed 2021-23 budget would return it to a deficit.","Wisconsins state government is diving into another battle over how its budget will look for the upcoming two-year period. In February, Gov. Tony Evers, a Democrat, proposed a $91 billion spending plan for 2021-23, seeking to expand Medicaid, roll back Act 10-era collective bargaining limits, legalize marijuana and raise the minimum wage -- among scores of other items intended to put the state back on its feet after the coronavirus pandemic. On May 6, 2021, the Republican-controlled Joint Finance Committee stripped nearly 400 items from Evers budget, with the co-chairs saying it included a tremendous amount of excessive spending, pet projects, tax increases and divisive non-fiscal policy. Democrats say Evers budget would fix long-standing problems in the state and honor measures that are widely popular with voters. But Republicans say their plan would keep Wisconsinites from facing a higher tax burden. Theyve also argued that the governors budget would send the states general fund back into a deficit based on a common accounting standard, after its 2019-21 budget created the first positive balance by that standard that the general fund had seen since 2000. Staff of Sen. Howard Marklein, R-Spring Green, created a chart showing as much that several members of the Republican caucus have shared on social media. Is the claim correct? Lets dig in. The chart cited depicts Wisconsins general fund deficit dating back to 2000, at which time the deficit totaled around $1 billion based on Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, or GAAP. The line peaks in fiscal year 2010-11, when the general fund deficit was nearly $3 billion, by this measure. In 2020, the chart shows a negative deficit — or rather, a positive general fund balance. An arrow then indicates that Evers proposed 2021-23 budget would return the general fund to a deficit. Gov. Evers budget is a bounce back to larger GAAP deficits, Sen. Duey Stroebel, R-Saukville, tweeted along with the chart on April 7, 2021. Adam Gibbs, communications director for the office of Senate Majority Leader Devin LeMahieu, R-Oostburg, provided an analysis from the nonpartisan Legislative Fiscal Bureau that bears some of the claim out. The analysis, which Marklein requested in December 2019, indeed shows the states general fund had been in deficit since 2000, with the largest — $2.99 billion — during fiscal year 2010-11. It ends with fiscal year 2017-18, at a $1.25 billion deficit. The general fund deficit for the following year is detailed in Wisconsins Comprehensive Annual Financial Report. In 2019, it was just under $800 million in deficit. In 2020, the tide turned and the general fund reached $1.5 million under those standard accounting principles, according to the Comprehensive Annual Financial Report for the fiscal year ending June 30. At the time, Evers credited his government for working on issues important to Wisconsinites without running up the states credit card. It was the first time Wisconsin had reached a positive GAAP fund balance since the state began issuing the comprehensive annual financial reports, he said. Evers 2021-23 budget in brief, released in February 2021, outlines a return to the general fund deficit over the next two years. In 2021, the estimated closing GAAP fund balance is still positive, at about $921 million. In 2022, its estimated at a deficit of nearly $2 million. In 2023, the estimated deficit is about $938 million. This deficit doesnt mean the states budget isnt balanced — in fact, Wisconsin is required by law to pass a balanced budget where estimated revenues are at least equal to estimated expenditures. The GAAP system, however, counts future expenditures at the time that the state commits to spending on them, even if they wont be paid until the next budget cycle. The states other method of accounting, called cash modified accrual, doesnt count expenditures until it comes time to pay them. Members of the states Republican caucus claim that Evers proposed budget would return the state to a GAAP fund deficit, after its first positive balance in the fund in decades in the biennium prior. The Legislative Fiscal Bureau analysis shows the funds deficit through fiscal year 2018, and the states annual financial report shows it turning around in 2020. In the Department of Administrations estimation of the next two years, the deficit would return in 2022 and persist through 2023.  ",1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,true

Final Rating: True  ","Contends that President Obama literally said (if) his cap-and-trade proposals were to pass, that utility rates, his words now, would, 'necessarily skyrocket.'","With Congress debating a cap-and-trade plan to reduce global warming, House Republicans are touting an alternative that they say will be less expensive.Instead of regulating carbon dioxide by forcing power companies to buy and trade polluting credits, why not subsidize renewable fuel production and build new nuclear reactors, posited GOP Congressman Mike Pence on MSNBC's  Morning Joe  on June 10, 2009. Otherwise, he said, power companies will pass the cost of buying those credits on to the consumer, driving up the price of energy.Pence wanted to make clear that he was not taking credit for that economic prediction.I don't think you need to look any further than the president himself ... who literally said [if] his cap-and-trade proposals were to pass, that utility rates, his words now, would, 'necessarily skyrocket,' said Pence. He added that Democrat John Dingle of Michigan and the Commerce Committee said people don't realize this is a tax, and a 'great big one.'It didn't take us long to find Barack Obama's original quote, which came from a videotaped interview he did with the  San Francisco Chronicle  editorial board very early in the presidential campaign, January 2008.Under my plan of a cap-and-trade system, electricity rates would necessarily skyrocket, Obama told the  Chronicle  . Coal-powered plants, you know, natural gas, you name it, whatever the plants were, whatever the industry was, they would have to retrofit their operations. That will cost money. They will pass that money on to consumers.While Obama was talking specifically about cap-and-trade, he was also making a larger point that the biggest challenge will be making sure voters understand why such a plan is necessary.The problem is can you get the American people to say this is really important, Obama said.So, Pence is right. Obama did say that cap-and-trade would be costly to power plants and to consumers.What's fuzzy, however, is  how  costly. PolitiFact has already  looked into the issue  and found that estimates vary. Republicans say each household will pay $3,100 a year, a figure they came up with based upon a Massachusetts Institute of Technology study that predicted a cap-and-trade proposal would generate $366 billion annually. On March 24, 2009, we gave the claim a Pants on Fire ruling because the GOP's calculation was badly flawed and because the GOP used the figure even though the author of the MIT study had told them it was wrong. And in an April 1 letter to House Republicans, authors of the MIT study said that the report was being misinterpreted; by their count, estimates hover closer to $340 per family.Congress has its own estimate: A 15 percent cut in carbon emissions would cost the average household about $1,600, according to a March 12, 2009, Congressional Budget Office testimony.It is worth noting that the climate debate has changed substantially since Obama sat down with the  Chronicle  nearly a year and a half ago. Legislators have opted to give 85 percent of the polluting permits away for free instead of putting them up for sale, as Obama pledged to do on the campaign trail. In theory, this approach should reduce costs to consumers. Furthermore, revenue from auctioned permits will help consumers pay for increased energy prices, according to Obama's first budget.Despite those potential cost cuts, there's still little disagreement that consumers will pay for cap-and-trade, whether it's $3,100 a year or $340. Because that hasn't changed since Obama first said that utility rates would necessarily skyrocket, and because Pence got Obama's words just right, we give Pence a True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/6ffafdf4-5637-4e52-8ff3-7d5f0ecab7f6",1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,true

Final Rating: True  ","Financial conflict-of-interest laws don't apply to the president, right? So, the president doesn't have to have a blind trust.","How President-elect Donald Trump will handle his extensive businesses and financial holdings — and the potential conflict of interest that comes with them — when he gets into the Oval Office remains an open question. Trump has said his children will manage his business dealings. Many presidents in the past have put their assets in a blind trust, which is when an independent trustee manages another persons assets without the persons input. But Trump doesnt actually have to do any of this because the financial conflict-of-interest laws dont apply to him as president, said former New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, who is reportedly on the short list for a seat on Trumps cabinet. Well, first of all, you realize that those laws don't apply to the president, right? Giuliani told CNNs Jake Tapper Nov. 13. So, the president doesn't have to have a blind trust. For some reason, when the law was written, the president was exempt. Giuliani has the law pretty much right. Trump, as president, has no legal obligation to detach himself from his businesses and financial interests. The law at issue is Title 18 Section 208 of the U.S. code. It says federal executive branch employees cant participate in government matters in which they or their immediate family has a financial interest. Because of this law, some federal employees put their investments in a blind trust. This allows them to sidestep the regulation and participate in a matter that might otherwise pose a conflict of interest. But the president and the vice president, despite being executive branch employees, are exempt. According to the laws definitions, Title 18 Section 208 does not apply to them, nor does it apply to members of Congress or federal judges. It appears that presidents have mostly escaped the normal web of ethics and conflict-of-interest laws, said Scott Amey, general counsel at the Project on Government Oversight, a nonpartisan government accountability watchdog. Amey added that presidents are allowed to accept gifts in many cases, too. Its been this way since at least 1974, when the Justice Department issued a letter saying Title 18 Section 208 did not apply to the president. Congress expressly codified the exemptions in 1989. In the 1974 letter, the Justice Department said the legislative history of this conflict-of-interest provision indicated that it was never intended to apply to the president. Additionally, the Justice Department said placing conflict-of-interest laws on the president could constrain him in a potentially unconstitutional manner, though it did not give specific examples. As the head of the executive branch, the president may not be able to — and arguably under the Constitution it might not be possible to require the president to — recuse from government decisions, said Richard Briffault, a professor of legislation at Columbia Law School. While Title 18 Section 208 is the primary conflict-of-interest provision, there are other relevant rules, including a couple that dont exempt the president. Trump and Vice President Mike Pence will have to disclose their finances, which is required of all high-level federal employees, Briffault said. But the disclosures are not as detailed as federal tax returns, which Trump has not released. Then theres the Constitutions Emoluments Clause, which bans U.S. government employees from accepting presents or compensation from foreign governments, noted Kathleen Clark, an expert on legal ethics and a law professor at Washington University in St. Louis. The Trump Organization has numerous foreign ties, including several overseas real estate deals with possible foreign government connections. In 2012, for example, Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan attended a ribbon cutting ceremony for Trump Towers Mall in Istanbul. If any of Trumps business arrangements involve the receipt of payments from foreign governments, I believe that he, or his entities from which he receives money, would have to forgo those payments, or he would have to detach from those entities, Clark said. But it's not fully clear that presidents arebound by the Emoluments Clause, and no court has weighed into answer this question. The way the clause is constructred — that itdoesn't specify the president,unlike other provisions inthe Constitution, for example— and the fact that President George Washington himself took gifts from the French government without asking Congress for permission, together make a good case that it doesn't apply to presidents,said Seth Barrett Tillman, a professor at Maynooth University in Ireland who has studied the clause. Our ruling Giuliani said financial conflict-of-interest laws don't apply to the president, right? So, the president doesn't have to have a blind trust. The president is, in fact, exempt from the primary conflict-of-interest provision in the U.S. code. So presidents do not have any legal obligation to put their financial holdings in a blind trust or to detach themselves from their financial interests in any way. As president, Trump will have to comply with financial disclosure requirements, however, and it's possible he is constrained by a clause in the Constitution regarding income from foreign governments.

Final Rating: True  ","We, the bishops of the United States -- can you believe it -- in 1919 came out for more affordable, more comprehensive, more universal health care.","The Catholic church and the White House have been clashing over contraception requirements in President Barack Obamas signature health care law. As weve noted before, the Affordable Care Act requires Catholic hospitals to provide all birth control approved by the Food and Drug Administration to their employers with no out-of-pocket costs, including birth control pills, Plan B, diaphragms and hormone shots. Coverage for emergency contraception, but not abortion, is required. Religious employers are exempt from the requirement, but the hospitals dont qualify for exemptions because they both employ and serve people who may not share their religious beliefs. In an interview with David Gregory on NBCs Meet the Press, Cardinal Timothy Dolan of New York, perhaps the most prominent member of the Catholic heirarchy in the United States, spoke out against a mandate for hospitals to provide these services, including emergency-contraception pills. At the same time, though, Dolan cited some common ground between the church and the administration its been battling. We bishops have been really kind of in a tough place because we're for universal, comprehensive, life-affirming health care, Dolan said. We, the bishops of the United States -- can you believe it -- in 1919 came out for more affordable, more comprehensive, more universal health care. That's how far back we go in this battle, okay? We wondered whether the bishops support for comprehensive health care really goes back nearly a century. Experts pointed us to the history of the National Catholic Welfare Council, the predecessor of the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops. The council held an annual meeting in which U.S. bishops discussed national policy issues such as education, welfare and health care. During the February 1919, meeting, held just after World War I, a group of bishops, led by a Catholic social reformer, Father John A. Ryan, published the Bishops Program of Social Reconstruction, a guide to overhauling U.S. social justice. Dolan was referring to a section on social insurance, his spokesman said. The state, the guide read, should make comprehensive provision for insurance against illness, invalidity, unemployment, and old age. That wasnt the last time the USCCB has supported health care expansions. For example, the group has publicly supported a variety of proposals, including former President Bill Clintons ultimately defeated health care plan in 1993. The flap is over the (contraception) issue, said Maria Mazzenga, a Catholic history archivist at The Catholic University of America. Thats where it comes to appear that theyre against universal health care. Mazzenga said that, despite opposition to one specific part of Obamacare, all but the most conservative bishops have consistently supported health care efforts over the years. Our ruling Dolan said U.S. bishops have supported expanding health care since 1919. Hes correct that the National Catholic Welfare Council published pro-health-care expansion literature that year, and experts told us that the bishops have regularly supported proposals to expand health care over the years, despite disagreements over specific provisions enacted under Obama, including contraception regulations.",1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.5,1.0,1.0,true

Final Rating: True  ",The National Park Service has an annual budget that is less than the city of Austin.,"From the mountains to the valleys and to the oceans, the U.S. government spends less money running parks than Austin devotes to city government, a federal honcho told Congress. Jonathan Jarvis, director of the National Park Service, prefaced his June 14, 2016, mention of Austin with some agency self-celebration, telling the U.S. House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform: The NPS manages many of our nations most iconic and beloved landscapes and historic sites. We are responsible for managing more than 400 individual parks with more than 84 million acres of land, stretching from Acadia National Park in the State of Maine to the National Park of American Samoa in the South Pacific. The NPS also manages numerous wild and scenic rivers and national trails; programs that recognize our nations historic structures; and programs that help local governments and organizations provide recreational opportunities and protect open space. We are seeing record-breaking visitation -- more than 300 million last year -- and the resulting economic activity created by the parks topped $16 billion. We are accomplishing all of this, Jarvis said next, on an annual budget that is less than the city of Austin, Texas. Right off, Jarvis seemed right on the numbers. For the fiscal year that began Oct. 1, 2015, the park services budget amounts to $3.4 billion, which folds in $2.85 billion appropriated by Congress plus expected fee revenue, a park service spokesman, Jeff Olson, advised by email. The service has 22,000 employees, he said. Olson, asked how Jarvis came to single out Austin, said that in preparing for the House hearing, Jarvis was looking for another government entity's budget with which to compare the NPS. Jarvis settled on Austin for his comparison after looking online for the budgets of various cities, Olson said. For the same fiscal year, the Austin City Council approved a $3.5 billion budget, according to the published city budget. A city spokesman, David Green, conceded the numerical differences though he indicated that comparing the total budgets obscures vast differences between the federal agency and Austin city government. While it is accurate to say Austins $3.5 billion budget is larger than that of the National Park Service, Green said by email, it is difficult to make a direct comparison. The City of Austin has over 13,000 employees spread across more than 40 departments – including our own Water and Electric utilities – that provide daily direct service to more than 900,000 residents. The scope and mission of the city is simply too varied to make an apples-to-apples comparison, Green said. Olson, reacting to Greens analysis, said by email: It may be difficult to compare Austin to the NPS. While the city serves 900,000 residents, the NPS serves more than 300 million visitors each year, many of them from Austin, no doubt. A federal wrinkle? We asked a pro-parks group, the National Parks Conservation Association, about Jarvis claim. By email, spokeswoman Kati Schmidt said association experts pegged the services fiscal 2016 budget at $3.377 billion after adding appropriated funds plus fees and other mandatory funding. But Schmidt also illuminated additional money coming to the park service for federal road projects. Park service roads also benefit from Highway Trust Fund dollars for maintenance totaling $268 million this year, Schmidt wrote. That $268 million would drive up the agencys total expected 2016 spending to $3.645 billion by our calculation--which would exceed Austin city governments $3.5 billion budget. But hold on: We ran this thought past the park services Olson who said by phone its fair to say the additional roads money is being spent by the agency. Yet Olson said by email the $268 million is part of the U.S. Department of Transportation budget. The associations Schmidt further told us the park services resources/facilities also benefit at times from a variety of other random smaller sources like state grants and private donations (both monetary and in-kind), but we dont have any sum total of all funding sources that benefit the system. These other sources are not technically part of the NPS budget so in terms of Jarvis reference to an annual budget, indeed the claim appears to be defensible, Schmidt said. Citing insufficient knowledge about the citys budget, Schmidt declined to speculate about whether the director made a fair apples-to-apples comparison. Some differences beyond budget totals Its worth noting the park service and Austins city government draw on divergent revenue sources. Congress, which spends tax revenue, appropriated 84 percent of the park services budget. In contrast, just 24 percent of the citys 2015-16 budget, or $818 million, was penciled in to come from tax revenue. On the other hand, the city budget shows $1.9 billion in revenue from utility charges, largely meaning income from the sale of electricity, water and wastewater services; that chunk of money covers 54 percent of the city budget. Notably, too, the city has a capital improvements budget supported by debt, grants and fund transfers. In 2015-16, the Austin City Council appropriated $629.6 million for such projects; that amount is not part of the $3.5 billion total budget, city spokeswoman Alicia Dean told us by phone. So, the city plans to spend more than $4 billion in fiscal 2016, counting the regular and capital improvements budgets. Olson told us the park services 2016 budget folds in more than $192 million budgeted by the agency for comparable construction and repair/rehabilitation purposes. Put another way, he said, that money is part of the $3.4 billion total budget. Our ruling Jarvis said the National Park Service has an annual budget that is less than the budget for the city of Austin. For the fiscal year through September 2016, this is so by $100 million--though there are arguably plenty of differences between the agency and Austin city government that keep this comparison from meaning a great deal.

Final Rating: True",Says the media distortedwhat happened with a baby at his rally.,"Donald Trump is crying foul at news reports alleging he kicked a crying baby out of a Virginia rally last week. The media is going crazy. They totally distort so many things on purpose. Crimea, nuclear, the baby and so much more. Very dishonest! he tweeted. We looked into his widelyreported comments on Crimea and a host of other issues. But is it true that babygate isnt based on reality? Trumps charge of media distortion sticks. The scandal started at an Aug. 2 Trump rally in Ashburn, Va. As he was talking about trade, a baby began to cry in the audience, prompting the famously off-the-cuff Trump to chime in. I love babies. I hear that baby cry, I like it, he said. What a baby. What a beautiful baby. Don't worry, don't worry. The mom's running around, like, don't worry about it, you know. It's young and beautiful and healthy, and that's what we want. As the baby continued to cry, Trump continued to comment. Actually I was only kidding, you can get the baby out of here, he said. I think she really believed me that I love having a baby crying while I'm speaking. That's okay. People don't understand. That's okay. These sentences caught fire in the press. Heres a smattering of headlines from a variety of media outlets: • New York Daily News: SEE IT: Donald Trump kicks crying baby out of rally • Rolling Stone: Watch Donald Trump Throw Crying Baby Out of Rally • New York Times: Donald Trump Jousts With a Crying Baby at His Rally • Fox News: Trump has infant removed from rally for making noise • Salon:  You can get that baby out of here: Donald Trump, upstaged by crying baby, orders it removed from rally • Wired: Trump didnt just banish a baby. He banished a mother • Baltimore Sun: Trump banished the baby, humiliated the mother But, as our friends at the Washington Post Fact Checker reported, Trump didnt actually kick the baby out of his rally.  Toronto Star reporter Daniel Dale cleared things up that day, writing that Trumps get the baby out of here comment came as the mother was already exiting. A joke? Possibly. An insensitive, heartless, ordinary-person-embarrassing remark? Possibly. Trumps tone is eternally hard to read, Dale wrote. But, to my eyes, it certainly was not an ejection — it was an unusually barbed endorsement of the mothers own decision to depart. NBC reporter Katy Tur was also at the event and said comment was very clearly a joke and the baby stayed. Tur reported about the incident on Bloombergs With All Due Respect (around the 30 minute mark). Another guest on the program, the Washington Posts Phil Rucker, agreed: I was there, too. It was a joke. It was definitely a joke. The Associated Press reported that after saying you can get that baby out of here, Trump then seemed to suggest that he was joking and the baby could stay. The child soon stopped crying. Devan Ebert, the mother herself, said as much in widely circulated Facebook posts soon after the news reports began appearing. Ebert confirmed to PolitiFact that this statement came from her: I excused myself and my child when he awoke from his nap and began to cry. It was only because I had to grab my child's belongings and then make my way out of the aisle I was seated in that I wasn't out of there sooner. ... I fully support Mr. Trump. I thought he responded very graciously to my child crying and he made a lighthearted moment out of what I usually consider to be stressful. I actually was out of the auditorium before he even made his follow up comment about my child and even then, when I was informed of his comment. I laughed. I understand he says things jokingly, and I understand no one wants to speak over or struggle to listen over a crying baby. I am in no way offended and I again reiterate, Mr. Trump NEVER kicked me or my child out of the Briar Woods High School, Trump rally. Ebert reiterated this in an interview, telling us she was never kicked out of the rally and Trump still has her vote. I appreciate that Mr. Trump made light of an otherwise stressful situation, she said. At the time of this report, none of the publications listed above have issued corrections or updated their stories. Our ruling Trump said the media distortedwhat happened with a baby at his rally. Many media outlets reported that Trump threw out or ejected a crying baby from a campaign event in Virginia, based on his commentary on the incident. But this isnt true. Trumps comments came as the mother was already voluntarily exiting from the rally. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/598870c7-2bbd-47a5-8d22-04f0a67ebc97",1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,true

Final Rating: True","Today, for the first time in fifteen years, Master Locks unionized plant in Milwaukee is running at full capacity.","President Barack Obama hailed the return of manufacturing jobs that had been shipped overseas during his State of the Union speech on Jan. 24, 2012. The president discussed companies that have brought back production after labor problems in China, economic issues and higher shipping rates added to costs.Obama said: We cant bring every job back thats left our shore. But right now, its getting more expensive to do business in places like China. Meanwhile, America is more productive.He added: A few weeks ago, the CEO of Master Lock told me that it now makes business sense for him to bring jobs back home. Today, for the first time in 15 years, Master Locks unionized plant in Milwaukee is running at full capacity.Master Lock hasnt had this much publicity since it ran those Tough Under Fire Super Bowl ads showing their product surviving a sharpshooters bullet. Those ads ran for 20 years, starting in the mid-1970s.So whats the latest at the companys huge central city plant?The lock maker, a division of Fortune Brands Home & Security, Inc., was founded in Milwaukee in 1921.Fifteen years ago, Master Lock had about 1,154 workers at its Milwaukee plant, 2600 N. 32nd Street, a sprawling facility thats been described as the size of seven football fields. That year, Master Lock announced that it would begin importing locks from China, a move that began a string of large job reductions in Milwaukee.Two years later, the company announced that it would open a lock assembly factory in Nogales, Mexico. Because of the outsourcing and competition from those cheaper locks made elsewhere, employment in the Milwaukee plant fell to about 270 employees in 2003, the company said.The cost advantages of overseas production began to decline in the late 2000s. By the end of 2010, the company said, several dozen jobs were moved back to Milwaukee. Employment grew to 379, news reports said.In early 2011, company executives used the full capacity description of production in a Journal Sentinel story about the return of the outsourced jobs. That message returned at a White House meeting in January 2012, and again in the State of the Union address.The White House meeting was a in-sourcing forum. At that event, the president singled out Master Lock for praise.The company says employment in Milwaukee is now 412. Master Lock still operates factories in China and Mexico.So what does it mean when the company and Obama say that the plant is operating at full capacity? After all, there are nearly 750 fewer people working there than 15 years ago.Without providing specifics or revenue figures, Master Lock said in a written statement that the Milwaukee plant is a far different operation than it was in 1997.The Milwaukee plant is producing parts and components at a much higher volume than in 1997, reflecting our regained market share and Master Lock's overall revenue growth, which is approximately double 1997 revenues, the company said. Moreover, Milwaukee-made production is now being sold directly to Master Lock customers in China, reflecting its new competitiveness. Master Lock said it decided to re-size and convert Milwaukee into a more automated and highly efficient manufacturer of parts and components regardless of final assembly destination.Such lean manufacturing efforts have paid off for many companies, said Nick Hayes, a partner with FiveTwelve Group Ltd., a business research and consulting firm in Milwaukee.Manufacturers can become far more efficient by using automation, high-tech equipment and streamlining the way they move supplies and inventory around a factory, he said.Hayes offered an example of a factory he worked with that adopted lean manufacturing. The company downsized from a 60,000 square foot factory and 100 workers to one that was two-thirds smaller, with half the work force. Production increased 10-fold.The question I would have for Master Lock is how primitive were they before? Hayes said.Consumer demand for the product is another critical factor, he said. And Master Lock indicated that sales had increased.Without providing specifics, Master Lock said it hoped to continue to add jobs in Milwaukee.We plan to invest in the plant this year to add capacity as we in-source more work. We are also investing in training and working with area technical colleges and universities to find and equip skilled workers.Our conclusionObama singled out Master Lock saying the company brought back outsourced jobs and is operating at capacity for the first time in 15 years. Thats the same thing Master Lock executives said more than a year ago, and theyve continued to add jobs and said they would continue to do so. It also tracks with their efforts to attract a more highly skilled work force to run an updated operation.",1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,true

Final Rating: True  ",The number of inmates since 2000 on death row dying of natural causes has now surpassed the number of inmates executed.,"House Speaker Dean Cannon thinks the Florida court system overstepped its authority last year when it removed three Constitutional amendment questions from the statewide ballot. So, in 2011, he's talking about comprehensive court reform.Addressing a group of nearly 50 reporters and editors at the annual pre-session meeting organized by the Associated Press, Cannon again made his case that the court system should not have removed constitutional amendments that, if approved by voters, would have granted tax breaks for first-time home buyers and affected state redistricting. A third amendment was drafted in response to the new federal health care law to prohibit Florida from participating in any health insurance exchange that compels people to buy insurance.All three amendments were stripped from the ballot after judges ruled that the attached ballot language was either flawed or misleading.Cannon said he will propose legislative changes to effectively remove or diminish judicial review of ballot questions.But that's not all.Florida's judicial system has the authority to take away not only a person's liberty, but also a person's life. Understanding the severity and irreversible nature of that penalty, we have a responsibility to ensure that justice is administered not only fairly, but also efficiently, Cannon said. Criminal cases are complex in nature and in recent years we've seen cases overturned, and there have been errors. The number of inmates since 2000 on death row dying of natural causes has now surpassed the number of inmates executed. Significant and unreasonable delays plague the current process of conducting state post-conviction review in these cases and it appears that there is little the Supreme Court can do to improve or streamline the process.Cannon said that is where the Legislature can step in.I believe the Legislature can and should work with the judicial branch to significantly improve the administration of justice in death penalty cases, he said. I am hopeful that reform could lead to a more equitable judicial system for all Floridians, and as we move forward toward the 2011 legislative session, we will continue to explore this issue to determine when and what the right course of action for Florida may be.Cannon hasn't specified what court reform legislation might look like, though by his comments it sure sounds like he wants the appeals process in death row cases hastened. In that vein, we decided to check his facts about Florida's death row, focusing on this claim: The number of inmates since 2000 on death row dying of natural causes has now surpassed the number of inmates executed.Of the 392 people now on Florida's death row,House records indicate that145 inmateshave been there for 20 years or longer and 34have been there for 30 years or more, according to Cannon spokeswoman Katie Betta.Gary Alvord has been on Florida's death row since April 1974, according to the Florida Department of Corrections. Alvord escaped a Michigan mental hospital and wound up in Tampa, where he killed three women. Alvord, who turned 64 on Jan. 10, 2011, has been on death row for more than 13,400 days. This April, he will have been awaiting execution for37 years.John Vining, who was sentenced to death in 1990, is the oldest person on death row. On March 13, 2011, he will turn 80.Vining wasconvicted of shooting and killing a woman who was trying to sell him a $60,000 diamond.Since Florida reinstated the death penalty in 1976 (and began carrying out sentences in 1979), 69 people have been executed -- a rate of a little over two per year. One reason, for starters,is a lengthy and costly appeals process. But politics plays a role as well. The governor must sign a death warrant for an execution to proceed.And sometimesother complicating factors are cited.Alvord, for instance, has a long history of mental illness and has been declared mentally incompetent by several courts.The last person to be executed in Florida was Martin Grossman in February 2010. Grossman was convicted of shooting a Pinellas County wildlife officer who happened upon Grossman shooting a stolen handgun in a wooded area.Gov. Charlie Crist signed the death warrant of David Eugene Johnston in 2010 as well, but Johnston died while awaiting his sentence. He was convicted of stabbing an 84-year-old Orlando woman to death in 1983.That transitions naturally to Cannon's claim.The Florida Department of Corrections provided PolitiFact Florida with a list of 55 inmates who died on death row starting Jan. 1, 2000. Thirty of the 55 somehow died while awaiting their sentence (the state does not describe the nature of a person's death), and 25 were executed.For example, Eddie Lee Sexton Sr. died on Dec. 29, 2010, while living on death row. Sexton was convicted of murder after a jury found that he ordered his mentally impaired son to strangle Sexton's son-in-law at a Florida park. Sexton feared that the son-in-law was going to report family abuses to local authorities, prosecutors said. Sexton was sentenced to death in 1998.Robert Power died on Dec. 3, 2010, while awaiting sentence for the rape and murder of a 12-year-old Orange County girl. Power had been on death row for 20 years. The waiting and appeals process certainly comes with additional cost. The Death Penalty Information Center, a Washington policy group that does not advocate for or against the death penalty, published a 2009 report discussing the cost of enforcing the death penalty. The group cited a 2000 Palm Beach Post analysis, which said that the state spends $51 million a year enforcing the death penalty. That's $51 million a year more than it would cost to punish all first-degree murderers with life in prison instead. The figure has been repeated by several other news publications as well as Rex Dimmig, chief assistant public defender of the 10th Judicial Circuit, in testimony before a state Senate committee discussing the death penalty.Make no mistake, the death penalty is a controversial and complex policy issue. But here, we're focusing on Cannon's call for reforms based on death row inmate data. He said: The number of inmates since 2000 on death row dying of natural causes has now surpassed the number of inmates executed. He's right. Of the 55 death row inmates to die since Jan. 1, 2000, only 25 actually were executed.",1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,true

Final Rating: True  ",Sherrod Brown has voted with Barack Obama 95 percent of the time.,"Republicans in Washington, D.C., and Ohio have vast ideological differences with U.S. Sen. Sherrod Brown, an Ohio Democrat.Brown says the government plays a positive role in peoples lives when it provides a safety net (new health insurance programs, financial regulation, help for cash-strapped cities and schools) while supporting the private sector. Republicans say the government needs to step back to propel the economic engine that is the private sector.While lofty, that makes for a poor sound bite. But the GOP knows this, and is prepared to frame its November election effort against Brown like this: When you look at his voting record, what's going to stick with voters is that he has voted with Barack Obama 95 percent of the time. He can talk about differences some of the time, but you've got to look at the record.That quote comes from Christopher Maloney, communications director for the Ohio Republican Party. Maloney made the claim to The Plain Dealer during a telephone interview in December 2011, and again with a slight variation on Jan. 22, 2012, that well discuss in a moment. It is that variation that we're checking here.The interview was for a story, published Jan. 23, on how Republicans plan to campaign against Brown in the coming political season. While the newspaper checked out the figure and had reason to believe it was accurate, it also believed -- for purposes of PolitiFact Ohio -- that the figure deserved further examination, and a ruling on the Truth-O-Meter. After all, voters are likely to hear the claim a lot this year.Maloney said his figure came from Congressional Quarterly, a nonpartisan journalism organization that reports on Capitol Hill lawmaking dispassionately. CQ, as it is known, serves as a bit of a bible for journalists, congressional offices and even lobbyists, because it goes into the weeds of legislating like few other publications do. Its reporting winds up in CQ Today, CQ Weekly, CQ online products, and an annual hard-bound political almanac, Politics in America.Besides covering hearings and more, CQ examines voting patterns for every member of Congress and sorts them in ways that allow comparisons. One of those ways is through an annual examination of presidential support, or the number and percentage of votes by each lawmaker on bills in which the sitting president has staked a position.So, for example, CQ counted a vote for the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, better known as the economic stimulus bill, as a vote in support of the president. The same principle applied to the health care reform vote of 2010, to votes on taxes, the debt ceiling, and so on. Presidents weigh in on fewer than half of all Senate votes (Obama had a position on 39 percent of the Senates 235 votes last year), and some bills have broad bipartisan support no matter who is in the White House.No lawmaker winds up with a presidential support score of zero -- not even such small-government fans as Republicans Jim DeMint of South Carolina or Rand Paul of Kentucky. But the closer to zero, or to 100, a score is, the higher the lawmakers opposition or support for the presidents agenda.Back to the figure Maloney cited: He stated from the start that his source was CQ. He originally said the figure for Brown was 97 percent -- that is, that Brown has voted with President Obama 97 percent of the time. That was based on an average of CQ ratings, for 2009 (Obamas first year, when Brown scored 96 percent) and 2010 (98 percent). Maloney was accurate when he made the statement because CQ Weekly had not yet published its ratings for 2011.That changed, just before The Plain Dealer was about to publish its story. A new issue of CQ Weekly came out, with new numbers covering 2011. And the positions of Brown and Obama, it turns out, diverged slightly more often in 2011 than in the previous two years.Browns presidential support rating dropped to 92 percent in 2011 -- matching, it turns out, the 92 percent support rate that other Democratic senators had on average for the president last year. In contrast, Browns Ohio colleague, Republican freshman Rob Portman, voted with the president 59.5 percent of the time in 2011 -- which while not as high as the 71.90 percent rate of Maine Republican Susan Collins, still put Portman in the top tier, at 13th, of Republicans voting most often for Obamas positions. DeMint and Paul, by contrast, each had presidential support ratings of 41 percent in 2011.When averaged for the three years of Obamas presidency so far, then, Browns support fell from 97 percent to 95 percent. (Do the math: 96 plus 98 plus 92, divided by 3, equals 95.3.) Maloney, when told by The Plain Dealer that CQ had had just put out brand new figures, updated his statement to reflect that 95 percent rate.We report this without judgment on whether it is good or bad to support the Obama agenda. Brown has disagreed with Obama on foreign trade and on some greenhouse gas-regulation issues. But Maloney says that youve got to look at the record.And the record -- compiled not by an opposition party but by a publication regarded as eminently impartial -- provides an average of 95 percent. The figure is current. On the Truth-O-Meter, Maloneys claim merits a rating of True.",1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,true

Final Rating: True  ","There is nothing in the current state public records law that prohibits sensitive or confidential business information from being just that, confidential.","New Gov. John Kasich has made it clear his top priority while in office is to bring jobs to Ohio and turn the economy around.JobsOhio, a publicly funded, private nonprofit corporation, is Kasichs big idea to attract businesses here and create jobs. The nonprofit corporation will act as a privatized version of the Department of Developments economic development efforts. Yet the transition of this public agency, which Kasich has described as sluggish and ineffective, to the private sector has raised concerns about transparency and accountability.Kasich, a Republican, wants JobsOhio to be exempt from Ohios public records and open meetings laws. The corporation would be audited annually to show the public its spending. But Democrats have loudly criticized the exemptions, saying they would keep the corporations operations under wraps and out of the public view, inviting scandal and a misuse of taxpayers dollars. Kasich and other Republicans say the exemptions are needed to help JobsOhio move at the speed of business. Public disclosure could disrupt business negotiations, they argue.State Rep. Matt Lundy, a Democrat from Elyria, is not convinced JobsOhio needs to be shielded from public records laws, and he has introduced legislation to subject the corporation to those rules.There is nothing in the current state public records law that prohibits sensitive or confidential business information from being just that, confidential, Lundy said in a Feb. 7 news release announcing his legislation, which he called the Taxpayers Right to Know Act.Republicans control the Ohio House of Representatives, so Lundys bill is unlikely to get much attention. But since his effort highlights ongoing concerns about JobsOhio, PolitiFact Ohio decided to check out Lundys claim and examine how Ohios public records laws treat the states interactions with outside businesses.Ohios public records law, section 149.43 of Ohio Revised Code, establishes the public availability of records kept by public offices, whether its a city hall or local school district or the governor. The law also includes numerous exceptions, which range from a police officers home address to adoption records.These exceptions also apply to certain business records.Sensitive business records often fall within the trade secrets exception to Ohios public records law, said David Marburger, an attorney for Baker Hostetler in Cleveland and counsel for the Ohio Coalition for Open Government. Marburger, who often represents The Plain Dealer on issues of public access to government, called the trade secrets exception extremely broad.Ohio Revised Code section 1333.61 defines a trade secret as any information, including business information, financial information, technical information, formulas, names addresses and telephone numbers, of actual or potential economic value.Marburger said the trade secret exception is a nearly impenetrable shield when a government entity and a business share sensitive or confidential information.Kent State University School of Journalism and Mass Communication professor Tim Smith agreed. He also cited the trade secrets exception when asked about Lundys statement. From my knowledge about the open records law, Lundys statement is accurate, said Smith, a former managing editor for the Akron Beacon Journal.Kasichs administration and Republicans in the House of Representatives, which already has approved the JobsOhio plan, have offered a cross-section of scenarios in which public disclosure would impede JobsOhios mission. (The Republican-controlled Ohio Senate is still reviewing the plan.) For example, if communication between JobsOhio and a sought-after company was public record, another states could use that information to trump Ohios offer.PolitiFact Ohio is not rating whether JobsOhio should be exempted from public records laws. Regardless of the advantages or disadvantages, Lundys statement that Ohios public records law includes exceptions that protect sensitive and confidential business information is correct.On the Truth-O-Meter it earns a rating of True.",1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,true

Final Rating: True  ",There are countries in Africa where they have higher vaccination rates than here in the United States.,"Sunday show talking heads continued to debate vaccinations of children -- specifically, how there should be no debate -- as they analyzed political missteps from the past week. BBC World News America anchor Katherine Katty Kay made a startling comparison to highlight how Americans have been less diligent in making sure their children are properly immunized. There are countries in Africa where they have higher vaccination rates than here in the United States, Kay said on NBCs Meet the Press. Because when people really need it,and they see the effects that measles can have on their communities, they will make sure that their children vaccinate. Rhetoric about the measles outbreak stemming from Disneyland in California, home to a significant measles-resistant population, is keeping PunditFactand PolitiFactbusy. We wanted to continue our look at this re-emerging viral threat by examining the accuracy of Kays claim. While we did not hear back from her by our deadline, we have a pretty good idea of Kays source. The World Health Organization, which recommends infants be vaccinated with at least one dose of the MMR vaccine before their first birthday, maintains immunization rates for the measles vaccine among 1-year-olds by country. The most recent data is for 2013. There were 16 African countries that beat the U.S. rate of 91 percentfor the measles-mumps-rubella vaccinein 2013, according to the WHO data. (TheCenters for Disease Control and Prevention putsthe measles immunization rate in the United States is91.9 percent.But the WHO and CDC measure the statistic in different ways, and as you'll see, it doesn't make a difference.) The countries besting the United States are Algeria, Botswana, Burundi, Egypt, Eritrea, Gambia, Kenya, Lesotho, Libya, Mauritius, Morocco, Rwanda, Seychelles, Tanzania, Tunisia and Zimbabwe. United States  91 percent * Algeria 95 percent Botswana 94 percent Burundi 98 percent Egypt 96 percent Eritrea 96 percent Gambia 96 percent Kenya 93 percent Lesotho 92 percent Libya 98 percent Mauritius 99 percent Morocco 99 percent Rwanda 97 percent Seychelles 97 percent Tanzania 99 percent Tunisia 94 percent Zimbabwe 93 percent  Of course, many African countries facing steep impoverished conditions have lower and substantially lower rates, such as Central African Republic (25 percent), Chad (59 percent), Equatorial Guinea (42 percent), Ethiopia (62 percent), Nigeria (59 percent), South Sudan (30 percent) and South Africa (66 percent). More broadly, its not just African countries beating the United States. Latin American countries with rates about the same as or exceeding the United States include El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras and Mexico. South Africa-based think tank Good Governance Africa spurred news about the United States trailing some African countries in a Feb. 5 press release highlighting the WHO data. Researcher Kate van Niekerk hailed the improved availability and widespread usage of the vaccine as a major public health success that has reduced child deaths even though the disease continues to kill about 400 children every day. Still, Dr. Cathy Troisi, infectious disease epidemiologist at the University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston School of Public Health, said the nearly universal use of the measles vaccine in some parts of Africa is the result of a large international effort to reduce child mortality. Reducing by two-thirds the under-five mortality rate between 1990 and 2015 was one target of the United Nations millenium goals. Unlike in some regions of Africa, where measles remains a leading cause of child death, some American parents are strangers to scary, eradicated diseases that afflicted prior generations, she said. Americans also generally value individual rights over community needs, she added. Im old enough that I was born before the polio vaccine became available, Troisi said, and you can bet when it came out, my mom was first in line to get me vaccinated. Part of the reason were seeing this refusal is because parents havent seen what these diseases can do. Because we were curious, we wondered how the U.S. vaccination rate stacked up against its more populous companions. The U.S. population is about 319 million, making it the third-most populated country. China, with 1.36 billion people, is at 99 percent. India, with 1.24 billion people, has a rate of 74 percent. Indonesia, at 253 million residents, had a rate of 84 percent. Brazil and its population of more than 200 million residents had a measles vaccination rate of 99 percent. Our ruling Kay said, There are countries in Africa where they have higher vaccination rates than here in the United States. We found ample evidence to back up her point, with several African countries boasting better vaccination rates than the United States. Mauritius, Tanzania and Morocco have nearly complete vaccination of 1-year-olds, according to World Health Organization data.",1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,true

Final Rating: True",Over 50% of the people now in the House and state Senate have not been born in Virginia.,"U.S. Rep. Denver Riggleman, R-5th, recently accused the newly-elected Democratic majority in the General Assembly of embracing liberal policies that are out of sync with Virginia. Democrats last fall won control of both legislative chambers for the first time this century. Riggleman, during a Jan. 23 radio interview on the John Fredericks Show, said the party has gone absolutely loco in passing gun control bills, proposing a gas tax hike to improve roads and backing measures he said will hurt small businesses. He said Democrats could be facing the shortest tenure ever for a majority, based on the craziness coming out of the state legislature. He added, Over 50% of the people now in the House and the state Senate have not been born in Virginia. And most of them, completely new. Theyre not even Virginians by grace yet. We fact-checked Rigglemans statistic. Well leave it to you to determine what, if anything, qualifies a person to be a Virginian by grace. The numbers To learn where lawmakers were born, we consulted their biographies on the House and Senate websites and in General Assembly manuals. In a few cases, we turned to newspaper stories or asked legislative aides. The newly-elected House of Delegates sworn in last month has 52 members born outside Virginia and 48 born inside the state. The newly-elected Senate has 22 members born outside the state and 18 born within. Combining the chambers, 74 legislators were born outside Virginia, 66 inside. Thats a flip from 2019, when Republicans held narrow majorities in both chambers. In the House 52 delegates were born in Virginia, 48 werent. In the Senate, 22 were born in Virginia, 18 were not. Combing the chambers, 74 lawmakers were born inside Virginia, 66 outside. In other words, there was a net addition in both chambers of four members born outside the state. But these numbers are tricky and dont suggest - as Riggleman implies - that those born outside Virginia are alien to its culture. Nine current General Assembly members (six senators and three delegates) listed as being born out of state were delivered across the Potomac River in Washington D.C. Their biographies show six of them (four senators and two delegates) graduated from high school or college in Virginia. If counted, Rigglemans claim about out-of-state majorities would fall. Twelve other legislators were born in states bordering Virginia: North Carolina; Maryland; West Virginia; Kentucky; and Tennessee. Republican Del. Terry Kilgore, for example, has lived in Gate City in Southwest Virginia for all of his life, except when he attended college and law school in other parts of Virginia. But he was born in a hospital 20 miles away in Kingsport, Tenn. and - in Rigglemans claim - doesnt count as a native-born Virginian. Demographics So far, weve been focusing on the details of numbers between 2019 and 2020 and, by strict count, there has been a transition to where a majority of General Assembly members were born out of Virginia. But a broader trend emerges if we use 1960 as our starting point. The increase in non-Virginia legislators over the past 60 years reflects the increase in non-native-born Virginians living in the state. In 1960, Virginia was in the final years of domination by a political machine controlled by Democratic U.S. Sen. Harry Byrd that was rural in origin and segregationist. The House of Delegates had 96 Democrats and four Republicans; the Senate had 38 Democrats and two Republicans. Eighty-five percent of the legislators were born in Virginia, as was 71% of the states population. These days, Virginias politics are dominated by a suburban crescent arching from Northern Virginia through Hampton Roads. Theres been a large migration to the state through these suburbs - particularly Northern Virginia - by a professional class of government workers and contractors. The U.S. Census Bureau estimated that 50.5% of the states population in 2018 was born outside Virginia. That nearly matches the 52% of legislators this year who were not born in Virginia. People like to vote for people who reflect them, said Larry Sabato, a University of Virginia political scientist. These legislators reflect the people they represent. Rigglemans living in the past. Weve become a different state, said Bob Holsworth, a political scientist and consultant. I certainly understand some people who regret that some of the traditions have gone by, but in terms of overall prospects (offered by Virginia), theres a big difference between now and 65 years ago. By the way Although its not part of fact-check rating, we took a quick look at Rigglemans contention that most of the out-of-state legislators were elected last year. Hes wrong. Only nine of the 52 non-Virginia born delegates were elected last fall, as were only five of the 22 senators born out of state. Our ruling Riggleman says, Over 50% of the people now in the House and state Senate have not been born in Virginia. Fifty-two delegates in the 100-member House were born outside of Virginia; so were 22 members of the 40-seat Senate. We have trouble with Rigglemans implication that those born outside Virginia are out of step with the state. Many born outside the state grew up and were educated in Virginia. Moreover, the 52% percent of lawmakers born in other places nearly matches the 50.5% of Virginia citizens born elsewhere. ",1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,true

Final Rating: True","If you look at the number of illegal immigrants coming into the country, it is net zero. It's been that way now for almost two years.","As millions watch them during their national convention in Tampa, Republicans are trying to appear tough on illegal immigration without offending Hispanic voters.Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, who is bilingual and met his wife in Mexico, has warned his fellow Republicans they need to watch their tone on the immigration issue. He repeated that warning in an interview on Meet the Press the weekend before the convention.My personal view is that we need to get beyond where we are, Bush said. We need to create a climate of border control. And thats begun to happen, if you look at the number of illegal immigrants coming into the country, its net zero. Its been that way now for almost two years. And if you say, well, weve gotten a much better grasp on the number of people just coming in without papers, then you could develop a strategy thats part of economic growth. For this fact-check, we will research whether Bush was correct when he said the number of illegal immigrants coming into the country is net zero, and that its been that way for two years.Pew Hispanic Center studiesWe turned to the Pew Hispanic Center for an answer. The center is a nonpartisan research organization that does not take positions on policy issues.Its 2012 report about Mexican immigration concluded, After four decades that brought 12 million current immigrants -- most of whom came illegally -- the net migration flow from Mexico to the United States has stopped and may have reversed. The report was based on the centers analysis of federal census data.We interviewed Jeffrey Passel, a senior demographer at Pew and an expert on Hispanic immigration. He said that Bushs claim is true. Passel said that we can infer that the outflow of unauthorized immigrants exceeded inflows between 2007 and 2009 because the overall size of the unauthorized population living in the U.S. decreased between 2007 and 2009 from 12 million to 11.1 million.There are four ways the number of unauthorized immigrants changes: the inflow of new unauthorized immigrants, the outflow of those leaving the U.S., deaths and unauthorized immigrants gaining legal status.Those last three categories -- outflow out of the U.S., deaths and conversion to legal status -- exceeded the first category of new inflows of unauthorized immigrants by about 900,000 between 2007 and 2009. But deaths and conversion to legal status are not large figures. Therefore, Passel said, the major source of the decline is almost certainly an excess of outflow of unauthorized over inflow.You can read about Pews reports about net migration from Mexico here and in general about trends in the illegal immigration population here and here.We also sent Bushs claim to groups with opposing views on immigration and all agreed that Bushs statement was correct.I think you will find everybody agrees with it being zero or close to it, said Roy Beck, executive director of Numbers USA, which advocates for low immigration.A spokeswoman for The National Immigration Forum, which advocates for immigrants, sent us a New York Times op-ed piece co-written by two professors, one a former foreign minister of Mexico and the other co-director of the Mexican Migration Project at Princeton. That op-ed piece also stated that the rate of undocumented immigration is nearing zero. Our rulingBush said If you look at the number of illegal immigrants coming into the country, it is net zero. It's been that way now for almost two years.It is difficult to get a precise figure on the population of illegal immigrants. But data from Pew Hispanic Center, a widely respected source referred to by those of different political viewpoints on immigration, supports Bushs claim.",1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,true

Final Rating: True  ",2008 was the deadliest year of the war (in Afghanistan) for American forces.,"Long since eclipsed by Iraq, the Afghan conflict, known to the military as Operation Enduring Freedom, has often been relegated to the back pages of the newspaper. Even as it has faded from view, however, the war has grown ever deadlier, President Barack Obama said in a speech to government officials and military officers at the White House on March 27, 2009. It's been more than seven years since the Taliban was removed from power, yet war rages on, and insurgents control parts of Afghanistan and Pakistan, Obama said, announcing the deployment of 17,000 more troops to Afghanistan. Attacks against our troops, our NATO allies, and the Afghan government have risen steadily. And most painfully, 2008 was the deadliest year of the war for American forces. We wondered if that was true and checked the latestPentagon statistics. Indeed, U.S. military deaths numbered 155 in 2008, which is the highest since the war began in 2001. The number of U.S. deaths has increased almost every year, with two exceptions. The year-to-year fatality count, from 2001 to 2008, is: 11, 48, 45, 52, 98, 98, 117, 155. In the first two months of 2009, there were 30 U.S. military deaths, putting this year on pace to be the deadliest yet. We looked for any indication that this statistic was unrepresentative of the conditions in Afghanistan. Quite the contrary — it is one of several measures by which the situation in Afghanistan has deteriorated. The number of U.S. military personnel wounded in action has also increased every year, from 33 in 2001 to 790 in 2008, totaling 2,713. Military deaths of personnel from the 21 other outside countries involved in the conflict have increased every year since 2004, to a peak so far of 139 in 2008 (and 2009 is on pace to surpass that). Afghan civilian casualties hit a high mark too last year, with 2,118 civilians killed, up from 1,523 in 2007, according to the United Nations. In testimony to the House Armed Services Committee in September, Adm. Mike Mullen, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said Taliban and al-Qaida fighters are coordinating better from safe havens in Pakistan and launching ever more sophisticated, even infantry-like attacks against fixed coalition positions. I'm not convinced we're winning it in Afghanistan, Mullen said. Defense Secretary Robert Gates told the committee Afghanistan was in some ways a more complex challenge than Iraq. We don't have a single adversary, he said. We have the Taliban, we have the Gulbuddin Hekmatyar group, we have the Haqqani network, we have narco-thugs, we have al-Qaida, we have foreign fighters. So Obama's claim is not only technically correct, but also accurately reflects the deteriorating security conditions in Afghanistan. We find his claim to be True.",1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,true

Final Rating: Mostly False  ","Says Joe Biden told Americans, If you elect me, your taxes are going to be raised, not cut.","A new ad from a pro-Trump super PAC uses out-of-context footage of Joe Biden to claim that the former vice president wants to raise taxes for Americans across the board. Versions of the ad from America First Action began airing Aug. 4 on Facebook and on TV screens in Wisconsin and North Carolina. They focus largely on a comment Biden made in response to a voter during a February campaign stop in South Carolina. But the America First Action ad presents that remark out of context. And while some tax experts estimate that Bidens plan would mean higher taxes on average for all income groups, those increases would be relatively small for all but the biggest earners.  The 30-second version of the ad opens with a narrator saying, Sometimes, politicians accidentally tell the truth, before cutting to the clip of Biden from the South Carolina event. Guess what, if you elect me, your taxes are going to be raised, not cut, Biden says. The ad replays the clip later, in between additional narration. The New York Times says Bidens tax increases are more than double Hillary Clintons plan. Even the Tax Policy Center admits taxes would increase on all income groups, the narrator says, before showing the clip a second time. Big tax increases, crushing our recovery. The spot finishes with Biden saying, It could go higher. America First Actions portrayal of Bidens comments in South Carolina gives the impression that Biden told a crowd that all Americans would have their tax rates raised on his watch. Thats not the case. When Biden said your taxes are going to be raised, not cut, he wasnt talking about his plan for all taxpayers. He was addressing one person at the February event. The person indicated that they had benefited from the Republican-led tax bill that became law under President Donald Trump. The exchange took place after Biden said, By the way, how many of you did really well with that $1.9 trillion tax cut? Really good shape, right? The crowd mostly laughed or groaned, but one member of the audience caught Bidens attention off camera by signaling that they benefited. Addressing that person directly, Biden said: Well, you did. Well, thats good. Im glad to see youre doing well already. But guess what, if you elect me, your taxes are going to be raised, not cut, if you benefited from that.  The full exchange shows that Biden was saying his plan would raise taxes for people who, in his words, benefited from the GOPs Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. A Biden campaign official said his point was that the wealthy — not all Americans — would not benefit from his plan. The ads portrayal of the exchange leaves a different impression. The same could be said of the ads second clip of Biden, in which he says, It could go higher. The ad doesnt specify what Biden was referring to when he made the remark. But the completeDecember interview with CNBC shows that Biden was talking specifically about the top tax rate for capital gains, the profits earned from selling property or investments, which are often taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income. We should charge people the same tax for their capital gains as their tax rate is, Biden said. And I think we should raise the tax rate back to, for example, I take it back to where it was before it was reduced. It could go higher.  America First Action frames Bidens tax plan as providing increases that are more than double Hillary Clintons plan and would impact all income groups. The ad cites a report from the New York Times and an editorial from the Wall Street Journal, both published in December, as well as a March 5 analysis from the Tax Policy Center, an independent group that models the effects of tax legislation. The New York Times said Biden was proposing more than double the tax increases proposed by Clinton, the Democratic presidential nominee in 2016. Thats accurate, said Gordon Mermin, a senior research associate at the Tax Policy Center and co-author of the March analysis. The Tax Policy Center estimated that Bidens proposals would raise revenues by 1.5% of gross domestic product over 10 years, Mermin said, citing what he said is the preferred metric for comparing across time. The groups analysis of the Clinton plan put that figure at 0.6% of GDP. But the America First Action ad was less exact in its claim that even the Tax Policy Center admits taxes would increase on all income groups. As FactCheck.org noted, thats a partial quote from the groups March report. The full sentence from the report said: In 2021, the proposals would increase taxes on average on all income groups, but the highest-income households would see substantially larger increases, both in dollar amounts and as a share of their incomes. Biden has publicly vowed not to raise taxes for those making less than $400,000 per year. His plan aims to raise up to $4 trillion in tax revenues over a decade, according to the Tax Policy Center, in part by rolling back some of the GOP-led tax laws tax cuts for corporations and for people with taxable incomes over $400,000. Among Bidens proposed changes, he would: Increase the top corporate tax rate to 28% from 21%. Raise the top individual federal income tax rate to 39.6%. Place a 12.4% Social Security tax on incomes above $400,000. Tax capital gains at the same rate as ordinary income for very high earners. The highest earners would bear the brunt of the new tax burden brought on by Bidens plan, according to the Tax Policy Center and other analyses of his proposals. The plan would lead to small, modest increases in costs for lower-income groups, Mermin said. But as weve reported, those changes would not be because of higher federal income tax rates across the board. Those small tax increases for the first four quintiles — and this is said in our brief — are almost all due to the indirect effects of the increase in the corporate tax rate, Mermin said, including lowered wages for workers. On average, the Tax Policy Centers March report predicted that the bottom 80% of earners could wind up paying between $30 and $590 extra annually on Bidens watch. It estimated that over 90% of the tax increases would be borne by the top 20% of earners. No direct taxes are imposed on any household making less than $400,000 per year, the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget wrote in its analysis of Bidens plan. RELATED: Facebook post wrongly claims Biden would hike tax rates for family earning $75,000 Biden has also added to his proposals since March, Mermin said, including pitching some tax credits that could potentially offset some of these increases for the middle-income folks. An America First Action ad showed Biden saying, Guess what, if you elect me, your taxes are going to be raised, not cut. The ad takes his words out of context. Biden was not speaking about the impact of his plan on all Americans. The comment came during a South Carolina event, when a member of his crowd said he or she had benefited from the GOP-led tax bill. The full context of the quote shows Biden saying that individuals taxes would be raised, not cut, if you benefited from that.",0.3,0.9,0.9,0.5,0.4,0.6,0.6,0.8,0.2,mostly-false

Final Rating: Mostly False  ",Californias Proposition 63 would CRIMINALIZE the sharing of ammunition between friends who may be hunting or shooting together.," Proposition 63, a gun and ammunition control initiative on Californias November ballot, would require instant background checks for the sale of ammunition statewide. Known as the Safety For All Initiative and proposed by Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom, the measure is considered a significant addition to Californias already strict gun regulations. The initiative is in some cases more stringent than gun control bills introduced by state Senate leader Kevin De León and recently signed into law by Gov. Jerry Brown. Recently, a gun rights group, the Firearms Policy Coalition, in a June 16 email blast claimed Proposition 63 would restrict not only ammo sales, but criminalize the sharing of bullets between hunting and shooting partners. The Sacramento-based coalition describes itself as a grassroots nonprofit dedicated to defending Second Amendment rights. We decided to examine the claim: Would Proposition 63 really criminalizes the sharing of bullets between friends? Our research We started by checking the text of the Proposition. It broadly restricts ammunition sales by requiring instant background checks and requiring, by January 2018, all sales be conducted or processed through a licensed ammunition vendor, according to Section 8 of the text. Law enforcement would be exempted. Currently, the state does not require a license or record keeping for ammunition sales, according to the San Francisco-based Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence. By contrast, the restrictions Proposition 63 places on sharing or transferring ammunition are not as strict. Still, they would change some aspects of the largely unregulated practice. The measure would: -- Make it illegal for an individual to share bullets with any person who he or she knows or using reasonable care should know is banned from owning or possessing ammunition; -- Make it illegal for someone to share bullets if they know they will be subsequently sold or transferred to a person banned from owning them; -- Require individuals meet face-to-face to transfer ammunition; The new crimes would be classified as a misdemeanors, punishable by up to one year in jail and a $1,000 fine, according to the measure. They are listed under proposed changes to Sections 30306 and 30312 of the California Penal Code. They could still freely transfer and share that ammunition with their hunting and shooting partners provided that they do so in person and do not have knowledge that the ammunition would subsequently be provided to a felon or other prohibited person, Dan Newman, spokesman for the Safety For All Initiative, wrote in an email. Representatives from the Firearms Policy Coalition did not respond to our requests for comment. An AK-47 rifle 30-round magazine is seen with 30 rounds of 7.62x39mm ammunition, in Alexandria, Va., Wednesday, Feb. 10, 2016. (AP Photo/Cliff Owen) Our ruling The Firearms Policy Coalition recently claimed Californias Proposition 63 would Criminalize the sharing of ammunition between friends who may be hunting or shooting together. The initiative would create some new restrictions on bullet sharing. It would be it illegal to knowingly share bullets with a felon; to share with any other person banned from owning them; or with anyone who would subsequently share them with a banned person. It would also require people meet face-to-face to transfer ammunition. Breaking the new rules would be considered a misdemeanor. The coalitions statement, however, gives the wrong and overly broad impression that friends on a hunting trip or at a shooting range could never legally share a bullet -- that somehow the measure would criminalize all aspects of sharing a box of bullets with your shooting partner. Instead, the vast majority of people could keep sharing, as long as they know or within reason should know theyre not sharing with a felon or another person prohibited from owning a gun and ammunition.

Final Rating: Mostly False  ",Greg Abbott did nothing to pursue reports of the sexual abuse of boys at a West Texas state-run school.,"In a TV ad suggesting Greg Abbott failed to act when allegations of misconduct came to his office, Wendy Davis reminds Texans of the sexual abuse scandal that touched off a 2007 legislative overhaul of the Texas Youth Commission. In the ad, a narrator says in a dark tone: Young boys at a state-run school are sexually abused. When a local investigation lags, a Texas Ranger notifies Attorney General Greg Abbott, asking him to investigate. Abbott does nothing, the narrator says, adding that 11 months then went by with more incidents of abuse and neglect. But Abbott didnt pursue the case, the narrator says. By way of backup, the Davis campaign offered news stories describing attempts by a Texas Ranger to get authorities outside of West Texas, including the attorney general, to look into the alleged incidents at the West Texas State School in Pyote. We reviewed those news reports and others, which together chronicled initial inaction by a state lawyer before Abbotts office presented the related allegations to a grand jury. Abbott does nothing? Public knowledge of alleged sexual wrongdoing by officials at the remote school traces to February 2007 news reports by the Texas Observer and Dallas Morning News. But a Texas Ranger, Brian Burzynski, had been on the case for years and had already reached out to the state for help. Burzynski emailed an assistant state attorney general, Will Tatum, on Feb. 21, 2006, graphically detailing sexual abuse of male youths at the school, according to information released by Abbotts office in March 2007. The Rangers email said the local prosecutor had the case but hasn't done anything with it and I am losing hope that he will. ... I would like you to view this report and tell me what you think. Burzynski had begun his investigation in February 2005. According to Abbotts office, Tatum declined to pursue the case because of jurisdictional concerns; under state law, the attorney generals office needed a local prosecutor to ask for assistance before it could get involved. As Burzynskis emailed request became public, Abbotts state spokesman, Jerry Strickland, said Tatum still should have forwarded the report to his supervisors before responding to the email, but he didn't follow agency procedures, according to news reports at the time. Knowing the seriousness of the allegations contained in that email, action would have been taken by the attorney general's office, and this agency would have actively engaged in the matter in any way possible, Strickland said. But Strickland also said that two days after Burzynski sent the email, Tatum correctly told the Ranger that the Ward County district attorney, Randall Reynolds, would have to ask Abbott's office for help on the case. An April 2007 Austin American-Statesman news story said Tatum sent Burzynski the name and address of his supervisor, Adrien McFarland, for the Ranger to give to Reynolds. Abbott acted in 2007 Strickland said the attorney general's office began an aggressive investigation after Reynolds asked for help; that request came in Jan. 17, 2007. In April 2007, a Ward County grand jury returned 13 indictments against two former school administrators for improper sexual conduct with six students, ages 16-19, the attorney generals office announced at the time. Abbott and other state prosecutors appeared before the grand jury to present the charges against former Texas Youth Commission officials Ray Edward Brookins and John Paul Hernandez, Abbotts office said. Abbott said at the time: With today's indictments, the victims of sexual abuse at West Texas State School are a step closer to the justice they deserve. According to the state announcement, on April 4, 2007, District Judge Bob Parks had granted the attorney generals office sole authority to investigate and prosecute allegations of abuse at the Ward County facility. Parks appointed the attorney general as District Attorney Pro Tem after the local district attorney recused himself from the case, the announcement said. Footnote: In April 2010, a jury sentenced Brookins to 10 years in prison on his conviction for sexual relations with a teenage inmate. In 2011, a jury acquitted Hernandez on 14 counts of molesting boys in 2004 and 2005. Texas law on the attorney general and criminal prosecutions Generally, the April 2007 Statesman news story pointed out, the Texas attorney general is an executive who primarily defends the state in civil disputes, though in local criminal cases involving fraud in insurance, Medicaid or elections, the attorney general can usually find a way to involve himself, one way or another. His staff, using a provision in the penal code dealing with computer crimes, can even initiate investigations into the solicitation of sex from minors on the Internet. Charges like the ones from West Texas, the story said, are off-limits until a local prosecutor requests assistance in writing. Eric Nichols, deputy attorney general for criminal justice, told the newspaper the state agency followed the letter of the law. At the time, the Texas Government Code said: A prosecuting attorney may request the assistance of the attorney general in the prosecution of all manner of criminal cases or in performing any duty imposed by law on the prosecuting attorney. In requesting such assistance, a prosecuting attorney may appoint any assistant attorney general as an assistant prosecuting attorney. The 2007 Legislature amended the law to say the attorney general may offer assistance in any criminal prosecution. Another adopted revision: The attorney general may offer assistance in the prosecution of criminal offenses concerning the Texas Youth Commission. The Statesman story said two lawmakers, Democratic Reps. Jim McReynolds of Lufkin and Jim Dunnam of Waco, questioned Nichols about whether Abbotts office should initially have done more: Even if he couldn't initiate prosecution, couldn't he have picked up the phone and called Reynolds, or even the governor, the state's chief executive officer? Nichols said in an interview at the time that Abbotts aides assumed the local prosecutor was doing his job. Do you automatically draw the conclusion that nothing is going to happen? Nichols asked. On the other hand, the Statesman story said, it might not have mattered whether someone in the attorney general's office called Reynolds to offer help. Burzynski told lawmakers in 2007 that Reynolds continually assured him he would prosecute the case. The story said Reynolds had said little in his defense except to blame politics or a breakdown in communications. A timeline accompanying the story said Abbott learned of the West Texas investigation at a meeting of senior agency staff Jan. 22, 2007. On March 9, 2007, Abbott announced the grand jury would soon begin hearing the case. Our ruling In her ad, Davis said Greg Abbott did nothing to pursue reports of the sexual abuse of boys at a state-run school. In 2006, Abbotts office reacted to a Rangers report detailing such allegations by saying a local prosecutor needed to seek state assistance--and a state lawyer reportedly did nothing more. But this charge ignores a pivotal development. In 2007, after the local prosecutor requested help, state attorneys overseen by Abbott steered a grand-jury presentation leading to indictments.

Final Rating: Mostly False  ",El precio de combustible ha aumentado un 25% este año / The price of gas has increased 25% this year.," Cable news is focused on the investigations surrounding President Donald Trump, but theres an issue of intense interest to many Americans that has gotten relatively little media play recently — a rise in prices at the pump. On May 23, Senate Democrats tried to change the media narrative by holding a news event at a gas station near Capitol Hill. The Senate Democrats collective Twitter account documented the event. The account posted a Spanish-language tweet featuring a clip of Sen. Bob Menendez, D-N.J., talking about high gasoline prices and placing the blame on Trump. The Spanish-language text says: El precio de combustible ha aumentado un 25% este año. Los analistas dicen que el presidente tiene la culpa. Gracias @realDonaldTrump. In English, that translates as: The price of gas has increased 25% this year. Analysts say the president is to blame. Thanks, Trump. (Menendez, speaking in Spanish in the tweets uploaded video clip, didnt use those exact words and didnt cite a percentage increase.) So is the tweet correct that gas prices are up 25 percent since the start of the year? Not quite. While prices have increased, they havent risen by that much. We turned to data from the Energy Information Administration, a federal statistical clearinghouse. We found that retail gasoline prices were $2.52 a gallon on Jan. 1, 2018, and rose to $2.92 on May 21, 2018. Thats an increase of 15.9 percent — a distinct bump, but smaller than the tweet had said. When we looked at crude oil prices, the increase was a bit larger than for gasoline but still not 25 percent. On Jan. 2, 2018, crude was $60.37 a barrel and on May 21 it was $72.26. Thats an increase of 19.7 percent. Sandy Fielden, a commodities analyst at Morningstar Inc., told thestreet.com in late April that Trump may be at least a partial cause of the price rise, citing threats of a trade war with China, heightened tensions in the Middle East, and the U.S. exit from the Iran nuclear deal, Fielden said. All these bearish factors pushing prices higher are arguably directly caused by Trump administration policies, Fielden told the website. Trumps suggestion that the OPEC oil-producing companies may be to blame for higher prices is definitely a case of the pot calling the kettle black. After we inquired with the Democratic Senate leadership, the tweet was deleted and a replacement was posted. The new tweets caption stuck closely to Menendez wording in the video, saying, El precio de gasolina sigue subiendo y subiendo. Y es por consecuencia, en gran parte, de la política del presidente. (That translates as, The price of gasoline keeps rising and rising. And it is, to a large extent, due to the president's policies.) The Democratic staff on the Senate Finance Committee subsequently told PolitiFact that the 25 percent figure stemmed from a math error and has since corrected the report it came from. El precio de gasolina sigue subiendo y subiendo. Y es por consecuencia, en gran parte, de la política del presidente. pic.twitter.com/yLbrmBwtxR The original version of the tweet said, El precio de combustible ha aumentado un 25% este año, which translates as, The price of gas has increased 25% this year. Gas prices have risen, but not by that much — 15.9 percent, rather than 25 percent.",0.4,0.6,1.0,0.5,0.0,0.5,0.5,0.8,0.7,mostly-false

Final Rating: Mostly False  ",It has been over 80 years since a lame-duck president appointed a Supreme Court justice.,"The death of U.S. Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia was a key topic at the start of the Republican presidential debate in South Carolina Saturday night. Some of the candidates, including Sen. Marco Rubio, called on President Barack Obama to hold back on his replacement and leave the decision to the next president. I do not believe the president should appoint someone, said Rubio, a Florida senator. And it's not unprecedented. In fact, it has been over 80 years since a lame-duck president has appointed a Supreme Court justice. Lets see what history shows about lame-duck presidential picks to the Supreme Court. We emailed spokespersons for Rubio and did not hear back. Nominations Technically presidents dont appoint a justice to the Supreme Court. They nominate someone who is then confirmed by the U.S. Senate. Theres also the problem of whether Obama should be considered a lame duck or not. Some would say Obama isnt a lame duck until after Election Day in November when his successor is chosen. Others might say all second-term presidents are lame ducks because they know they wont serve again. The definition has evolved, said Larry J. Sabato, director of the Center for Politics at the University of Virginia. Decades ago, the lame-duck label was applied to a president after an election, but the term has changed over time to include any officeholder in his or her last term. Either way, election-year Supreme Court nominations are rare. Rubios statement prompted several comments on Twitter from those who noted a specific exception to his claim: the nomination of Justice Anthony Kennedy. The Senate confirmed Kennedy 97-0 on Feb. 4, 1988. That was about 28years ago -- not 80. Kennedy replaced Justice Lewis Powell, who retired, and was Reagans third nomination for the opening, after Robert Bork and Douglas Ginsburg. Powell announced his retirement in June 1987. Reagan, who was in his second term, nominated Kennedy in November 1987. Kennedy was confirmed in February 1988. In November 1988, Reagans vice president George H.W. Bush won the presidency. The nomination actually wasn't in the election year, although the confirmation vote was, said Harvard law professor Mark Tushnet. This came up minutes later in the debate, when U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas said, We have 80 years of precedent of not confirming Supreme Court justices in an election year. Debate moderator John Dickerson of CBS News corrected Cruz by noting that Kennedy was confirmed in 1988. Were not certain which nomination Rubio was referring to 80 years ago. One possibility is when President Herbert Hoover nominated Benjamin Nathan Cardozo to fill a vacancy in February 1932, and Cardozo was confirmed that same month. Hoover then went on to lose re-election later that year. But Hoover was not a lame duck; he was eligible for re-election even though he lost, said Russell Wheeler, an expert on the courts at the Brookings Institution and former deputy director of the Federal Judicial Center. As of 2010, the Senate has rejected 16 of 34 Supreme Court nominations because of opposition to the nominating president, according to a 2010 Congressional Research Service report. Seven of the rejected nominations were put forward by presidents in their final year in office after a new president had been elected but before the successor took over. But those were more than 80 years ago. Each of these lame duck nominations transpired under 19th century presidents when the post-election period lasted from early November until early March, the report states. Our ruling Rubio said, It has been over 80 years since a lame-duck president appointed a Supreme Court justice. The most recent contradiction of this claim would be Reagans nomination of Kennedy. Kennedy was nominated in November 1987 and confirmed during Reagans final year of office in February 1988. Reagans timeline doesnt exactly line up with what Obama faces; Reagan had more time between his nomination and the end of his presidency. But its hard for us to see how Obama can be considered a lame duck but not Reagan. Both were second-term presidents who knew they would not serve again but did not yet know who their successor would be.",0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,mostly-false

Final Rating: Mostly False  ","One person, Kathleen Sebelius, was going to determine whether or not 10-year-old lung patient Sarah Murnaghan would live or die.","Many Americans were transfixed recently by the story of Sarah Murnaghan, a 10-year-old Pennsylvania girl with cystic fibrosis whose family won a court battle to improve her chances of getting a lung transplant. Under the existing transplant rule, Murnaghan was too young to qualify for a place on the waiting list for adult lungs. So the girls family asked Kathleen Sebelius, the secretary of health and human services, to waive the rule. On May 31, 2013, Sebelius did order a policy review of the age requirements, but that option could take months -- likely longer than the girl could afford to wait. Sebelius declined to waive the rule in a way that would quickly aid her. Sebelius explained her reasoning to a House committee, saying there are about 40 very seriously ill Pennsylvanians over the age of 12 also waiting for a lung transplant, and three other children in the Philadelphia (area) at the same acuity rate as Sarah waiting for a lung transplant. The decisions of the  transplant committee -- which is not bureaucrats; it's transplant surgeons and health care providers who design the protocol -- are based on their best medical judgment of the most appropriate way to decide allocation in an impossibly difficult situation. But Sebelius found herself overruled on June 5, 2013, when U.S. District Judge Michael Baylson ordered her to temporarily waive the rule, allowing Murnaghan to join the adult list. At the House committee hearing, two Republican lawmakers -- Reps. Tom Price of Georgia and Lou Barletta of Pennsylvania-- grilled Sebelius about her role in the Murnaghan case. Soon after, conservative commentators, including Sean Hannity and Rush Limbaugh, took up the 10-year-olds cause and used it to criticize the Obama administration. Sebelius had already been under attack from conservatives for her role in implementing President Barack Obamas health care law. In discussing the Murnaghan case, Limbaugh drew a parallel with Sarah Palin's famous death panels claim, which suggested that the government could determine who lives and dies. (We awarded it our 2009 Lie of the Year.) On his June 6 show, Limbaugh told listeners, Until the judge moved in, Kathleen Sebelius was the death panel. One person, Kathleen Sebelius, was going to determine whether or not (Murnaghan lived or died), and she said, Some people live. Some people die.  All the while, the regime is denying, of course, that there were death panels and that Obamacare was not going to be doing this, and everybody knew that it was. We wondered whether Limbaugh was correct when he said that Sebelius was the sole decision maker. Where Limbaugh has a point Limbaugh is correct that Sebelius did have the power to overrule the age requirements of the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network -- the entity that oversees transplants in the United States. According to the current organ-transplant rules, which were adopted under President Bill Clinton, the networks board of directors is responsible for developing policies for the equitable allocation of organs. However, the rules allow an appeals process to the HHS secretary. The secretary can either reject the complaint, direct the network to revise the policies or practices or take such other action as the secretary determines appropriate. Its worth noting that the HHS secretary has not traditionally taken a hands-on role overseeing day-to-day transplant policy. And historically, a decision to change the rules based on one or two patients cases would be unusual, said I. Glenn Cohen, co-director of the Petrie-Flom Center for Health Law Policy, Biotechnology, and Bioethics at Harvard Law School. Still, Tait Sye, an HHS spokesman, did not dispute that Sebelius had a role in the process. He said that Sebelius decision not to issue a waiver -- at least until told by the judge to do so -- stemmed from her belief that medical experts, not a government official, should take priority. The interest of patients on the transplant list will not be well served by having an individual reach in and unilaterally change an organ allocation policy, Sye said. Given the specifics of the Murnaghan case, we think its reasonable to say that Sebelius, in her role as a source of appeal for the transplantation network, had a role in determining the likelihood of the girl being placed on a transplant list. How Limbaugh ignored others involved in the decision The problem with Limbaughs claim is that he uses the term one person, boiling down what amounts to a life-or-death question to Sebelius alone. Thats not accurate. For starters, if Sebelius had given her blessing immediately to the transplant-list switch, it wouldnt have determined Murnaghans life or death. Switching Murnaghan to the adult list would likely improve her chance of survival, but whether she actually survives depends on the availability of organs, whether they match with Murnaghans blood type, who else ranks ahead of her on the list, how well her own health holds up while awaiting surgery, and how successful the transplant surgery is. More importantly, the system for deciding who gets organ transplants includes several layers of responsibility. The guidelines were put together in an exhaustive rulemaking process, with wide public input. On an ongoing basis, the medical experts on the networks board interpret and enforce these rules. Then, Sebelius serves as a court of appeal. Finally, a federal judge has the power to overrule her appeal, as one did in this case. So there are many people who collectively enforce and interpret the rules. The national organ-allocation network is developed around a consensus of medical expertise and is meant to apply to all transplant candidates ... not to apply uniquely to one individual, said Joel Newman, a spokesman for the United Network for Organ Sharing, which manages the organ-sharing network under contract to the Department of Health and Human Services. Newman added that the rules are designed to provide as many individuals as possible an equitable opportunity to receive a transplant. Several bioethicists we contacted said that despite the obvious sympathy people have for patients like Murnaghan, Sebelius had sound reasons to act as she did. I don't think it would be proper to change the rules for one person rather than alter the entirety of the criteria for who gets priority, Cohen said. Arthur Caplan, a New York University bioethicist, agreed. The system of rules is built on decisions by medical and transplant experts in the area, in this case lungs, he said. No one person can or should have all authority over rationing organs. Appeals to the government or the courts need to be weighed carefully, because by intervening, the authority and legitimacy of an evidence-based, neutral system is put into doubt, and that is not a good thing for society or those waiting for transplants. Jonathan Moreno, a professor of medical ethics and health policy at the University of Pennsylvania, noted that a switch in Murnaghans status is not risk-free. Her medical condition, size and other factors compromise her chances, and a failure here means two dead -- Sarah, and the patient who didn't get the organ, Moreno said. Our ruling Limbaugh said that one person, Kathleen Sebelius, was going to determine whether or not 10-year-old lung patient Sarah Murnaghan would live or die, essentially serving as a one-woman death panel. Its true that Sebelius played an appeals role in the transplant-policy process. However, she was not the only person or entity that did -- existing rules, medical experts and a federal judge also played a role in Murnaghans case. In addition, Sebelius didnt have the power to grant or revoke life; many factors, including the availability and suitability of organs, will ultimately determine her likelihood of survival. UPDATE: On June 12, 2013, Murnaghan underwent lung transplant surgery.",0.3,0.8,0.9,0.4,0.6,0.7,0.5,1.0,0.5,mostly-false

Final Rating: Mostly False  ",Prop 56 cheats schools out of at least $600 million.," Opponents of Proposition 56, Californias proposed $2 per pack cigarette tax hike, are flooding radio airwaves with attacks on the measure. The initiative is one of many on the states November ballot. The No on 56 campaign is funded by tobacco companiesPhillip Morris and R.J. Reynolds. Its campaign says online and in radio ads that the measure cheats schools out of at least $600 million a year. The industry attacks are not surprising. And theyll likely continue as opponents of the measure have raised more than $35 million, while supporters have collected about $17 million. We wondered whether theres any truth to the claim that Prop 56 cheats schools out of all that money. Our research Nearly three decades ago, voters in California approved Proposition 98 requiring a minimum level of funding for public education. It requires the state to dedicate roughly 40 percent of new General Fund revenues to K-12 schools and community colleges. Prop 56 would generateup to $1.4 billion in tax revenue its first year. But instead of sending that revenue to the General Fund, Prop 56 would place it in a special fund to help pay for Medi-Cal, which provides health coverage for millions of low-income Californians. We asked the No on 56 campaign for evidence that the tobacco tax measure cheats schools. A spokeswoman pointed to language in the measure that exempts Prop 56 from the school funding guarantee. The campaign said this exemption is proof that the measure undermines the funding guarantee and cheats schools. But the experts we spoke with say theres nothing new about this proposal. Past tobacco taxes, in 1988 and 1998, also established special funds rather than sending money to the General Fund. One of the experts said the opponents claim is misleading. When I think of this claim that the schools are going to be cheated -- particularly that word cheated out of this money -- that suggests something thats wrong or illegal. And this is not the case, said Steve Boilard, executive director of Sacramento State Universitys Center for California Studies. Theres plenty of examples where new revenue is raised that is not subject to the Prop 98 funding guarantee. Boilard pointed to Proposition 63, a tax on wealthy Californians that funds mental health services.  Curran Kelleher / Flickr Others reject claim State Superintendent of Public Instruction Tom Torlakson rejected the claim that the new tax measure cheats schools. In a recent letter circulated by the Yes on 56 campaign, he wrote: Make no mistake, Proposition 56 will not divert a dime away from schools. Rather, it will raise revenues for school based tobacco prevention and intervention programs. A report by the Legislative Analysts Office estimates Prop 56 will add $20 million for those school based programs. The Sacramento Bees fact-checking team, PoliGRAPH,recently examined the same claim about Prop 56 cheating schools. It found that it isnt fair to say the measure 'cheats'schools out of $600 million a year. Nothing in the measure reduces school funding. If the measure passes, the budget for schools does not decrease. Our ruling The No on 56 campaign is running ads that say the proposedtobacco tax cheats schools out of at least $600 million a year. The measure includes an exemption from the states school fundingguarantee. A portion of its revenues, estimated at up to $1.4 billion, could otherwise have been directed toward school funding. But past tobacco taxes and a tax to fund mental health services have also legally avoided this guarantee. Those had exemptions allowing their revenues to fund health services. This doesn't mean, however, that money will be taken from schools or community colleges under Prop 56. The measure, in fact, sends about $20 million to schools for tobacco prevention programs. The claim that Prop 56 cheats schools goes too far. It might have been accurate to say the measure exempts most all revenue from going to schools. But the term chosen by No on 56 is misleading.

Final Rating: Mostly False  ",Says Donald Trump bans disabled veterans from his high rise.,"A PAC supporting Marco Rubio says Donald Trump mistreats those less fortunate than him -- including disabled veterans. Trump bans disabled veterans from his high rise, states the ad by the Conservative Solutions PAC. The ad has aired in San Francisco and multiple markets in Florida, including Miami and Tampa. Did the New York billionaire give the boot to disabled veterans from his high rise? No, he didnt do that. Instead, he wanted to ban disabled veterans who were given special licenses to peddle from selling their wares in front of his high rise. It is simply not true and a misrepresentation of the facts in every way, Trump spokeswoman Hope Hicks told PolitiFact Florida. A few days after the ad started running on TV, the PAC changed the wording of the line about veterans. We are putting the ads original claim on the Truth-O-Meter, but we will explain how and why the PAC tweaked the wording. Trumps Fifth Avenue high rise Trump wanted to get rid of street vendors around the Trump Tower, a 68-story condo and retail building on Fifth Avenue. The ad shows a Jan. 28, 2016, headline from the Daily Beast: Donald Trump wanted vets kicked off Fifth Avenue. (A spokesman for the PAC referred PolitiFact to the Daily Beast article and the New York Daily News article cited within it.) Peddling exemptions for disabled veterans have a long history in New York. First approved by the state in 1894, the exemption allowed disabled veterans to peddle on any commercial street or park throughout the state. In 1991, the state Legislature took up a bill to amend the law. Most peddling was prohibited on Fifth Avenue -- but 176 disabled veterans still had permission to peddle there. Trump wrote a letter to John Dearie, then-chairman of the state Assemblys Committee on Cities, according to the New York Daily News: While disabled veterans should be given every opportunity to earn a living, is it fair to do so to the detriment of the city as a whole or its tax-paying citizens and businesses? Trump wrote. Do we allow Fifth Avenue, one of the worlds finest and most luxurious shopping districts, to be turned into an outdoor flea market, clogging and seriously downgrading the area? In July 1991, New York City Mayor David Dinkins announced that an agreement had been reached with the Fifth Avenue Association, which represented hundreds of businesses. The businesses would offer disabled veterans jobs at twice the minimum wage, and the association would set up a fund to pay for job training, education or to move vendors to other parts of the city. The next month, then-Gov. Mario Cuomo signed a bill to repeal the peddling, but only for four years. In 1995, when the bill was up for renewal, the Legislature struck a compromise that banned peddling from Midtown Manhattan but included a plan to allow it in other zones to be defined later. Months later, some veterans continued to peddle in the banned area. In 2004, Trump complained about the vendors in a letter to then-Mayor Michael Bloomberg. Whether they are veterans or not, they (the vendors) should not be allowed to sell on this most important and prestigious shopping street, Trump wrote, according to the New York Post. Trump wrote that business owners had to repeatedly clean up debris left as a result of the vendors. Frankly, I have no idea how they can be doing business with the mess they have outside their front door, he wrote. Fifth Avenues comeback is going to be a short one if this situation is not corrected immediately. In response to his letter, a small group of protesters waved signs in front of Trump Tower that read, Vendors to Trump: You're Fired! and Why can't vets vend on streets we die to protect? We told the PACs spokesman that the ad could cause viewers to wrongly assume that Trump wanted to ban disabled veterans from living in his high rise. Ad didnt mention living, Jeff Sadosky replied. PAC changes ad After we started our fact-check, the PAC changed the wording of the ad. The original ad started Feb. 26, according to the Political TV Ad Archive, a website that tracks campaign ads and partnered with PolitiFact and other fact-checkers. On Feb. 29, Factcheck.org wrote that the ad was miseading and left out crucial details. By that date, the ad had aired at least 135 times in the Miami, Tampa and Orlando markets. PolitiFact first contacted the PAC about the ad on Feb. 29 and then later noticed on TV that the script had changed. The original ad said that Trump bans disabled veterans from his high rise. But the new version said that Trump bans veterans from in front of his high rise. Sadosky said the PAC changed the ad on March 1 to be more specific. Our ruling A pro-Rubio Super PAC said Trump bans disabled veterans from his high rise. The TV ad is misleading because viewers could assume that Trump tried to ban disabled veterans from living in his high rise. His beef was with street vendors including disabled veterans who were given special vendor licenses selling wares around his Trump Tower.Nothing in the ad makes it clear that this related to vendors selling on the street.",0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,mostly-false

Martin OMalley was in Austin on a campaign stop, he said immigration reform would pay off for all Americans through their paychecks. In a Nov. 12, 2015 interview on Overheard with Evan Smith, OMalley discussed President Barack Obamas executive order on immigration, and whether he would take similar action. OMalley told Smith he believes the country needs immigration reform because its something important for the economy of the United States. If we pass immigration reform, it will make wages go up on average $250 for the average household, he elaborated. Why? Because youre getting 11 million people in many times off-the-books jobs onto the open economy of the United States of America.

Undocumented immigrants make up 5.1 percent of the U.S. labor force, Pew reported in July 2015. We dont and cant check predictions. Still, we wondered whether it was true, based on research, that immigration reform could mean $250 more for the average American household, as OMalley said. Long-term figure OMalleys campaign press secretary, Haley Morris, said the governor got the $250 figure from a July 2013 White House report, published in support of a 2013 Senate immigration reform bill. That report, The Economic Benefits of Fixing Our Broken Immigration System, states that in the long run, the Senate bill raises wages for all groups of workers by boosting productivity. The White Houses conclusion relies on the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Offices analysis of the economic impact of that bill, the Border Security, Economic Opportunity, and Immigration Modernization Act.  The $250 figure OMalley cites is certainly long term. It refers to a rise in wages between 2013 and 2033 – and doesnt otherwise estimate year-by-year changes. As the White House report breaks it down: CBO estimates that real wages will be 0.5 percent higher in 2033 than projected under current law. In todays terms, that would be equivalent to an additional $250 of income for the median American household. Wages would increase partly because immigration reform would lead to a higher rate of return on capital throughout the next two decades. A web search led us to George Borjas, a labor economist specializing in immigration issues at Harvards John F. Kennedy School of Government. He questioned the assumptions behind the CBOs calculation. To reach its conclusion about immigration reforms effect on wages, the CBO report uses a positivity effect, a name for the effect of a correlation between state GDP and immigration. However, Borjas says, the relationship between higher state GDP and immigration could be correlation, not causation, which would put the $250 figure into question. Borjas, who reviewed the report at our request, said: Maybe immigrants are smart enough to realize they should settle in states with high productivity. Other research released when the bill in question was in the Senate in 2013 supported the CBOs analysis. An August 2013 article from the Brookings Institution compared the bills potential effects to immigrations historical impact on the economy, finding that on average, previous waves of immigrants tended to boost American wages. On the other hand, neither analysis said American households would see an immediate or steady spike in income. Lower wages in the short term Even if the long-term $250 figure holds true, the CBO concluded that comprehensive immigration reform actually would lead to lower average wages in the short-term before boosting overall productivity. In the first decade, according to its analysis, average wages would decrease by 0.1 percent. By the CBO's estimates, average wages would be slightly lower than under current law through 2024 before they rise above current wages the following decade. Comprehensive immigration reform also would lead to a temporary imbalance in the labor market, causing slightly higher unemployment through 2020, when the labor market would adjust. Wages would be lower at first, the CBO says, because growth of the workforce would outpace capital available. In addition, new workers would be less skilled and have lower wages, affecting average wages for the entire workforce. Brookings pointed out that wage decreases would be larger for workers with some high school or only a high school diploma, who would be more likely to compete with new workers, compared to college graduates.  Other considerations Immigration reforms effects on the economy extend beyond immediate and long-term effects on average wages. As Gregory Wright, an assistant professor of economics at University of California-Merced who studies international trade and migration, points out, Immigrants are very entrepreneurial relative to the native population, and high-skill immigrants tend to generate a disproportionate number of patents and are more innovative by other measures. In another section of its report, the CBO specifies that immigrants receive patents at twice the rate of the native-born U.S. population. Additionally, Wright says, immigration reform would create work through demand-side channels. Moving undocumented workers into the open would allow them to raise their own standard of living and they would subsequently demand more housing, education and generally more of all goods and services, which generates work for others, Wright said. Increasing the sheer number of people in the workforce raises output and consumption, or GDP, Wright says. The CBO estimated that immigration reform would raise real GDP by 3.3 percent in 2023 and by 5.4 percent in 2033. Immigrants entering the official workforce will then pay taxes, supporting the aging U.S. population, Wright added. Our ruling OMalleys claim that immigration reform would make wages go up on average $250 for the average household would not be accurate anytime soon. The $250 in question is a calculation based on mathematical assumptions -- assumptions that some question -- that refers to a long-term result over two decades. In the near term, the same analysis projects wages would dip slightly. OMalleys statement contains an element of truth, but the wage-raising conclusion is misleading. MOSTLY FALSE– The statement contains some element of truth, but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.

Final Rating: Mostly False",I negotiated open borders to let fleeing refugees into safety from Kosovo.,"As a way of burnishing her credentials to be commander in chief, Sen. Hillary Clinton made a number of claims during an interview with CNN, including, I negotiated open borders to let fleeing refugees into safety from Kosovo. On May 14, 1999, first lady Clinton visited a refugee camp in Skopje, Macedonia, for ethnic Albanians leaving Kosovo. The trip received extensive press coverage focused on the plight of families trying to escape violence at the hands of Serbian forces. I want to send a message to the refugees that we do not intend to let the evil which (Yugoslavia President Slobodan) Milosevic perpetrated against these people keep them away from their homeland and their homes, Clinton said on the trip. Hillary Clinton's campaign has put forward statements from former Bill Clinton administration officials about the importance of the trip. Richard C. Holbrooke, who negotiated the 1995 Dayton Accords ending the war in Yugoslavia and is supporting Sen. Clinton's presidential bid, said the first lady pressed officials on her trip to keep borders open and then continued to lobby for refugees when she returned to Washington. After visiting refugees and gaining a first-hand assessment of the situation, the first lady had intense talks with President Gligorov and Prime Minister Georgievski, Holbrooke said in a written statement. In these talks, one in the Presidential Palace, another in the residence of the American Ambassador, Christopher Hill, Mrs. Clinton pressed the Macedonian government to fully open the border so that Kosovar Albanian refugees could flee the war zone to safety. The trip seemed more designed to gain media coverage than to conduct substantive diplomacy, however. Clinton visited the area for less than 12 hours, arriving at 9:20 a.m. and leaving at 5:45 p.m. According to the itinerary provided to news organizations, she arrived at the camp and was briefed on relief efforts at 10 a.m., toured the camp at 11 a.m., and met with nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) at 1:30 p.m. Her meetings with officials appear to have been brief. Holbrooke is correct on some of the details he mentions, but the meetings all took place within the space of a single afternoon. The itinerary shows photo opportunities for the traveling press at 2:20 p.m. with Prime Minister Branko Crvenkovski at the U.S. Ambassador's Residence; at 2:50 p.m. with President Kiro Gligorov at the president's residence; and at 3:30 p.m. with first lady Gligorov at the president's residence. TheNew York Timesreported that her visit to the camp was so carefully scripted that administration officials chose which refugees Mrs. Clinton would speak with. Macedonia opened its borders before Clinton visited, so it seems unlikely that she personally negotiated for border openings. But the Clinton administration wanted to make sure the borders stayed open amid concern that Macedonian officials were trying to keep refugees out. In this context, her trip suggests a diplomatic visit intended to reinforce U.S. goals in the region. In her biographyLiving History, she mentions her visit and describes it as supporting the administration's diplomatic agenda around the world, but she does not mention taking part in specific negotiations. We tried and failed to find an independent expert who could speak to her role in negotiating open borders. Janusz Bugajski, an expert on the region with the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, D.C., said via e-mail of her visit, No doubt she tried to help the plight of refugees, but whether she was mandated by President Clinton to speak on behalf of the U.S. administration concerning policy in the region one would need to ask the former president. Our reading of the record shows a good deal to suggest Clinton was concerned about the plight of the people of Kosovo, but almost nothing to indicate she was a major player in border negotiations. We'll give her the benefit of the doubt for traveling to Macedonia and meeting with officials, but the way her statement is phrased, it makes her sound primarily responsible for the United States' efforts in the region. We don't find evidence to support that aside from her less-than-12-hour visit, and so we find her statement to be Barely True. ",0.3,0.7,0.8,0.4,0.2,0.5,0.6,0.9,0.5,mostly-false

Final Rating: Mostly False",Crimea was sort of taken away from President Obama.  And he wanted Russia to be out of what was called the G-8. And that was his determination.," President Donald Trump entered the G-7 summit in Biarritz, France, urging his fellow members to re-admit Russia to the group, from which it had been expelled in 2014. Other G-7 members gave the idea a cool reception. During a post-summit question-and-answer session with journalists, Trump was asked about it. Yamiche Alcindor of PBS asked Trump, Why do you think its appropriate to invite Russia to the G-7, given that theyve meddled in the 2016 election? And are you worried that if Russia does come to the G-7, that it might hurt you politically, because its only going to be a couple months before the 2020 election? Trump said it was better to have Russia inside the room than outside, but he then turned his focus to his predecessor, President Barack Obama. A lot of bad things happened with President Putin and President Obama, Trump said. Trump cited Crimea, a peninsula located on the Black Sea. Following the ousting of Ukraines pro-Russia president Viktor Yanukovych, Russian forces invaded Crimea in 2014 and officially absorbed it into Russia. (Until 1954, Crimea had previously been part of Russia.). It was sort of taken away from President Obama, Trump said. Not taken away from President Trump; taken away from President Obama. President Obama was not happy that this happened because it was embarrassing to him. Right? It was very embarrassing to him. And he wanted Russia to be out of what was called the G-8. And that was his determination. He was outsmarted by Putin. He was outsmarted. President Putin outsmarted President Obama. Experts contacted by PolitiFact said Trumps statement is filled with misleading assertions. For starters, Russia did invade and, eventually, annex Crimea during Obamas presidency -- in February and March 2014. But Russia didnt take Crimea away from either Obama or the United States – it took the region away from Ukraine, of which it which it was an internationally recognized part. Trumps statement is a very odd way of thinking about Crimea and the United States role in Ukraine, said Susanne Wengle, a political scientist at the University of Notre Dame. It is highly misleading and factually incorrect. The U.S. exercised a certain influence among certain Kiev and Ukrainian politicians – how much and whom is disputed – but the U.S. never had Crimea. In addition, Trumps phrasing – sort of taken away – soft-pedals Russias coercive actions in seizing Crimea, said Anders Åslund, a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council. This is not what you call a military occupation, Åslund said. Its also worth noting that, despite Trumps focus on his predecessor, Obama wasnt alone in opposing Russias annexation. Virtually the entire global community refused to recognize the annexation, which was the first such takeover in Europe since the end of the Cold War. Europe, the United Nations and other U.S. allies opposed the invasion and annexation, said Yoshiko Herrera, a University of Wisconsin political scientist. It wasnt just Obama who opposed it. Trumps statement is problematic for other reasons. While the Obama administration did support Russias expulsion from the G-8 over the annexation of Crimea, it did not do so unilaterally, and in fact could not have acted unilaterally. The G-7 was united behind the decision to kick out Russia from G-8, so it was a common consensus decision, Åslund said. In a communique dated March 24, 2014, the leaders of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom, the United States, the European Council and the European Commission jointly wrote that they strongly condemn Russias actions in Crimea. The signatories agreed that they would not participate in a scheduled G-8 meeting in Sochi, Russia, and that they would suspend our participation in the G-8 until Russia changes course and the environment comes back to where the G-8 is able to have a meaningful discussion. To date, the G-8 has not invited Russia back into the fold. All in all, Trump seems to find it hard to believe that there could be any reason other than embarrassment to oppose aggression and territorial dismemberment of a major European state, said Steve Sestanovich, a senior fellow for Russian and Eurasian studies at the Council on Foreign Relations. Trump said that Crimea was sort of taken away from President Obama.  And he wanted Russia to be out of what was called the G-8. And that was his determination. Obama did oppose Russias annexation of Crimea and back its expulsion from the G-8, but Trumps view leaves out much of the story. Trumps remark ignores both widespread opposition to Russians actions within Europe and among U.S. allies, as well as the strongly worded decision by the remaining G-7 nations to expel Russia from the group. It also ignores that Crimea was taken away from Ukraine, not Obama.",0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,mostly-false

Final Rating: Mostly False",Michael Bennet cast the deciding vote for the stimulus and the health care bill.,"If you're seeking to tie your opponent to two controversial bills, what better way to do it than to say he cast the deciding vote to pass them? That's exactly what the National Republican Senatorial Committee is doing in the Colorado Senate race between incumbent Democrat Michael Bennet and GOP nominee Ken Buck.On Oct. 6, 2010, the Senate Republicans' campaign arm ran an ad attacking Bennet's role in helping pass two Democratic-sponsored bills, the economic stimulus and the health care overhaul.One vote makes a difference, the narrator says. Michael Bennet cast the deciding vote for Obama's stimulus that wasted billions, added to the debt and didn't create the jobs they promised. Bennet cast the deciding vote to allow passage of the trillion-dollar health care bill that slashed Medicare, hurting seniors. Bennet's vote was the key to billions in job-killing taxes, too. Michael Bennet: He's been their vote, not Colorado's.We won't tackle the ad's description of the substance of the two bills. (We've addressed some of those points in the past.) Instead, we'll look at whether it's fair to call Bennet the deciding vote on those bills.First, some background on how the bills passed. Both measures had long and roundabout legislative paths to President Barack Obama's desk, but we'll stick to the two votes the ad specifically references on screen.The stimulus vote cited in the ad was taken Feb. 13, 2009. It was to approve the conference report of the bill -- that is, the version that both chambers must pass with identical language. Once both chambers pass identical versions, the bill goes to the president to be signed. For the stimulus, the final vote was 60-38, with exactly the number of votes needed to meet the three-fifths supermajority required of most major actions in the Senate.Meanwhile, the health care vote mentioned in the ad was taken Dec. 23, 2009. The vote was to invoke cloture -- that is, to cut off debate so that consideration of the bill could proceed. Invoking cloture requires 60 votes, and in this case the Democrats once again got exactly the 60 votes required.The idea that the Democrats couldn't spare even a single vote is the crux of the NRSC's argument.Absolutely Michael Bennet was the deciding vote, NRSC spokesman Brian Walsh told PolitiFact. Had he not done so, they wouldnt have passed the health care bill, regardless of whether he was first, middle or last to cast his vote. End of story.But is it? What about the argument that Bennet was merely one of 60 deciding votes. Couldn't the same charge be leveled at every member of the Senate who voted as Bennet did?We ran the issue by a variety of congressional scholars, and most agreed that it was a stretch for the NRSC to label Bennet's vote the deciding vote.That statement is misleading and a distortion of fact, said James Thurber, a political scientist at American University.Several experts we spoke to pointed to historical examples in which lawmakers waited until the last moment to help push the bill over the top.Norman Ornstein, a resident fellow at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, pointed to President Bill Clinton's attempt to pass the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 -- a bill that critics loathe for raising taxes but which supporters praise for eventually producing surpluses in the latter part of the decade. Lacking any Republican support in Congress, the measure faced nail-biter votes in both chambers, with then-Rep. Marjorie Margolies-Mezvinsky, D-Pa., and Sen. Bob Kerrey, D-Neb., attracting wide attention for remaining undecided until shortly before the votes and then ultimately voting yes. In Margolies-Mezvinsky's case, her loss the following year was universally blamed on that vote.Then there was the 1985 vote on President Ronald Reagan's budget by then-Sen. Pete Wilson, R-Calif. Wilson was wheeled onto the Senate floor wearing blue pajamas following surgery for a ruptured appendix. That could be called a deciding vote, said Stephen Hess, a Brookings Institution senior fellow emeritus.Indeed, there's a long and storied history of senators holding back on supporting a bill until certain demands are met, said Donald Ritchie, the historian of the Senate. This approach takes some nerve, because the undecided vote may come under fire from both sides, but the rewards can sometimes be significant, Ritchie said.So, did Bennet's approval of the stimulus and the health care bill follow the same pattern? The short answer is no.On the stimulus, Bennet spoke favorably of the bill at least as early as Jan. 31, 2009 -- two weeks before he cast the vote cited in the ad -- when the Rocky Mountain News paraphrased him saying he likes the overall direction of the legislation. He was part of a bipartisan group of 20 Senators trying to shrink the size of the stimulus, which suggests that he was sufficiently supportive of the bill that he was willing to work behind closed doors to see it succeed. His approach does not seem like that of a reluctant holdout.On health care, Bennet actually took to the Senate floor to forcefully criticize deals struck by party leaders on behalf of holdout Democratic Senators, hoping to persuade them to vote for the health care bill. Columnists opposed to reform have criticized me for saying that I am willing to lose my seat to enact meaningful health care reform, he said on Dec. 21, 2010, two days before the vote. Now, I am being asked why I didn't negotiate a special deal with leadership. In fact, there was a report this morning criticizing me because the National Republican Senatorial Committee was rejoicing that I did not ask for special favors. Only in Washington would someone be attacked for not negotiating a backroom deal. Just because others choose to engage in the same tired Washington rituals, doesn't mean that I have to. Bennet continued, So I have a message for the columnists, the political professionals, and those back home. I am not happy about the backroom deals. I am not happy that the public option was held hostage by people in our own party. I do not support rewarding delay with special deals. I will let others justify their vote and their tactics. Indeed, as the health care debate came to a climax in the Senate, a stronger case can be made that any of several other senators deserve the title of the deciding vote. In a Dec. 24, 2009, account tracing the health bill's Senate endgame, Noam N. Levey and Janet Hook of the Los Angeles Times cited Sen. Joe Lieberman, I-Conn., as a late holdout, due to his opposition to a proposal for a Medicare buy-in. That policy would have allowed certain non-senior citizens to voluntarily join the federal health care plan for the elderly.According to the article, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., knew that he had to keep Lieberman in the tent. And the next night, when Democrats gathered for a special caucus meeting, Reid did not call out the Connecticut senator, focusing instead on the need to unite and move forward. Without the Medicare buy-in, Lieberman would be the 59th vote. At the meeting, Reid turned to Sen. Ben Nelson, D-Neb., who had a long list of demands, including more restrictions on funding abortions and full federal funding to expand Nebraska's Medicaid program. ... Reid was closing in on a deal.Suddenly, another roadblock appeared: Republican opponents of the bill threatened to filibuster -- that is, indefinitely block consideration of -- an unrelated defense appropriations bill as a way of indirectly delaying the health care measure. To get around that, Reid had to convince Sen. Russ Feingold, D-Wis. -- an opponent of the defense bill for substantive reasons -- not to join the Republican blockade.Reid was unwilling to challenge Feingold on a vote of conscience,the Los Angeles Times article reported. And when Democrats gathered for yet another special caucus meeting ... Reid was ready to concede defeat. But as dejected senators began to leave, Feingold arose: He would put aside his convictions on the war, he said, and vote with his party. 'I don't think there was a dry eye in the caucus room,' said Sen. Benjamin L. Cardin, D-Md.And there was at least one more potential deciding vote -- the late Sen. Robert Byrd, D-W.Va. It wasn't a question of whether Byrd would support the bill but rather a question of whether he'd be physically able to reach the chamber to vote.Byrd had spent six weeks in the hospital earlier in 2009 with a staph infection. On the day of the vote, Byrd was pushed onto the Senate floor in his plaid wheelchair, bundled in a coat, scarf and hat, according to an account in the New York Times.Lieberman, Nelson, Feingold, Byrd -- any of them could easily have been described as the deciding vote on the health care bill. So could any of the other 56 senators voting in favor. The NRSC ad is true, but not very informative, since there were 60 deciding votes, concludes David W. Rohde, a Duke University political scientist.The NRSC ad would have been quite justified in describing Bennet's vote for either bill as crucial or necessary to passage of either bill, or even as a deciding vote. But we can't find any rationale for singling Bennet out as the deciding vote in either case. He made his support for the stimulus bill known early on and was not a holdout on either bill. To ignore that and the fact that other senators played a key role in completing the needed vote total for the health care bill, leaves out critical facts that would give a different impression from message conveyed by the ad.",0.4,0.7,0.9,0.5,0.2,0.6,0.5,0.9,0.3,mostly-false

Final Rating: Mostly False  ","Says the Defense Department shrink-wrapped $10.8 billion in American money, loaded it on 175 pallets and put it on a transport plane to Iraq where they passed out $100 bills and no one has any receipts.","Cleveland Democratic Rep. Dennis Kucinich blasts the Iraq war every chance he gets. With Republicans promising budget cuts now that theyve taken control of the U.S. House of Representatives, its not surprising whats at the top of Kucinichs list of potential trims.To meet your stated purpose of protecting American taxpayers from waste, fraud and abuse, it is essential that you examine the Department of Defense and money wasted during unnecessary wars, Kucinich said in a Jan. 4 letter to Oversight and Government Reform Committee Chairman Darrell Issa, a California Republican.Kucinich has also taken to television to make his case for Defense Department cuts. He alleged outrageous abuses during a Jan. 6 interview with Fox News anchor Jon Scott.Listen, when you can have a Defense Department that can shrink wrap $10.8 billion in American money, load it on 175 pallets and put it on a, on a transport plane and ship it to Iraq where they pass out $100 bills and no one has any receipts, when you know that kind of waste is going on, . . . we have concerns in this country that we have to start taking care of, and it's important that we track the misspending that's going on through the Department of Defense so that we can keep that money for the things we need at home, Kucinich said.We thought it would be worth investigating Kucinichs claim that the Pentagon loaded billions of shrink-wrapped U.S. dollars onto transport planes and flew them to Iraq, where these $100 bills were dispensed out without receipts.Kucinich spokesman Nathan White said his boss claim stemmed from a February 2007 House Oversight Committee hearing conducted by the committees then-chairman, Henry Waxman of California, which examined massive shipments of U.S. currency to Iraq as part of the war effort.A transcript of that hearing indicates the money at issue consisted of nearly $12 billion in cash that the Federal Reserve (not the Defense Department) sent to Iraq on C-130 cargo planes, mainly in shrink-wrapped packages of $100 bills, between May 2003 and June 2004. The money wasnt U.S. tax dollars – it came from Iraqi oil sales that were put in a development fund for the Iraqi people. It was sent in cash because no banks or financial system existed in Iraq immediately after the U.S. occupation. Some of the money was used to stabilize the country by launching large public works programs to create jobs. Much of it was given to Iraqi ministries to pay the salaries and pensions of Iraqi civil servants who hadnt had a paycheck since before the war. Although the Iraqi ministries lacked good payroll records, former Coalition Provisional Authority Administrator Paul Bremer told the committee that delaying their payments until better records were available would have been demoralizing and unfair to millions of Iraqi families, and might well have exacerbated danger to the American soldiers on the ground.Under Saddam Hussein, the Iraqi government had been by far the countrys largest employer, providing about four out of five of all jobs, Bremer testified. But for several months, since before the war, millions of Iraqi families had not received money owed them for civil service, salaries or pensions.Special Inspector for Iraq Reconstruction Stuart Bowen, who was charged with auditing money sent to Iraq for reconstruction, told the committee that more should have been done to track how the money was spent. His auditors said nearly $9 billion was improperly accounted for. In a recent interview, he stressed that his findings didnt mean all that money was used improperly, although his office found cases of graft that totaled in the tens of millions of dollars. He said 44 people have been convicted of crimes uncovered by his office.There were weak controls that made the money susceptible to waste and abuse, said Bowen. The money was given to these interim Iraqi ministries who spent it and used it as they chose. The fact that it was Iraqi money didnt in any way diminish our duty to make sure we carried out our fiduciary responsibilities. It was not well managed and not well accounted for.Bowens office released an audit last year that found inadequate accounting for $8.7 billion of another $9.1 billion in subsequent shipments of Iraqi cash that the Defense Department sent to Iraq after January 2004. It found several cases of bribery, fraud and money laundering by U.S. officials that resulted in eight criminal convictions and $7.8 million in fines, forfeitures and restitution payments, the report said.Kucinichs spokesman did not respond to questions asking why Kucinich told Fox that $10.8 billion was at issue, when $12 billion was the amount discussed by Waxmans committee. Bowen said he wasnt familiar with any cases where $10.8 billion were shipped to Iraq on 175 pallets, as Kucinich claimed, though he applauded Kucinichs advocacy for effective Iraq oversight.He is one of the reasons why the Special Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction has been able to succeed in the last seven years of work, Bowen said of Kucinich. Pentagon spending may be a legitimate place to look for budget cuts, but money misspent from this source could not be used for the things we need at home.",0.5,0.7,0.8,0.6,0.1,0.5,0.4,0.7,0.6,mostly-false

Final Rating: Mostly False  ",A collection of photos shows animals caught in the Australia wildfires.,"Destructive bushfires in Australia have torched millions of acres across the region and have killed over 20 people and an estimated 480 million animals. We recently came across a Facebook page that posted a collection of heartbreaking images that purports to show scenes of different animals caught in the fires. Theres just one problem: Many of the images are not from the wildfires in Australia. Some are not even from a fire event. We fact-checked several of the photos in the post, including this viral photo of a tiger on fire that was taken in 2012 in Jakarta, Indonesia. It depicted a bonfire of taxidermy animals. The multi-photo post that included that image has been shared over 84,000 times since Jan. 4 and displays 29 photos showing animals surrounded by smoke or fire, with the caption, Huge wildfire in Australia has resulted in deaths of more than 480 milion animals. Hundred of rare koalas are also reported dead among them. Lets pray for Australia Source: University of sydney report #wildfire. The University of Sydney estimated on Jan. 3 that 480 million animals have been killed in the New South Wales bushfires since September 2019. The post containing this photo gallery was flagged as part of Facebooks efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) We were able to track down several of the photos using the reverse-image search tool, Tin Eye. Here are some that are included in the post with their original locations and dates. (Note to readers that many of these images are disturbing.) An image of a horse being pulled through a smoky field was taken by photographer Étienne Laurent on Oct. 30, 2019, in Simi Valley, California. Horses were being pulled by ranchers to evacuate a burning ranch as the Easy Fire spread. A photo of a deer standing near a burned residence shows the aftermath of the Camp Fire that tore through Paradise, California. The photo was taken on Nov. 10, 2018, by photographer Josh Edelson. (Another image of a deer in the post wasnt taken during a fire event and was found on Adobe Stock Images, titled Red Deer in morning Sun.) An image of a burned cat was also taken in Paradise, California, showing destruction from the Camp Fire. Photojournalist Jane Tyska took the photograph on Nov. 11, 2018.

Final Rating: Mostly True  ",We are the only state in the country that state employees don't contribute [to their pensions].,"Gov.-elect Rick Scott is taking office next month with big plans to cut state spending.One idea Scott has suggested is to cut $1.4 billion in state pension costs by making government employees contribute to their own retirement. Scott brought up the issue during the campaign and again on Dec. 14, 2010, in a meeting with state legislators.What do you all think about employees contributing to the pension plan?'' Scott asked legislators about ways to shrink state spending. We are the only state in the country that state employees don't contribute'' to their pensions.Last year, according to the Sarasota Herald-Tribune, the state and local governments contributed nearly $3.4 billion to the retirement fund, the Florida Retirement System. Governments typically contribute between 9 and 10 percent of an employee's annual income towardretirement. Employees are required to contribute nothing.Is Florida the only state with a system like that?Not quite, according to a PolitiFact Florida review of the state retirement systems of all 50 states. But Scott isn't far off either.PolitiFact Florida individually researched the state retirement systems across the country, as well as consulted with Ron Snell, the director of state services for the National Conference of State Legislatures. Snell studies state pension and retirement systems.Most state retirement systems are based on a defined benefit plan -- a system where the state multiplies an employee's years of service bysalaryandby some percentage to arrive at a pension amount. To qualify, employees have to be vested into the system -- meaning they work for the state for a certain number of years, often five. They also must contribute some percentage of their pay to the overall pension fund. (In most states, individualcontributions don't fund the retirement, but go into the overallpension fund.)A few states, however, have begun to adopt more private-sector-like 401(k) plans where the employee voluntarily contributes to a retirement fund and the employer eithermatches a portion of the contributions, or contributes on their own.And some states offer voluntary, optional 401(k) plans on top of a government pension.With state revenue sources drying up, states have been moving away from 100 percent employer-funded pensions to plans where employees are required to contribute.Missouri, for instance, will start making employees hired after Jan. 1, 2011, contribute 4 percent of their pay to their retirement plan, said Christine Rackers at the Missouri State Employees' Retirement System. Virginia lawmakers this year passed legislation requiring new employees to contribute 5 percent of their pay to their retirement. Current employees are operating under old rules where they do not have to contribute, though Virginia has discussed making them pay, too.Wisconsin also passed legislation making workers pay toward thepensionfund -- though their contribution is as little as .2 percent.Where are governments still footing the entire bill?The largest chunk of state employees in Utah are not required to contribute to their retirement. But a small percentage do.In Tennessee, state employees and higher education employees are not asked to pay toward their retirement, said spokesman Blake Fontenay. But some local government employees and all K-12 teachers are required to contribute, Fontenay said. The state, back in 1981, discussed either having employees contribute toward their retirement or forgo a pay raise that year, Fontenay said. The government chose no raise.And in Michigan, employees aren't necessarily required to contribute to their retirement because they have a traditional 401(k) plan, said Kurt Weiss with the state's Department of Technology, Management and Budget. The state contributes the equivalent of 4 percent of an employee's salary into a 401(k) regardless of whether the employee contributes. The state will then match up to an additional 3 percent employee contribution.A few other states exempt certain, small classes of employees -- like public safety employees -- from having to contribute to their retirement. But in every case, the bulk of state employees are required to participate in the state retirement system through payroll deductions.Wisconsin government analysts crafted a good synopsis of the state retirement plans in 2009 as that state was pondering changes. Contribution requirements are listed on Page 22.A note: Our analysis isn't meant to say Florida's retirement plan is a better deal for state employees than employees in other state governments. It's entirely possible that other state employeesreceive better pensions than Florida workers, even after accounting for employee contributions. Our focus solely was on where employees are asked to contribute to their retirement. And as we previously pointed out, Florida has the lowest payroll expenditures per resident -- $38 -- in the country, according to the state Department of Management Services. The national average was $72 per resident.Which brings us back to Scott's statement. In a meeting with state legislators, Scott suggested the state might save money by requiring state employees to contribute to their own retirement. Specifically, he said, that Florida is the only state in the country where government workers are not required to help fund their retirement.Scott is largely on the mark.Florida will be the only state, starting Jan. 1, 2011, where no one in the state retirement system is asked to contribute toward their pension. Two states -- Virginia and Missouri -- recently switched their retirement system meaning new hires will have to pay toward their retirement, but not existing employees. Michigan doesn't force its employees to participate either, but that state has a more private-sector-like 401(k) program. And Tennessee and Utah still do not require many of their state employees to contribute toward retirement, although other employees in those states do.",0.8,0.5,1.0,0.7,0.0,0.2,0.3,1.0,0.6,mostly-true

Final Rating: Mostly True  ","Approximately 60,000 Canadians currently live undocumented in the USA.","U.S. Rep. Cori Bush said the treatment of Haitians at the U.S. border is not about immigration but something more sinister — and she shared a statistic about ourNorth American neighbors to the north as evidence. Approximately 60,000 Canadians currently live undocumented in the USA, tweeted Bush, a Missouri Democrat, Sept. 23. You dont see the militarized presence, cops on horseback, and calls for a wall on that border. The issue has never been about immigration. Its about anti-Blackness and racism. Bushs criticism came as the Biden administration dealt with fallout from its handling of thousands of Haitian migrants who in September crossed the border illegally into Texas. Images and videos of Border Patrol agents pursuing the migrants prompted outcry from some within Bidens party, as did the administrations decision to expel thousands. For decades, the U.S. governments treatment of refugees has varied greatly depending on where they are from. An Associated Press analysis of asylum data, for example, found that from October 2018 through June 2021 Haitians were granted asylum at the lowest rate of any nationality. We wanted to know if Bush was right about the number of undocumented Canadians in the U.S. We found that her statistic is in the ballpark of some available data, but the data lacks precision. Bushs congressional office declined to comment since she tweeted from her personal account. Her campaign did not respond to our query. There is no exact science for calculating the size of the unauthorized population in the United States.We reached out to nonpartisan experts and found that while their estimates vary, they tend to be in the same ballpark. The Migration Policy Institute estimates that approximately 57,000 unauthorized immigrants from Canada resided in the United States as of 2018, accounting for less than 1% of the 11 million unauthorized immigrants in the country. Some of the largest pockets of unauthorized immigrants from Canada were in Los Angeles, the Boston area, Floridas Broward County, Arizonas Maricopa County, and Washington states King County, the Migration Policy Institute found. The Pew Research Center estimated that in 2017 there were about 80,000 unauthorized immigrants from Canada. That estimate had a margin of error of +/- 15,000, which puts it in the same ballpark as the Migration Policy Institute number. The number of unauthorized immigrants from Canada has been dropping steadily in recent years, said Jeffrey Passel, senior demographer at Pew. For unauthorized Canadians, a figure of 60,000 for today is roughly consistent with the findings of our research, Passel said. Robert Warren, a senior fellow at the Center for Migration Studies, estimated that in 2019 the undocumented Canadian population in the U.S. was 32,000. Warren is a former longtime demographer for the U.S. Census Bureau and the former Immigration and Naturalization Service. None of these estimates rely on post-COVID era data, so they do not reflect a snapshot of what has happened during a period when it has been more difficult to cross the U.S. border. The Department of Homeland Security releases annual reports on the number of foreign visitors who came to the U.S. legally, but stayed beyond the time period for which their admission had been authorized. These visitors are referred to as visa overstayers, although Canadians generally dont require a visa to visit the U.S. for a few months. Ravi Jain, a Toronto-based immigration lawyer who is also licensed to practice law in Massachusetts, told us that undocumented Canadians in the U.S. are often looking for work, some as models, actors and singers. When they get a gig, they stay. Sometimes they find a romantic partner in the U.S. and just just dont file the paperwork timely, too. The Homeland Security overstay report for 2019 showed out of about 10 million expected departures, there were about 84,000 suspected Canadian overstayers. The overstay estimates available could be inflated. To give a concrete exampleYou have a temporary visa that calls for you to leave the U.S. on Sept. 28 but you leave on Oct. 2. You will be counted as a suspected in-county overstay as of the end of the fiscal year (Sept. 30) even though you have left the country, Passel said. Bush tweeted that approximately 60,000 Canadians currently live undocumented in the USA. Its difficult to pinpoint a precise count of undocumented Canadians, but Bushs number is in the ballpark of data by experts including those at the Migration Policy Institute and the Pew Research Center.

Final Rating: Mostly True  ","Thirty years ago, the United States ranked sixth among advanced economies in the share of women in the workforce. You know where we are today? Twenty-three.","During a visit to Howell, Mich., President Joe Biden touted key agenda items under negotiation in Congress. One of the proposals he wants to see receive final Congressional approval is support for child care, which he said would benefit both children and their parents, including mothers who want to take jobs outside the home. How can we compete in the world if millions of American parents, especially moms, cant join the workforce because they cant afford the cost of child care or elder care? They have to stay home, Biden said in the Oct. 5 speech. He went on to say that the United States had fallen behind its industrialized peers in the percentage of women in the labor force. Thirty years ago, the United States ranked sixth among advanced economies in the share of women in the workforce, Biden said. You know where we are today? Twenty-three. Twenty-two countries have a higher percentage of their women in the workforce making a competitive wage than the United States. While our competitors are investing in the care economy, were standing still. Has the United States really fallen so far behind in womens participation in the labor force? Our research shows it has. We asked the White House for a source, and they pointed to data from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, a think tank that studies advanced industrialized nations. The data broadly supports how Biden characterized the shifts between 1990 and 2020. There are multiple ways to measure the phenomenon Biden addressed — notably, what age ranges are used. If you look at the labor force participation rate for all women at least 15 years of age, the United States ranked seventh in 1990, behind Denmark, Sweden, Estonia, Finland, Norway and Canada. But by 2020, the United States ranking had fallen to 17th. (Labor force participation rate refers to the percentage of a given group that is either employed or is actively seeking work.) An alternative statistic — the labor force participation rate for women in the prime working ages of 25 to 54 — shows an even steeper U.S. decline. In 1990, the United States ranked seventh, behind the same six countries. But by 2020, the U.S. had fallen to 31st. The White House used a slightly different version of the OECD data than we did, which accounts for the differences in the U.S. rankings. But multiple economists told us that the differences in rankings were minor, and that the trend line was much more important. Specifically, the U.S. percentage of women working basically stagnated over those 30 years, even as 13 nations leapfrogged the U.S. between 1990 and 2020: Belgium, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Israel, Japan, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Portugal, Spain, and the United Kingdom.  However you define it, I think the president is highlighting genuine trends, said Gary Burtless, an economist with the Brookings Institution. Historically, women in the U.S. gravitated to the labor force earlier than women in other countries did. Right after World War II, only about one-third of U.S. women were in the labor force, but by the late 1990s, that percentage had risen steeply, to the low-60% range. Since then, however, it has plateaued and even fallen modestly overall.  By the early 1990s, the United States ranked higher on this measurement than most of its economic peers. Since the 1990s, the downturn has been driven mostly by married women with a college degree, particularly those married to high-earning men, said Stefania Albanesi, an economist at the University of Pittsburgh. Albanesi said her research suggests that a rise in earnings of college-educated men, particularly those at the top of the income distribution, has reduced the pressure for married women to take paying work outside the home. As the U.S. rate began to fall, other nations caught up. Several factors drove these international shifts, economists say. One is that women in other countries have belatedly made gains in educational attainment, giving them a boost in the labor market. But perhaps the biggest difference comes from the lack of social policies in the United States that enable women with children to take jobs. The policies that are common in other industrialized countries but not in the U.S. include publicly provided child care services, an entitlement to paid parental leave, laws giving workers the right to demand a change to a part-time work schedule without exception and without being discriminated against, said Mihaela Pintea, an economist at Florida International University. The upshot of the lack of such policies in the U.S. is that its costly or burdensome for women with kids to remain in the workforce after they have a child, Burtless said. Claudia Goldin, a Harvard University economist, cautioned that its tricky to make cross-national comparisons on labor-force participation. Perhaps the biggest factor complicating Bidens comparison is that countries define part-time work differently. Generally speaking, when looking only at participation among women who work full-time hours, the U.S. ranks higher in international comparisons, Goldin said. If you did this comparison just for full-time work, wed be up there, she said. If you weighted by hours, wed be up there. Pintea added that, despite grim statistics like those cited by Biden, U.S. women who are working may still be better positioned in some ways. Effectively, the U.S. labor market environment pushes women to either skip working entirely or take a full-time job, rather than finding a middle ground. In a lot of other countries, women might work part-time as opposed to full time and may be less likely to be promoted into managerial positions, or may have lower wages than their male counterparts because of their career path, she said. Biden said, Thirty years ago, the United States ranked sixth among advanced economies in the share of women in the workforce. You know where we are today? Twenty-three. The specific rankings vary a bit depending on what measure one uses, though by one measurement, the U.S. position is even worse than Biden said. The general conclusion is the same: The United States used to rank near the top of the pack of industrialized countries in womens participation in the labor force, but over the past 30 years, many other countries have leapfrogged the U.S. in that measurement, as the rate in the U.S. stagnated or even fell. Economists say the U.S. rate has been lagging for several reasons, including a lack of government policies encouraging child care and paid leave and other countries catching up to the United States earlier gains in womens educational attainment.",0.8,0.2,1.0,0.7,0.1,0.2,0.5,1.0,0.6,mostly-true

Final Rating: Mostly True  ",House Democrats have a two-to-one advantage money-wise against House Republicans.,"On the Aug. 1, 2010, edition of ABC's This Week with Christiane Amanpour, the show's host asked House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., how she felt when President Barack Obama's spokesman, Robert Gibbs, suggested a few weeks earlier that the Democrats could lose their House majority in the fall elections. Pelosi exuded confidence. You know what, I'm speaker of the House, Pelosi said. I have a great chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, Chris Van Hollen. We have a solid plan of messaging and mobilizing at the grassroots level and management of our campaigns. And we have a two-to-one advantage money-wise. So we feel very confident about where we are, whether that's well known to that gentleman or not. We thought the part of Pelosi's comment worth checking was that House Democrats have a two-to-one advantage money-wise against House Republicans. Because Pelosi mentioned the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee just two sentences earlier, we began by looking at the money statistics for the DCCC and the parallel GOP organization, the National Republican Congressional Committee. Both groups work to elect members of their party to House seats. According to the Center for Responsive Politics, a Washington-based group that tracks money in politics, the DCCC had $33,783,724 in the bank through Aug. 3, 2010, compared to $17,039,525 for the NRCC, and neither committee had any debt. That works out almost exactly to a ratio of two-to-one -- just as Pelosi said. But while the DCCC/NRCC ratio for cash on hand is probably the best statistic to use, it isn't the only one. So we decided to look at a handful of others for comparison. -- The ratio of money raised for the DCCC and NRCC -- not just what's left in the bank. The DCCC has raised $93,706,323 during the 2009-2010 campaign cycle, compared to $75,531,984 for the NRCC. That's a 1.24 to 1 ratio -- a much more even split than cash on hand. -- Money totals raised and held by House candidates themselves, rather than by the DCCC or the NRCC. When you look at money raised by the candidates themselves, the Republicans have actually raised slightly more than the Democrats as of Aug. 3, 2010 -- $355,067,654 to $351,238,367. Meanwhile, Democrats running for the House have $245,223,757 in the bank, compared to $173,422,985 for Republican candidates. That's a ratio of about 1.4 to 1. Since the Republicans have more candidates running for the House, we also decided to adjust these numbers to reflect amounts raised and held per candidate. The Democrats lead in total money raised per House candidate, $589,326 to $323,670 -- a 1.82 to 1 ratio. They lead by an even larger ratio in cash on hand per House candidate -- $411,000 to $158,000, or 2.6 to 1. -- Independent expenditures. Independent expenditures are dollars spent on campaigning by sources other than the candidates' own campaign treasuries. Through July 11, 2010, $19,017,868 was spent independently either for Democratic candidates or against Republican candidates, compared to $7,776,690 spent in support of Republicans or against Democrats. That's a ratio of about 2.4 to 1 favoring Democratic candidates. So let's sum up. When comparing the DCCC and the NRCC in cash on hand, Pelosi is on target when she says that there's a two-to-one Democratic advantage. But using four other measures, the Democrats have a smaller lead, including one case in which the Republicans narrowly lead. Using two other measures, the Democrats have a lead of greater than two to one. Of course, these statistics can change before Election Day, and it's not especially surprising that the Democrats lead the Republicans in fundraising -- being the incumbent party in power. Either way, we think the single best statistic to use is the one Pelosi cited correctly, so we'll rate her comment Mostly True.",1.0,0.0,1.0,0.8,0.0,0.0,0.5,1.0,1.0,mostly-true

Final Rating: Mostly True  ",57% of the jobs created in Austin from 2009 to 2013 do not pay families a living wage.,"Austin isnt as affordable as it needs to be, mayoral aspirant Steve Adler says on his campaign website, adding: Our children cannot afford to live in the Austin where they grew up when they graduate and leave home. Even during a time of historic job growth, 57% of the jobs created from 2009 to 2013 do not pay families a living wage. We wondered about that percentage. By email, Adlers campaign manager, Jim Wick, said Adler saw the figure in an April 26, 2014, Austin American-Statesman news analysis by Dan Zehr citing data compiled by Idaho-based Economic Modeling Specialists International, which analyzes workforce-related data. That story said that while the Austin metro area had gained thousands of jobs in recent years, inflation-adjusted earnings had fallen. Then came the declaration that drew Adlers attention, which didnt speak generally to families or to jobs in Austin alone. From 2009 to 2013, the article said, almost 57 percent of the newly created jobs in the area paid less than the living wage for a single parent with one child ($19.56 per hour), according to data from EMSI and the oft-cited living wage calculator created by researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. That living-wage figure, identical for Travis and Williamson counties, appears on web pages overseen by Amy Glasmeier, an MIT professor of economic geography and regional planning. According to the entries, the living wage is the hourly rate that an individual must earn to support their family, if they are the sole provider and are working full-time (2,080 hours per year). To our inquiry, Zehr provided a spreadsheet he built based on increases or decreases in jobs across more than 730 professions in the Austin-Round Rock Metropolitan Statistical Area, also showing the estimated median hourly wage for each of the professions. By email, EMSI spokesman Joshua Wright said its median hourly wage data came from the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics and that information was benchmarked to the firms own industry-by-industry data drawn from agencies like the BLS and U.S. Census Bureau. By our calculation, some 53,315 of the 92,620 net jobs added in the Austin area from 2009 to 2013, or 58 percent, had a median hourly wage less than the living wage for a single parent with one child. These lower-wage jobs encompassed 394 types of jobs including positions in oil, gas and mining as well as loan interviewers and clerks, pest control workers, skin-care specialists and medical secretaries, according to the spreadsheet. In reviewing these details, we also wondered if the outcomes for Austin workers were as dire as Adler said. For instance, the MIT website presents lower living wages including, for Travis and Williamson counties, $18.51 an hour for two adults and a child; $14.88 for two adults only; and $9.43 for one adult alone. If you focus on earnings at a lower living wage, in turn, youre going to conclude more workers fared better. According to the spreadsheet, for instance, 40,560 of the 92,620 net jobs gained from 2009 to 2013, or 44 percent, had median hourly wages less than $14.88; 15,099 of the net jobs gained, 16 percent, had median hourly wages less than $9.43. It also occurred to us the median wage might not be a perfect way to gauge who exactly is earning enough to get by. That is, the median wage in each occupation is the boundary between the highest paid 50 percent and the lowest paid 50 percent of workers. It stands to reason, then, that some workers in the 57 percent still made more than the living wage for a single parent with a child. But its also so that some of the other 43 percent made less than the same living wage.  The limits of public wage data evidently make it difficult to calculate a precise percentage. Next, for an independent look at this claim, we turned to Cynthia Osborne, a University of Texas associate professor and director of the Child and Family Research Partnership at the Lyndon B. Johnson School of Public Affairs. By email, Osborne told us the 57 percent figure might be right, but shed need more information -- particularly the variations in wages around each median -- to reach a conclusion. EMSIs Wright told us he didnt have that type of information, but could share the wages for each occupation at specific points along the wage curve. Daniel Dillon, a research associate for the partnership, later said three interpolations drawing on this added detail basically confirmed about 57 percent of the jobs added in the Austin area didnt pay the living wage for an adult with one child. Our ruling Adler said: 57% of the jobs created from 2009 to 2013 do not pay families a living wage. To be precise, thats the estimated share of net jobs added in the multi-county Austin area (not Austin alone) pegged as having median wages less than the living wage for an adult with one child. Families vary in size, though, as do related living wages. MOSTLY TRUE – The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information.

Final Rating: Mostly True  ","The President wants to cut 3 MILLION people from SNAP, including children, seniors and veterans.","Over Thanksgiving week, a North Carolina Democrat drew attention to a Trump Administration proposal that would cut the number of people who receive public funding for food. U.S. Rep. Alma Adams, a Democrat representing the Charlotte area, tweeted on Nov. 26 about the administrations proposal for cuts to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, known as SNAP. The President wants to cut 3 MILLION people from #SNAP, including children, seniors and veterans, Adams tweeted. This is unacceptable. SNAP is the first line of defense against hunger and I stand with @TheBlackCaucus to protect Americas most vulnerable: our children. #1MillionKids. Is it true that the Trump administration is proposing to cut 3 million people from the SNAP program? Does that proposal include children, seniors and veterans? There are multiple proposed changes to the SNAP program, The SNAP program provides nutritional assistance to people who are low-income or disabled. Adams referred to proposed changes to categorical eligibility. And, as it turns out, the Adams claim is mostly on-point. 3 million The proposed change to categorical eligibility rules would affect 3.1 million people currently receiving those benefits, according to the USDAs own estimates. SNAP currently allows states to grant categorical eligibility to people who are already on other social programs. The USDA believes some those people wouldnt qualify otherwise. As a result, some households can qualify when they would not under regular programs rules, the department wrote in a fact sheet. The Trump administration sees this change as closing a loophole allowing some to abuse a program thats intended to be a temporary safety net, NPR reported. Whos affected? We reached out to the USDAs Food and Nutrition Service department for insight on how many SNAP participants might be affected by the proposed change. An estimated 673,000 households with seniors and 597,000 households with children are projected to lose benefits, the USDAs communications office told us in an email. As for military veterans, the number is a little less clear. We reached out to the USDA and other groups that track SNAP beneficiaries, but struggled to find a specific number of veterans that might be affected. Veterans not tracked USDA does not have data to determine the specific impacts of the rule on households with veterans, as veteran status does not impact eligibility and therefore is not captured in the caseload data used to analyze the rule, the USDA told us. But its possible veterans would be affected. About 40 million people participate in the SNAP program. About 1.4 million veterans live in participating SNAP households, according to a 2018 study by the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. The center analyzed data provided by the U.S. Census Bureau and estimated SNAP is currently assisting 55,000 veterans in North Carolina. Rebecca Vallas, a senior fellow at the left-leaning Center for American Progress, believes its more than fair to conclude veterans would be affected. She believes Adams is on strong footing. Our ruling Adams said President Trump wants to cut 3 million people from SNAP, including children, seniors and veterans. Its true that his administrations proposal would affect 3 million people, including children and seniors. Veterans also receive SNAP benefits, but we dont know how many veterans would be directly affected. Given that uncertainty, we believe Adams statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information.",0.8,0.6,1.0,0.7,0.5,0.4,0.3,1.0,0.5,mostly-true

Final Rating: True  ","North Korea has a substantial standing army, one of the largest, certainly the largest per capita, in the world.","In recent weeks, the North Korean government has made numerous increasingly provocative statements threatening South Korea and the United States, at one point warning South Korea that our retaliatory action will start without any notice from now.  As the rhetoric was escalating, U.S. Sen. Jack Reed, a Rhode Island Democrat, spoke of North Koreas military capabilities during an appearance on WJAR Channel 10s 10 News Conference. Reed was asked about North Koreas recent moves and generally about what threat it could pose to the United States. Reed said that there is concern that, in five or more years, North Korea could increase its capability to launch nuclear missiles that travel longer ranges. They have a substantial standing army, one of the largest, certainly the largest per capita, in the world, he said of their conventional, non-nuclear, military. We wanted to know whether North Korea -- officially the Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea -- really has such a large force, based on the best-known information. The caveat of best-known is underscored by a recent New York Times news analysis, which reported on the difficulties the United States faces getting accurate intelligence about the country and raised questions about the accuracy of information about things such as nuclear weapons. We contacted Chip Unruh, Reeds spokesman, who e-mailed links to several documents. One is a U.S. Department of Defense report to Congress on North Korea that says that countrys total military -- army, air and naval capabilities -- ranks in personnel numbers as the fourth largest military in the world. It fields primarily legacy equipment, the report states, meaning hardware based on designs of the Soviet Union and China, dating back to the 1950s, 60s and 70s, though a few systems are based on modern technology. According to the Department of Defense report, at about 950,000, the ground forces comprise the vast majority of North Koreas military. The report estimates that country has some 60,000 naval personnel and 92,000 air force personnel -- a total of about 1.1 million. Several other sources provided by Unruh, including a March 28, 2012, statement before the House Armed Services Committee by Gen. James D. Thurman, commander of the United States-South Korea combined forces, supported the statement that North Korea has the fourth largest military in terms of sheer manpower, behind China, the United States and India. The 2012 U.S. Department of States Bureau of East Asian and Pacific Affairs fact sheet said the estimated active-duty military force in North Korea is as many as 1.2 million personnel. Unruh also supplied a link to a short 2011 article and graphic in The Economist magazine. Using data from 161 countries for which such information was available, according to the magazine, the graphic said China had the largest active military in number of personnel -- more than 2.25 million -- while the United States was second with upward of 1.5 million active-duty personnel. India was third in manpower. The Economist placed North Korea fourth in overall personnel at about 1.2 million, but the Economist also noted that, if looked at per population, North Korea was, by far, the most heavily militarized of all, saying there were 49 military personnel for every 1,000 North Koreans -- a ratio greater than that of any other nation. China has a population estimated at 1.3 billion people, with 1.7 military personnel for every 1,000 Chinese, and the United States has a population estimated at more than 316 million, with 5.5 military personnel per 1,000. We checked the CIAs latest estimate, for July 2013, which put North Koreas population at about 24.7 million people. Finally, we contacted the International Institute for Strategic Studies, which issues an annual report The Military Balance on nations military capabilities. Mark Fitzpatrick, director of the institutes nonproliferation and disarmament program, e-mailed that Reeds statement sounds correct to me but suggested checking the militaries of some smaller nations such as Israel. The Economist reported that Israel had 23 military personnel per 1,000 population. Of course, sheer manpower numbers arent necessarily a good measure of a nations military capability. And analysts often assert that much of North Koreas technology and hardware is outdated or obsolete. But thats beyond the scope of our analysis. Our ruling U.S. Sen. Jack Reed, D-R.I., said, of North Korea: They have a substantial standing army, one of the largest, certainly the largest per capita, in the world. Numerous publicly available documents support his claim.",1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,true

Final Rating: True  ","Says since he took office, the City of Milwaukee has seen the creation of 7,000 new affordable housing units.","Seeking his fifth term as mayor, Tom Barrett has focused on bringing more jobs and housing to Milwaukee, among other issues. On the campaign trail, and again in his Feb. 10. 2020 State of the City address, Barrett has touted his 10,000 Homes Initiative, announced in 2018, which aims to increase affordable housing availability in the city by building or improving 10,000 housing units within 10 years. That reminded us of a claim from his Nov. 20, 2019 campaign launch we wanted to check. I am more optimistic now than I have ever been about the future of our city, Barrett said during that speech, before touting various accomplishments. Its about building for the future of this city. Weve done so by creating homes, 7,000 homes. The issue of housing in Milwaukee has also entered the mayoral race. Primary opponents, including state Sen. Lena Taylor, D-Milwaukee, have criticized Barretts record on housing. Is Barrett, first elected in April 2004, correct that 7,000 homes have been created since he took office? Lets take a look. When asked for the evidence to back up the claim, Barretts staff directed PolitiFact Wisconsin to a Department of City Development (DCD) report. The report shows that as of October 2019, a total of 7,261 affordable housing units had been developed since Barrett took office in 2004. Of those, 690 were downtown and 6,571 were outside downtown. All are rental units. The majority are apartments located in both newly-constructed buildings and existing buildings, including offices, manufacturing space, warehouses and vacant schools that have been redeveloped into apartments, said Martha Brown, deputy DCD commissioner, in an email. The total also includes several hundred new single-family homes, and both one- and two-family vacant houses that have been completely rehabilitated and made available as affordable rental housing. Milwaukee housing changes Map shows the change in the number of residential properties in each aldermanic district from 2004 to 2019. Design: Eric Litke, Milwaukee Journal SentinelSource: Wisconsin Elections Commission  According to Brown, the developments were financed with federal Low Income Housing Tax Credits allocated by the Wisconsin Housing and Economic Development Authority. Under the program units are deemed affordable based on a variety of factors, but cant go to anyone making more than 60% of the median income for the area. For a family of four, the cut-off would be $49,380. In many cases, the apartments are earmarked for those making an even smaller percentage of the median income. Brown also noted that Habitat for Humanity develops affordable housing for homeownership and those units were not included in DCDs count. Brian Sonderman, executive director of Habitat for Humanity Milwaukee, said since 1984 the group has built or rehabbed 620 single-family homes and has assisted more than 700 additional families through affordable home repair and loan assistance. We believe affordable homeownership is key to helping local families build strength, stability and independence, Sonderman said in an email. Sonderman said the city has helped the process with acquisition as well as funding. For instance, the city may sell vacant lots to the group for $1 each. Habitat also receives federal grant money allocated through the city. So, by the numbers, Barrett is on target. Is there anything else to consider? Residential vs. apartments According to the city Assessors Office, the count of residential properties as reported on the citys 2004 Statement of Assessment (the year Barrett was elected) was 135,352. The number from 2019 showed 137,098 parcels. But that figure accounts for only residential housing and condos, not the apartments that are the focus of the tax credit program. In August 2019, Mike Ruzicka, president of the Greater Milwaukee Association of Realtors, sent a letter to community leaders in Milwaukee, Ozaukee, Washington and Waukesha counties urging officials to think twice before approving more apartment projects. Greater Milwaukee is following a trend seen across the country, he wrote. Numerous multifamily units are being built at the expense of owner-occupied condominium and single-family units. Indeed, at the same time the city has been adding affordable housing units, it has been busy bulldozing derelict ones. Between April 1, 2004 and Oct. 31, 2019, some 3,542 units were razed by the city, and 3,123 razed privately, for a total of 6,665 units razed, according to the city Department of Neighborhood Services. These are not places where people live; and in many instances, removal of these blighted structures spurs additional neighborhood revitalization and growth, said Christina Klose, a department spokeswoman. Our ruling Barrett said since he took office, the city has seen the creation of 7,000 new affordable housing units. The numbers back him up: Through affordable housing programs, 7,261 units have been created since Barrett took office.",1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,true

And he offers his record as governor as proof of his commitment to that goal.The research clearly demonstrates high-quality early childhood opportunities help children succeed, he wrote in a paper laying out his economic policies. Thats why we expanded participation in Virginia in early childhood programs by nearly 40 percent...We checked whether Virginias early childhood programs really did grow by 40 percent during Kaines term as governor from 2006 to 2010.During his gubernatorial campaign, Kaine proposed making Virginias pre-kindergarten program available to all 4-year-olds -- not just those from families living close to the poverty line. The universal access was estimated to cost $300 million a year.Once in office, Kaine scaled back that ambition in the face of a recession that eroded state revenues. But he did seek increases preschool programs every year during his term.Budget records show he proposed an extra $4.6 million for the 2007-08 fiscal year to add 1,250 children to the program. In his full biennial budget, which covered 2008 through 2010, Kaine sought $56 million in additional funding, according to reports. The request was pared to $40 million, then $22 million, as lawmakers sought to cope with the recession.Over the course of Kaines term, the Virginia Preschool Initiative saw a steady rise to its annual budget from $46.3 to $58.6 million. (That trend has continued into the recently approved budget, which provided $68.2 million for 2013 and $68.5 million for 2014.)Virginia Preschool Initiative teaches social and learning skills to 4-year-olds who will become eligible for free or reduced lunch programs when they enter public schools. The pre-K program is open to at-risk children who live above the poverty line. Children below that line qualify for the federal Head Start program.In the 2005-06 school year, when Kaine took office, 11,343 children were enrolled in Virginias preschool initiative.

Final Rating: True  ",More than half of Virginias school buildings are older than 50 years.,"State Sen. Jennifer McClellan, D-Richmond, is leading a bipartisan effort this winter to raise money to repair and replace Virginias aging school buildings. Studies have shown more than half of Virginias school buildings are older than 50 years, she and Sen. Bill Stanley, R-Franklin, wrote in a Feb. 15 guest column published in The Roanoke Times. We wondered whether the figure is correct, particularly in the wake of a Feb. 11 fire that gutted Richmonds 111-year-old William Fox Elementary School. An advisor to McClellan pointed us to a June 2021 report the Virginia Department of Education gave to a legislative commission studying the conditions of the states school buildings. More than half of all school buildings are greater than 50 years old, the report said, using almost the same words as the guest column. The report surveyed 2,005 school buildings across the state and found 1,017 of them - or 52% - were at least 50 years old as of June 2021. The median, or middle, age was 52. Here are percentages of local schools at least 50 years old: Chesterfield, 38%; Hanover, 48%; Henrico, 64%; Richmond, 72%. McClellan says the state and localities are falling behind on renovating and replacing old schools and, without change, the problem will worsen. Shes proposed a number of bills that would raise more money for modernization. The measures include: Allowing all localities in Virginia to impose a 1% increase in their sales tax, subject to voter approval, for school construction or renovation. Only nine localities are now granted that option; Letting local school systems set aside operating budget surpluses for school construction; Lowering the interest rates on state loans to localities for school construction and upgrades; and Expanding state aid for school building projects. Her bills easily passed in the Democratic-led Senate with bipartisan support. But identical measures have been killed in the Appropriations Committee of the Republican-led House. Its unclear whether there will be any movement in the House, where the majority has been focused on Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkins agenda of cutting taxes. We should finally note that problems with aging school buildings are not confined to Virginia. In June 2020, the U.S. Government and Accountability Office reported that about half of the nations public school districts need to replace multiple building systems or features. The average age of U.S. school buildings was 44 in 2013, according to the most recent survey by the National Center for Education Statistics. McClellan writes, More than half of Virginias school buildings are older than 50 years. State Department of Education records show 52% of Virginia schools had crossed the half-century mark in June 2021. ",1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,true

Final Rating: True  ","Says, Since 1994 when VAWA was first passed, incidents of domestic violence have dropped more than 50 percent.","Violence - or the potential for violence - is everywhere. Its the reason we have police and laws, jails and federal programs to study the causes and suggest responses.Its the reason, too, that Congress passes laws to address crime in all its facets. One of those is the Violence Against Women Act, which is intended to protect women from domestic abuse and violence. It provides federal dollars for an array of programs to achieve that goal. Oregon, for example, collected $9.4 million in 2012 for programs to protect women from violence.The law was first passed in 1994 and easily renewed in 2000 and 2005 by lopsided majorities. But it was allowed to lapse in 2011 after a partisan Congress couldnt reach agreement. (Partisanship in Congress? Shocking, we know.)Now its back and in an effort to build momentum and the votes to renew it, supporters like Sen. Jeff Merkley, D-Ore., have been talking about the laws benefits.Heres what Merkley said Feb. 7 during a conference call with reporters: Since 1994 when VAWA was first passed, incidents of domestic violence have dropped more than 50 percent.That seems to be a pretty strong selling point and as the bill moves toward a final vote in the Senate its something that will be repeated and emphasized during debate.But is it true?First, we need a quick fly-by of the law and what it provides. The law, known by the shorthand VAWA, first passed in 1994 and was written by then senator and now Vice President Joe Biden.It acknowledged domestic violence and sexual assault as crimes, and provided federal resources to encourage community-coordinated responses to combating violence. When it was re-authorized in 2000 lawmakers expanded the definition of crime to include dating violence and stalking. Its subsequent reauthorization in 2005 created new programs to meet the emerging needs of communities working to prevent violence.Until it expired in 2011, the law was expansive and reached into every corner of the country. (Some funding continued into 2012.) Among other things, it provided grants to states and local law enforcement to beef up enforcement as well as money to prosecutors to focus on gender-based crime. Included in the array of programs and assistance, VAWA provided money for direct services for victims of sexual assault and for things like transitional housing and legal assistance.According to Merkley, all those programs made a difference.Which brings us back to his claim that since it was first enacted domestic violence has fallen 50 percent.Another fortunate development when it comes to crime is that governments at all levels but especially the federal government go to great lengths to quantify, parse and sub-total crime. Data abounds.Its also unambiguous.From 1994 to 2010, the overall rate of intimate partner violence in the United States declined by 64 percent, from 9.8 victimizations per 1,000 persons age 12 or older to 3.6 per 1,000, the U.S. Justice Departments Bureau of Justice Statistics reported in November 2012.The report notes that over that same period 4 in 5 victims of intimate partner violence were female.A report by the National Network to End Domestic Violence, an interest group focusing on the issue, comes to a similar conclusion.The rate of nonfatal intimate partner violence against women has decreased by 63 percent and the number of women killed by an intimate partner has decreased 24 percent, between 1994 and 2010.The group connects the numbers directly to the VAWA, saying the law has changed the way federal, tribal, state and local entities respond to domestic violence, sexual assault, dating violence and stalking.Surveys by the American Bar Association and other independent groups had similar findings.Thats a lot of scholarship and paper, sponsored, collected and analyzed by federal and independent researchers. And while the results dont perfectly align, all agree that the incidence of domestic abuse has dropped by more than 50 percent since the Violence Against Women Act was passed in 1994. You can quibble about the minor differences but not the accuracy of Merkleys statement.",1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,true

He says that he is the only candidate in the race who will refuse to join the Public Employees Retirement System.Is he the only candidate in the race to make such a promise? Perhaps just as important a question: Are elected officials even able to decline joining the retirement system?The Public Employees Retirement System is a hot-button issue with critics who claim it eats way too much money, hurting taxpayers to benefit public employees. The retirement program is open to participating employers, from the state of Oregon to school districts and cities.We turned to Paul Cleary, the retirement system's executive director. He pointed to Oregon Revised Statutes 238A.100 (2):  A person who is elected or appointed to an office with a fixed term ...may elect not to become a member of the pension program by giving the Public Employees Retirement Board written notice not later than 30 days after taking office. The trick here, says Cleary, is that for a person to decline membership, that person cannot have been a PERS member, ever. Ludlow is a former Wilsonville city councilor and served as Wilsonvilles mayor from 1989 to 1991, but received no retirement benefits from his time in public office.Ludlow, 63, says he has never been a member of PERS, and the Public Employees Retirement System confirms he is not a member.The other Clackamas County commission chair candidates are members of the Public Employees Retirement System. They are county Chairwoman Charlotte Lehan, county Commissioner Paul Savas, and state Rep. Dave Hunt. They cannot opt out. Savas said he never knew he could decline to join.

Final Rating: True  ",Says that Tennessee law requires that schools receive half of proceeds -- $31 million per year -- from a half-cent increase in the Shelby County sales tax.,"Education funding issues often provoke emotional arguments, and a measure to increase the local option sales tax in Shelby County by a half cent has led to accusations that an education-advocacy group is trying to manipulate voter sensibilities with misleading claims about the benefits for school-children.We've covered some education funding issues before, like the claim that the education burden on Tennessee and Shelby County taxpayers is among the lowest in the nation (Mostly True) and the assertion that local governments have not increased spending on schools over six budget cycles (True).In this case, Stand For Children is leading the campaign to persuade voters in Memphis and unincorporated Shelby County to raise the local option sales tax levied by the county from the current 2.25 percent to 2.75 percent (the state sales tax rate is 7.0). The overarching message on expensive, glossy mailers -- the future of the adorable children smiling in photos will be brighter if voters approve the half-cent sales tax increase.Stand is allied with a bi-partisan coalition of supporters, including Memphis Mayor A C Wharton and most of the Memphis City Council, Shelby County Commission chairman Mike Ritz, Memphis Congressman Steve Cohen and the majority of the unified Shelby County Board of Education. They argue the increase is necessary to help fund the $57 million shortfall that Shelby County's schools merger Transition Planning Commission says will occur if all their schools consolidation recommendations are approved by the unified county school board.Opponents, including Shelby County Mayor Mark Luttrell and Memphis City Councilman Jim Strickland, contend that until a clearer picture is available for the exact budget needs of the consolidating school systems in Memphis and Shelby County, it is premature to levy an additional tax.Stand is making a slew of claims, some of which elude the Truth-O-Meter process because they involve opinions, hypotheticals and interpretations about the will of elected officials. Small change can make a big difference for all of our kids reads one line, and another claims the revenue will make our schools better. Both are clearly opinions.Stand also says the money will allow for expansion of pre-kindergarten and training for teachers, while also possibly helping expand hours at libraries and community centers. Strickland especially objects to what he calls the pre-K promise, and indeed it remains to be seen whether the school board will follow through on the recommendations of the Transition Planning Commission and its own committees and staff to expand pre-K. There are budget and logistical issues that could delay or derail the plan to offer pre-K to all children who need it.Stand in some cases has adjusted, for instance, by qualifying its language on pre-K. But on one issue it has only raised the volume -- that whatever else is argued about increasing the county sales tax, $31 million is guaranteed to flow to the county's schools because state law requires half of the proceeds of a local option sales tax to be spent on schools.That's the claim we are examining here.When we contacted Stand, its Memphis-based state director, Kenya Bradshaw, almost immediately emailed back a copy of Tennessee Code Annotated 67-6-712, Distribution of revenue under the The 1963 Local Option Revenue Act.Bradshaw was a member of the county Transition Planning Commission that made pre-K for all who need it one of its highest priorities, and she carries around an actual copy of the statute.It deals with the local option sales tax and very plainly states that one-half (1/2) of the proceeds shall be expended and distributed in the same manner as the county property tax for school purposes is expended and distributed.It also says that the the proceeds can be pledged to the punctual payment of principal of and interest on bonds, notes or other evidence of indebtedness but doing so requires the approval of the local school board.Estimates of the revenue expected to be raised from that county sales tax increase have run between $60 million and $62 million -- it depends in part on projections of future economic activity. So $30-31 million per year would, in fact, be guaranteed for schools. The half that does not go to schools is returned to the municipalities where they were collected, and of that non-schools portion $23 million is expected to flow to Memphis.One core issue is that approval of the countywide increase would trump the votes in August referendums by suburban municipalities to apply a half-cent local option sales tax as a way to raise revenue to fund municipal school districts they hope to operate.Opposition to the increase in some suburban municipalities is therefore fierce, because it would mean lower overall revenue than was expected for some municipal school districts. Some opponents argue that the vote is basically an anti-suburban municipal schools money grab by Memphis interests. Residents in those suburbs do not get a vote because they already have authorized sales tax increases for their towns.Another argument by proponents is that a vote against the half-cent sales tax increase is essentially a vote for a property-tax increase to fund the expected budget gap created because of schools consolidation.Our rulingThere is clearly much for voters to consider on the referendum to increase by a half-cent the county's sales tax rate, and the contentiousness related to the Shelby County's reorganization of public schools has created some confusion for voters.On one of the most crucial issues, Stand For Children claims half the proceeds from the local option sales tax must go to schools. The statute is definitive and the claim is True.",1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,true

Final Rating: True  ",Too many tattoos on visible body parts keepsome applicants out of the military.,"Failing test scores aren'tthe only problem that has caused the military to reject applicants, says former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush. Another problemis, well, more colorful: tattoos. While talking about his push to improve public education at the Wall Street Journal CEO Council event Dec. 1, Bush pointed to problems the military has finding qualified applicants. Bush mentioned a video in which a military official talked about the challenge: In the video beforehand, Gen. Dempsey talked about a 25 percent pass rate. Now thats not just because of the test, thats also because of obesity, and too many tattoos, to be honest with you, on visible body parts for people that are trying to get into the military. But the pass rate for a high-school-level test to join the military is about 35 percent, I think, or 40 percent at best. These are abysmal numbers. PolitiFact has previously fact-checked claims about whether obesity and physical fitness have kept applicants out of the military (both true).But we hadnt explored the role of tattoos in filling the military ranks. We couldnt resist taking a look. Tattoo policies Each branch of the service sets their own rules about tattoos, but it was the Armys policy that has drawn the most ink recentlyfrom the media. In March 2014, the Army overhauled its appearance policy, which includes more than two pages of detailed rules about tattoo, branding and body mutilation. This led to a rush to get tattedso soldiers could be grandfathered in under the new rules. The Army has a detailed procedure for grandfathering that directs unit commanders to document each tattoo in an official memorandum. The Armys policy states that tattoos, regardless of subject matter, are prohibited on certain areas of the body, including the wrists, hands and fingers, as well as the head, face, and neck, defined as anything above the t-shirt neck line to include on/inside the eyelids, mouth, and ears. Soldiers may have no more than four visible tattoos below the elbow (to the wrist bone) or below the knee, the policy says. So far under the new policy, 2,919 applicants could not process due to tattoos,said Brian Lepley, an Army recruiting spokesman. Those 2,919 are the ones whose tattoos were so egregious it was highly unlikely a waiver could get through, or the applicant chose not to try a waiver, he said. In the Army, 193 tattoo waivers for applicants have been granted, while one was rejected and four are pending. Lepley told us that tattoos are not the No. 1 disqualifier. Medical conditions, drug use, misconduct or some combination of those issues disqualify more applicants. News reports around the country indicate the tattoopolicy is limiting applicants, though. Right now, with the new tattoo policy in effect, we currently turn away one in every five applicants that come through our door, U.S. Army Captain Joshua Jacquez told CNN in a report from El Paso. Maj. Gen. Allen W. Batschelet, head of Army recruiting at Fort Knox, told the Kansas City Starin August that the policy is, rather arbitrary, in some sense. However he said that you have to draw the line somewhere for the Army to present a professional image. As for waivers, Batschelet said,To be blunt, the higher quality of applicant you are, the more tolerance we'd probably have for seeking a waiver. If you came in to sign up today and were a neurosurgeon, I got to tell you I'd go a long way toward trying to get an exception if all you had was a disqualifying tattoo. The Air Force,Marines and Navy also have their own tattoo policies. All of them generally ban tattoos that are obscene, advocate discrimination or express offensive views. The Air Force policy has a seven-step measurement guide that contains math formulas in an attempt to prevent tattoos from covering more than 25 percent of an exposed body part. (Partial inches should be rounded up to the nearest inch, it says.) The Marines policy states that applicants with more than four tattoos must be administratively reviewed. The Navys policy is the least detailed --only 277 words -- though like the other services, it bans head tattoos. Our ruling Bush said that among the reasons applicants are rejected by the military -- in addition to being obese or not passing the test -- is that some have too many tattoos on visible body parts. Since the Army updated its tattoo policy earlier this year, 2,919 applicants could not proceed due to tattoos. Other branches of the service also have restrictions on types and locations of tattoos that keep some applicants out of the military.",1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,true

Final Rating: True",A record number of immigrants not from Mexico are being apprehended at the border.,"Questioning the flow of unaccompanied Central American children across the Texas-Mexico border, Gov. Rick Perry declared he has yet to hear from President Barack Obama or his administration to a 2012 letter urging attention to the matter. Perry went on to say on Fox & Friends June 17, 2014: We have record-high numbers of other than Mexicans being apprehended at the border. These are people that are coming from states like Syria that have substantial connections to terrorist regimes and terrorist operations. Both of those claims drew our interest, though for this story, were tackling only Perrys statement that a record number of immigrants not from Mexico are being apprehended at the border. Well check his reference to people coming from states like Syria in another article. The increased flow of children from Central American nations has attracted attention, in part, Douglas Massey, a Princeton University professor, suggested this month, because fewer Mexicans are being detained near the border than any year since 1971. An online U.S. Border Patrol chart shows about 265,000 Mexicans were caught near the border in the fiscal year that ran through September 2013. That was up 3,000 from the year before, according to the chart, but down at least 15,000 compared to any of the previous dozen years. News reports suggest multiple factors in this surge including a contrast: The Border Patrol routinely and quickly returns immigrants from Mexico across the Rio Grande; that's not an option for handling individuals from distant countries like El Salvador and Honduras. So, have non-Mexican detentions at the border reached a record level? To our inquiry, Perry spokeswoman Lucy Nashed said Perry drew his conclusion about a record being set from information provided by the Texas Department of Public Safety. We turned to the Border Patrol for numbers. The federal agency posted an online chart indicating its officers apprehended 153,055 people from countries other than Mexico in the fiscal year that ran through September 2013. Thats more than in any of the seven previous years. That chart shows, though, that 165,170 other than Mexicans were apprehended in fiscal 2005. The numbers include all Border Patrol regions, including the northern border with Canada and coastal boundaries. Every year, though, the vast majority of such apprehensions occur in the agencys Southwest Border region, running from San Diego to the tip of Texas. And what about the South Texas portions of the border that have received attention recently? The chart shows nearly 115,000 apprehensions from countries other than Mexico in the agencys Laredo and Rio Grande Valley sectors in fiscal 2013, which outpaced the previous high of 100,647 in fiscal 2005. Tighter focus: The 96,829 other than Mexico apprehensions in the Rio Grande Valley sector in 2013 was 21 percent greater than the sectors previous high (at least since fiscal 2000) of 79,854 such apprehensions in 2005. By telephone, a Del Rio-based Border Patrol spokesman, Dennis Smith, brought us up to speed on other than Mexico apprehensions from October 2013 through May 2014, or the first eight months of fiscal 2014. In that period, he said, there were 165,729 such apprehensions nationally, including 162,749 in the Southwest region, counting what would be a 15-year high of 122,071 (and counting) in the Rio Grande Valley sector. Separately, analyst Jessica Vaughan of the Center for Immigration Studies, a think tank focused on reduced immigration, emailed us its chart demonstrating a surge since early 2011 in other than Mexico apprehensions in the Rio Grande Valley sector:   We asked Smith if for historys sake, we should try to gauge apprehensions before 2000, the earliest year on the Border Patrols chart. Smith said there werent more such apprehensions any year before 2000. Our own brief look for older data led us to a Sept. 22, 2005, report by the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service indicating fewer people from countries other than Mexico were apprehended in 1997, 1998 and 1999. Finally: The number of unaccompanied children being picked up also has been record-setting, according to a June 4, 2014, New York Times news story. Since Oct. 1, a record 47,017 unaccompanied children have been apprehended at the southwest United States border, the story said, most traveling from Central America, part of a larger wave that includes some youngsters accompanied by their parents and some traveling alone. The story said that according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection, that 47,017 total is nearly twice as high as all of the last fiscal year (24,493 apprehensions), with four months yet to go in the current fiscal year. And, a June 5, 2014, Times news story said, an internal draft Homeland Security document projects unaccompanied-minor apprehensions rising to 90,000 in the current fiscal year, running through September 2014. Peter Boogaard, a Homeland Security spokesman, told the paper the draft document was not official policy and had not been finalized or circulated. Our ruling Perry said a record number of immigrants not from Mexico are being apprehended at the border. We didnt come up with apprehension figures for every year through history. But available figures show the Border Patrol apprehended more people from countries other than Mexico along the border through the first eight months of fiscal 2014 than it apprehended in any of the preceding 17 years.

Final Rating: True  ","Between 1980 and 2010, water usage in Georgia dropped even as the states population grew.","The bad news regarding water in Georgia is legion. No major reservoir has been built since the 2007-2008 drought to insulate metro Atlanta from future water shortages. Water/sewer rates have gone up in several counties to cover everything from federally mandated upgrades to increased material costs. Then there is the so-called water war with Alabama and Florida, a multi-year battle of lawsuits over how to meet the water needs across the states. So it was a surprise to read the recent headline in the Athens Banner-Herald: Water use in Georgia declines, even as population grows. The trend, the May 10, 2015 story said, was a 30 percent drop in water usage in the three decades between 1980 and 2010, the last year that federal data was available. Suffice it to say the claim whet our appetite – we save wetting our whistle for after-hours – for the numbers and what might be going on. We reached out to the U.S. Geological Survey, which has a mandate to file a water usage report for the nation every five years. In concert with that work, the agency encourages states to conduct their own reports. Georgia has compiled a report every five years since 1975, in a bid to provide information about the precious resource in a state without a single natural lake. The 1980 report shows that year, Georgia sucked 6.7 billion gallons of water from Georgia rivers and aquifers every day. In 2010, it sipped 4.7 billion gallons every day. While the reports in that overall span show some increases – including a 21 percent jump in daily use during the 1990s – water usage has plunged 30 percent when looking at the three decades. Census figures show the number of people living in Georgia over that period exploded, from 5.46 million in 1980 to 9.69 million in 2010. Thats a 77 percent increase. Given the well-known water woes in the Peach State, how is that possible? Conservation plays some role, which we will get into in a moment. But the biggest factor was the change in how thermoelectric plants across the state operated. Several of the facilities were decommissioned between 2000 and 2010 – during the worst of the drought years and the decade that saw usage plunge nearly 28 percent, said Steve Lawrence, a hydrologist with the USGS in Atlanta. Several other plants converted from coal-fired, which needs plenty of water to cool it as an energy source, to natural gas, Lawrence said. Thermoelectric withdrawals account typically for a third of withdrawals, so all water withdrawals decrease when such a large user drops its share, Lawrence said. Data is not available for 1980 for the per capita usage in Georgia. But 1985 and 2010 figures mirror the overall trend. Every Georgian used about 860 gallons of water daily in 1985 but only 470 gallons daily in 2010, Lawrence said. Those totals include a persons share of water that a utility, say Georgia Power, uses to provide electricity. Its unclear what the per person usage would be in 1985, if the water used by agriculture, industry and utilities are removed. But in 2010, it was an estimated 75 gallons a day per person to bathe, cook and clean, Lawrence said. Thats a good number, one you see with the push for water-efficient fixtures and conservation efforts like tiered pricing, Lawrence said. Local water providers, however, dont always follow the statewide trend. The Cobb County Water System can provide daily usage dating back to 1986, when the then-small county used just 38.6 million gallons countywide. In 1990, when the county had about 451,000 people, average daily use was 42.5 million gallons countywide. In 2010, about 688,000 people lived in Cobb, and daily usage was 57.1 million gallons for the county. Thats a 53 percent jump in population, and a 34 percent increase in daily usage. Although the daily usage did not keep pace with the population increase, the jump itself bucks the state trend. However, water system officials point out that Cobb saw usage drop 14 percent countywide between 2006 and 2014, during the worst of the recent droughts. The 2014 daily usage, of 104 gallons per person, also is down 15 percent from the 122 gallons per person in 2005, when the county began looking at per capita usage. You can see very clearly the impact of our water conservation efforts, which became much more aggressive in 2008, county spokeswoman AikWah Leow said. Our ruling News reports claimed that Georgia has seen its water usage drop over the past three decades, in the same period that the population mushroomed. Federal reports confirm that unlikely shift, largely due to a change from coal-fired electric plants to facilities powered by natural gas. Conservation efforts also have made an impact, even if local water systems dont show quite the same drop in usage. But the statewide trend is clear.",1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,true

Final Rating: True  ",Says that in the recent year homeowners across Ohio have signed mineral rights agreements and I understand that over a billion dollars worth of leases have been signed to date.,"Ohio Gov. John Kasich has enthusiastically cheered the money-making prospects of hydraulic fracking, a technique used to extract oil and gas from underground shale.Eastern Ohio, with its energy-laden Utica and Marcellus shale formations, is high on the list of targeted areas where companies are looking buy up rights to drill for the lucrative resources below.But many have voiced environmental concerns over the process, which pumps millions of gallons of chemical-laced water and sand deep into horizontal wells under high pressure. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency is studying hydraulic frackings effects on drinking water. And New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, a Republican whose pugnacious and conservative style is often compared with Kasichs, last month ordered a one-year moratorium on the practice so more information can be gathered. Enter Ohio State Sen. Michael Skindell. Skindell, a Lakewood Democrat, this month introduced Senate Bill 213, which would institute a ban on hydraulic fracking until the EPA completes its study and lawmakers have time to digest it. A companion bill would require companies to disclose chemicals it uses when drilling. Both pieces legislation are aimed at what Skindell sees as a fracking bonanza. In the recent year, we have seen the oil and gas companies go to homeowners throughout Ohio and encourage them to sign leases and turn over mineral rights for this process, Skindell said during a Statehouse news conference to promote the two bills. And I understand that over a billion dollars worth of leases have been signed to date. That billion-dollar figure caught PolitiFact Ohios attention, given the relatively fledgling fracking market. True, reports across Ohio have pegged the Utica shale formations in eastern Ohio as a new frontier of sorts. But $1 billion? We went to Skindell to learn his source. Skindell shared with us a web link to a March story published by the Dayton Daily News. The newspaper focused on one company, Chesapeake Energy Corp. of Oklahoma City. Chesapeake, the article noted, has reportedly spent $1 billion acquiring leases in Ohio without drilling a producing well, a figure reported by the Wall Street Journal on March 7. By the time it left Skindells lips, it was a fact repeated at least third-hand. If it was a fact all. So off to the Wall Street Journal we went. The March 7 story attributed the $1 billion figure to Chesapeake. Journal reporter Ryan Dezember referred PolitiFact Ohio to earnings statements and other financial documents from the publicly held company. Mindful that the news at this point was 6 months old, Dezember theorized that the figure had likely grown. Sure enough, a transcript of a July 29 conference call between Chesapeake executives, investors and analysts and Chairman and Chief Executive Aubrey McClendon confirmed this. ... Weve spent between $1.5 billion and $2 billion acquiring leasehold in the Utica, said McClendon, referring to the shale in eastern Ohio. And of course, Chesapeake wouldnt have invested that amount if executives werent convinced the resources could yield much more. In a financial report issued the day before the conference call, Chesapeake noted that officials believed the Utica shale play could add between $15 billion and $20 billion in value. Chesapeake is not the only party interested in Ohio shale. Clif Little, an Ohio State University extension educator in Guernsey and Noble counties, said more than 1,200 property owners have taken his leasing farmland for oil and gas classes this year. Drilling companies, small oil and gas companies, landowner associations and attorneys all are attempting to secure deep drilling rights, Little added. The $1 billion figure is an old figure, Little wrote in an email. The amount invested in the Utica and Marcellus would far exceed that number today, but I am no longer keeping track of investment figures. Although he might not have been right on the money, Skindell was very much in the ballpark with respect to Chesapeakes figures. If anything, he undersold the political point he was trying to make: that Ohio is on the cusp of a fracking boom. Skindells words were over a billion dollars worth of leases, and clearly that is the case.",1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,true

Final Rating: Mostly False  ",Californias Proposition 63 would CRIMINALIZE the sharing of ammunition between friends who may be hunting or shooting together.," Proposition 63, a gun and ammunition control initiative on Californias November ballot, would require instant background checks for the sale of ammunition statewide. Known as the Safety For All Initiative and proposed by Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom, the measure is considered a significant addition to Californias already strict gun regulations. The initiative is in some cases more stringent than gun control bills introduced by state Senate leader Kevin De León and recently signed into law by Gov. Jerry Brown. Recently, a gun rights group, the Firearms Policy Coalition, in a June 16 email blast claimed Proposition 63 would restrict not only ammo sales, but criminalize the sharing of bullets between hunting and shooting partners. The Sacramento-based coalition describes itself as a grassroots nonprofit dedicated to defending Second Amendment rights. We decided to examine the claim: Would Proposition 63 really criminalizes the sharing of bullets between friends? Our research We started by checking the text of the Proposition. It broadly restricts ammunition sales by requiring instant background checks and requiring, by January 2018, all sales be conducted or processed through a licensed ammunition vendor, according to Section 8 of the text. Law enforcement would be exempted. Currently, the state does not require a license or record keeping for ammunition sales, according to the San Francisco-based Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence. By contrast, the restrictions Proposition 63 places on sharing or transferring ammunition are not as strict. Still, they would change some aspects of the largely unregulated practice. The measure would: -- Make it illegal for an individual to share bullets with any person who he or she knows or using reasonable care should know is banned from owning or possessing ammunition; -- Make it illegal for someone to share bullets if they know they will be subsequently sold or transferred to a person banned from owning them; -- Require individuals meet face-to-face to transfer ammunition; The new crimes would be classified as a misdemeanors, punishable by up to one year in jail and a $1,000 fine, according to the measure. They are listed under proposed changes to Sections 30306 and 30312 of the California Penal Code. They could still freely transfer and share that ammunition with their hunting and shooting partners provided that they do so in person and do not have knowledge that the ammunition would subsequently be provided to a felon or other prohibited person, Dan Newman, spokesman for the Safety For All Initiative, wrote in an email. Representatives from the Firearms Policy Coalition did not respond to our requests for comment. An AK-47 rifle 30-round magazine is seen with 30 rounds of 7.62x39mm ammunition, in Alexandria, Va., Wednesday, Feb. 10, 2016. (AP Photo/Cliff Owen) Our ruling The Firearms Policy Coalition recently claimed Californias Proposition 63 would Criminalize the sharing of ammunition between friends who may be hunting or shooting together. The initiative would create some new restrictions on bullet sharing. It would be it illegal to knowingly share bullets with a felon; to share with any other person banned from owning them; or with anyone who would subsequently share them with a banned person. It would also require people meet face-to-face to transfer ammunition. Breaking the new rules would be considered a misdemeanor. The coalitions statement, however, gives the wrong and overly broad impression that friends on a hunting trip or at a shooting range could never legally share a bullet -- that somehow the measure would criminalize all aspects of sharing a box of bullets with your shooting partner. Instead, the vast majority of people could keep sharing, as long as they know or within reason should know theyre not sharing with a felon or another person prohibited from owning a gun and ammunition.

Final Rating: False",The Democrat-backed health care reform plan will require (Americans) to subsidize abortion with their hard-earned tax dollars.,"In an already contentious health care debate, the last thing the Obama administration wants is a fight over abortion. The word abortion was never mentioned in the initial health care plans released by the House and Senate. The decision of whether to offer abortion coverage in the proposed public plan, then, would be left up to the health and human services secretary. Abortion opponents said that would allow Democrats to slip abortion into the plan as part of the standard coverage. In an op-ed piece on July 23, House Republican Leader John Boehner of Ohio repeated the concerns of many who oppose abortion that the Democratic-backed health care reform plan will require (Americans) to subsidize abortion with their hard-earned tax dollars. Although there are several versions of the health care bill kicking around in Congress, one thing has now become clear: Most envision a government-run health plan option that could include abortion coverage, as well as a health care exchange in which participating private insurance companies would be permitted to offer such coverage. But does that mean that federal tax dollars would be used to subsidize abortions? That's a more difficult question. Let's back up a minute and explain some background: Currently, the 1976 Hyde Amendment prohibits the use of federal funds for abortions through Medicaid except in cases of rape, incest or when the mother's health is in peril. So states that want to offer abortion coverage have to pay for it themselves. Similar restrictions on public funding for abortions applies to federal health care coverage extended to active and retired military and federal employees. President Barack Obama gave a nod to that precedent when asked in a July 21 CBS interview with Katie Couric whether he favored a government option that would cover abortions. Obama said, As you know, I'm prochoice. But I think we also have a tradition of, in this town, historically, of not financing abortions as part of government-funded health care. Rather than wade into that issue at this point, I think that it's appropriate for us to figure out how to just deliver on the cost savings, and not get distracted by the abortion debate at this station. Abortion opponents had hoped similar restrictions to those in the Hyde Amendment would be placed on any government-run health care option, and also be extended to any private insurance companies that participate in the government-sponsored health care exchange, which will provide health insurance for people who don't get it through their employer. To that end, Rep. Bart Stupak, D-Mich., offered an amendment to the House health care proposal that would prohibit the use of public money to cover any part of the costs of any health plan that includes coverage of abortion. The amendment was narrowly defeated. Donna Crane, policy director for NARAL Pro-Choice America, called Stupak's proposal a radical departure from the status quo, because millions of women who currently have private insurance plans that cover abortions would be stripped of that coverage if their plan ultimately became part of the exchange — which seems likely. According to a 2002 Guttmacher Institute study, 87 percent of employment-based insured health plans offered coverage for abortions (though not all companies select it for their employees). A 2003 Kaiser Family Foundation survey found that 46 percent of covered workers had coverage for abortions. The two surveys asked different questions, but the bottom line is that a significant percentage of women currently have health insurance that covers abortions. And so began the debate over how to make the health care reform bill abortion neutral. A compromise plan offered by Rep. Lois Capps, D-Calif., which passed the House Energy and Commerce Committee, seeks to alleviate many of the concerns expressed by abortion opponents — particularly the issue of tax dollars being used to subsidize abortions — while specifically making abortion coverage available in both the public plan and in private plans participating in the exchange. Under the Capps amendment: • Abortion coverage would not be part of the required minimum benefits package. In other words, insurers would not be required to offer, or be prohibited from offering, abortion services in order to participate in the exchange. • The public plan could include abortion coverage, but the cost of the additional coverage could not be paid through public subsidies (tax dollars), only through the premiums paid by the insured. And with private plans in the exchange, again, federal subsidies could not be used for abortion coverage. • Public funding would only be permitted for abortions allowed under the Hyde Amendment — in cases of rape, incest or when the mother's life is in danger. • At least one plan in every region must offer full abortion coverage; and one must not. • Any insurance plan participating in the exchange cannot discriminate against hospitals or other health care facilities (such as Catholic hospitals) that are unwilling to provide abortions. • The plan will not pre-empt any state laws regarding abortion, such as parental notification laws. Douglas Johnson, legislative director for National Right to Life, said the amendment is hardly a compromise, and the pledge not to prohibit the use of public funds amounts to little more than symbolic bookkeeping. The Capps amendment may claim to segregate funds used for abortions, he said, but the bottom line is you have the government paying subsidies to people who are then able to obtain abortion coverage. And, he said, It's still the government running the whole plan. The government would be participating in the killing of unborn children under the guise of a health care plan, Johnson said. But that's not the opinion of all antiabortion groups. Chris Korzen, executive director of Catholics United, which opposes abortion, said his group doesn't want to see an important health care plan derailed by a misleading campaign that claims the health care plan would mean taxpayer-subsidized abortions. The goal should be to maintain the current policies, Korzen said. That Capps amendment accomplishes just that. It specifically prohibits taxpayers' funding of abortions. It disappoints me that there are people who are still making that claim. And, he said, there's a lot to be happy about, including the fact that abortion coverage was not included as part of the required minimum benefits package. Crane said NARAL believes abortion should be treated like any other health service. But they think the Capps amendment at least maintains the status quo, and that it helped to alleviate many of the concerns expressed by abortion opponents. We thought they got everything they wanted, Crane said. We are confused why they continue to push. Obviously, there's a lot at stake in the health care bill for both sides in the abortion debate. The fact that several versions of the health care reform bill are floating around Congress makes it difficult to say with certainty what the final plan will or will not include. But while it appears likely the plan would allow for the coverage of abortions, we don't see anything in the plans that would require taxpayers to foot the bill for that. In fact, in a key version of the bill — the one passed by the House Energy and Commerce Committee — members went to great pains to include an amendment to ensure that federal money is not used for abortion coverage. Again, things could change as the health reform package works its way through Congress, but for now, we don't see anything to support Boehner's claim that taxpayers would subsidize abortions. And so we rule his statement False.",0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,false

Final Rating: False  ",Says a bill co-sponsored by Sen. Claire McCaskill would give a free pass to any illegal immigrant who brings a child to the border.,"Missouri Attorney General Josh Hawley and outside groups supporting his campaign have criticized Sen. Claire McCaskill for her views on immigration during their Senate race. A recent salvo in this subtext of their contest comes from Hawley in the form of an op-ed for FoxNews.com.  now she (McCaskill) is sponsoring the most radical open-border bill ever introduced in Congress, Hawley wrote. Her bill was written by California liberal Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein, and it would give a free pass to any illegal immigrant who brings a child to the border. Hawley is referring to the Keep Families Together Act, which would bar family separations except if the child is at risk of trafficking and abuse by parents or guardians. Kelli Ford, the Hawley campaigns press secretary, said that Hawleys free pass comments meant that if you are an immigrant coming here illegally with a child, this bill would let you enter into the United States. With immigration becoming a wedge issue between McCaskill and Hawley, we spoke to experts and consulted the text of the bill to determine the accuracy of Hawleys assertion. Ford pointed to the language of the bill from Section 2(a), which, in her words, tells agents/officers that they cant remove a child from a parent/legal guardian within the 100-mile limit of the United States. Thats true — with exceptions. Border officials could separate if the child is a victim of trafficking or at significant risk of it; if there's a strong likelihood that the adult is not the parent; or if the child is in danger of abuse or neglect. State courts and state or county child welfare agencies can also separate families if it's in the child's best interest. Finally, Ford pointed to an excerpt from the bill that says children cant be removed from guardians solely for the policy goal of deterring individuals from migrating to the United States or for the policy goal of promoting compliance with civil immigration laws. Hawleys depiction of the Keeping Families Together Act is incorrect, experts said. The bill would not grant illegal immigrants a pass — free or otherwise — to enter or live legally or illegally in the United States, David Bier, an immigration policy analyst at the libertarian Cato Institute think tank wrote in an email. It would only prohibit the separation of children from their parents who come to the border unless the child is a victim of trafficking or abuse. Bier went on to write that the bill does not forbid the removal of parents who are undocumented immigrants from the U.S., meaning it does not change existing immigration law, nor does it seek to make it easier for such parents or guardians to stay in the U.S. Leon Fresco, an immigration attorney based in Washington, D.C., put his objections to Hawleys claim simply: Nothing in this bill prevents the removal of a family unit in its entirety. The bill does not block families from being detained together, said Fresco, aformer deputy assistant attorney general who drafted the Senates comprehensive immigration reform bill in 2013. While Fresco understands the reasoning behind thinking its wrong to prevent the government from prosecuting an adult for crossing the border illegally if they bring their child, that is not what this proposed law would do. It only prevents the separation of the adult and the child, Fresco wrote. The bill does not put forth safeguards for immigrants without documentation; adults can still be prosecuted. Matt Barreto, UCLA professor of political science and Chicana/o studies, was adamant in his disagreement with Hawleys conclusion about the bill: It absolutely does not do that. It just blocks DHS/CBP from taking children away from their parents, Barreto wrote in an email. People still have to go through all the normal procedures for asylum, refugee or immigration. The Hawley campaign pointed out that Barretos firm Latino Decisions did polling work for the Hillary Clinton campaign. Hawley said McCaskill backed a bill that would give a free pass to any illegal immigrant who brings a child to the border. The bill in question takes no such measure. Undocumented immigrants are not afforded any new protections from prosecution under the bill; it seeks to stop the separation of immigrant children from their families or guardians. The thinking behind Hawleys charge against McCaskill has been echoed by Republican officials throughout the country. That doesnt make it more right. Update, Oct. 6, 11:30p.m.: The article has been updated to add context to two sources, Leon Fresco and Matt Barreto.",0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,false

Walker.,"Introducing President Barack Obama in Milwaukee, Democratic gubernatorial hopeful Mary Burke touted economic growth nationwide when compared to that in Wisconsin under Gov. Scott Walker: The nation as a whole has created jobs at a rate that is two times the rate that we have created jobs here in Wisconsin under Gov. Walker. Asked to back up the claim, the Burke campaign pointed us to data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics quarterly employment surveys. That data is considered the most reliable measure of jobs, though it is less timely than that from separate monthly employment surveys. The campaign told us the statistics show U.S. growth at nearly twice the rate of Wisconsin. Burke, though, was more definitive at the rally, saying two times the rate. Burkes phrasing of the talking point has changed. In early 2014, she said the latest data from the quarterly surveys showed the national rate was nearly double Wisconsins rate. At that point, she quoted a Milwaukee Journal Sentinel story that came to the same conclusion after Wisconsin reported 1 percent growth compared with 1.9% nationally from June 2012 to June 2013. At the time, that was the latest available data, due to the lag time in the release of the detailed quarterly numbers, We crunched the same numbers the Burke campaign cited, examining private-sector employment, which has been the central focus of both candidates plans. Figures show that from the start of Walkers term to the end of his third year, the national gain was 6.6 percent compared to Wisconsins 4.1 percent. That meant the U.S. growth was 1.6 times that of Wisconsins. In the most recent year (March 2013 to March 2014), Wisconsins growth rate was 1.3 percent, compared with the U.S. rate of 2.1 percent. Same result: the national rate was 1.6 times better. As we examined year-over-year growth at different quarterly vantage points, we repeatedly saw growth 1.6 to 1.7 times larger for the national figures. (We also looked at results from another government jobs survey, the monthly reports. They are more up to date -- through September 2014 -- but less reliable. They, too, show, national growth at 1.6 times the states, from the start of Walkers term.) There were some smaller and larger differences at various points along the way. Annual growth rates in the United States in 2011, 2012 and 2013, and into early 2014 ranged from 1.2 to 2 times larger than Wisconsins. The high point was from September 2011 to September 2012, when the rate was twice that of Wisconsin. Our rating Burke claimed that the nation as a whole has created jobs at a rate that is two times the rate that we have created jobs here in Wisconsin under Gov. Walker. Wisconsin lags behind the nation significantly, but for the most part quite not as badly as Burke says, based on the last year and on results from most of Walkers term.",0.5,0.5,1.0,0.5,0.0,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,half-true

Final Rating: Half True  ","Says the average Ohio student graduates from a four-year college or university with nearly $27,000 in tuition debt.","Editor's note: We originally rated this claim True. After receiving feedback from readers, we have downgraded that rating to Half True because the claim applies the average debt of about $27,000 to a much broader group than did the study from which it was cited. Interest rates on federally subsidized student loans went on the front burner as a political issue after Mitt Romney followed President Obama in saying he did not want those rates to go up. Congressional Republicans -- who earlier passed a budget allowing the rates to double in July to their 2007 rate of 6.8 percent -- closed ranks behind their presumptive presidential nominee.They voted for a hastily introduced bill that would keep the rate at 3.4 percent, and pay for it with funds intended for preventive health care programs under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.Raiding that fund made the legislation unpalatable for Democrats -- just as the Democratic proposals to extend the lower interest rates were unpalatable to Republicans.One of the proposals would have paid for the college loan subsidies by ending tax subsidies for oil and gas companies. Another would end a payroll tax exemption given some business owners.Ohio's Sen. Sherrod Brown was a co-sponsor of the latter bill and of earlier legislation to stop the loan rates from going up.Federally-subsidized Stafford loans have allowed thousands of students—who might not otherwise be able pay for to college—afford the ever-increasing cost of higher education, he said in a news release. With the average Ohio student graduating from a four-year institution with nearly $27,000 in tuition bills, the last thing we should be doing is adding to their already-heavy debt load.The figure of $27,000 caught the notice of PolitiFact Ohio. It is more than $6,700 per year for four years of school.We asked Brown's office for his source and more information. They referred us to the Project on Student Debt, a project of the independent, nonprofit Institute for College Access and Success.Its most recent survey of public and private four-year institutions in Ohio found that 68 percent of students graduate in debt, and that the average debt on college loans is $27,713 -- the 7th-highest statewide average in the nation. (New Hampshire was highest, with average debt of $31,048; Wyoming was lowest, with $20,571.)The actual debt level is probably higher, the Project on Student Debt noted, because the data is voluntarily reported by colleges and not available for all of them.The report also reflects only graduates of public and private nonprofit colleges because few for-profit colleges report the student debt data. Based on national surveys by the U.S. Department of Education, graduates of for-profit four-year colleges are much more likely to borrow student loans, and borrow significantly more, than counterparts at nonprofit institutions.Nationally, according to a report from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, the average student loan balance per borrower is $23,300. The median balance is roughly half of that, $12,800. About one-quarter of borrowers nationally owe more than $28,000, and about 10 percent owe more than $54,000, according to the New York Fed.In aggregate, the bank said, the outstanding student loan balance now stands at about $870 billion, surpassing the nations total credit card balance ($693 billion) and the total auto loan balance ($730 billion). About 37 million people hold outstanding student loan debt.The key with all these figures is that they deal specifically with students who borrow and then graduate with loan debt.So how does that mesh with Browns claim? In his statement he said the average Ohio student graduating from a four-year institution. That describes a bigger pool of people than just the students who graduate with debt. In that most recent survey it would also include the 32 percent of the graduates who had no debt. But the figure Brown cited, nearly $27,000, was an average covering just those students who graduated with debt.Browns statement is partially accurate. He cites the correct figure from a survey on debt among college students. But he describes those affected by debt too broadly, applying the average to all rather than just those who graduate with loan balances. Including all students would lower the average for loan debt by about a third. Thats an important detail needed to fully understand Browns claim.On the Truth-O-Meter, Browns statement rates as Half True.",0.6,0.6,1.0,0.7,0.0,0.2,0.5,1.0,0.5,half-true

Final Rating: Half True","Says Kansas U.S. House candidate Paul Davis was caught with a stripper during a drug raid and later voted to allow strip clubs to open near homes, churches, schools and daycare facilities.","A new ad from the Congressional Leadership Fund, a super PAC working to protect the GOP Majority in the U.S. House, attacks a Kansas congressional hopeful for an incident at a strip club 20 years ago. You bet we wanted to see if the facts here stood up to scrutiny. Democrat Paul Davis is locked in a competitive race with Republican Steve Watkins in Kansas 2nd Congressional District, a seat that includes Topeka, Lawrence and the communities west of Kansas City. The ad targets Davis for his alleged involvement in a 1998 strip club drug raid, where he was found in a dark room with a nearly naked woman. Whats worse than getting caught at a strip club during a drug bust? Ask Paul Davis. The ad then claims Davis was found in a VIP room with a woman wearing only a G-string.Then it says, Even worse, after Davis was caught with a stripper, he voted to allow strip clubs to open near our homes, churches, schools and even daycare facilities. Shady Paul Davis cant be trusted. Here, we are checking the details surrounding the strip club incident, along with the claim that Davis voted to allow strip clubs to operate near places like schools, homes, churches and daycares. The situation involving Davis and a strip club came to light in September 2014 during his bid for governor, which he lost. According to reports, Davis was getting a lap dance in a back room in the late 1990s when cops raided the club in search of drugs. He was not charged with a crime, but police involved in the raid reported he was found in a compromising position. Davis said he was at the wrong place at the wrong time. Independence Police Chief Harry Smith later corroborated Davis account that the candidate was not involved in any wrongdoing, or, to his knowledge, the focus of an investigation. He said Davis was questioned briefly before being released. Kelsi Browning, a spokeswoman for Davis campaign, told PolitiFact that the ad is based on something that happened 20 years ago when Davis was 26. As a new lawyer, she said, Daviswent with his boss to meet an unsavory client of the law firm. The ad refers to HB 2107, or the Community Defense Act, which was a 2011 state bill that would have prohibited strip clubs and other sexually oriented businesses from being established within 1,000 feet of the property line of an existing one as well as any schools, churches, public parks, residences, libraries or daycare centers. The bill would have also required semi-nude dancers to remain at least 6 feet away from their customers and for sexually oriented businesses to remain closed from midnight to 6 a.m. Davis was one of 28 Kansas House members who voted against the bill, which ultimately failed in the Senate. The Davis campaign says that the legislation was a perennial bill thatrarely made it out of committee. When it first came up in 2010, Davis actually voted for the bill before it was struck down in the Senate. It came up again in the 2011 session, but this time, he voted against it. Critics of the legislation, which included Davis, argued at the time that regulating these businesses was best left to cities and counties. Some also questioned taking the time to focus on the issue when the state was facing a massive budget deficit. In a Lawrence Journal-World story around the time of the vote, Davis, who was the House minority leader, was quoted saying that the Legislature was probably intruding in areas where we dont need to be. Weve got a lot more important things that we need to be dealing with here. The Congressional Leadership Fund ad says that Kansas U.S. House candidate Paul Davis was caught with a stripper during a drug raid and later voted to allow strip clubs to open near homes, churches, schools and daycares. The ad is piecing together two unrelated issues to draw an unsavory conclusion, while embellishing parts of the story. Davis did not vote to allow strip clubs to open near schools, churches, daycares and the like. He once voted against a measure that would have banned them from opening near these places. He also once voted for the same proposal. The ads claim that he was found in a strip club during a drug raid is accurate, but any suggestion he was connected to the drug raid is misplaced. Overall, this claim is partially accurate but takes things out of context.",0.5,0.8,0.9,0.6,0.7,0.8,0.5,0.8,0.6,half-true

Final Rating: Half True  ","Cuts in local government and school funding in John Kasichs budget caused many communities to seek school levies, local tax increases, layoffs.","After a recent appearance on NBC's Meet the Press in which Gov. John Kasich said he had balanced Ohio's budget and cut taxes, the Ohio Democratic Party issued a statement that his budget had negative consequences for local communities.Kasich slashed local government and school funding to the bone, the statement said, causing many communities to seek school levies, local tax increases, layoffs to offset budget cuts.PolitiFact Ohio decided to check out the claim.The governor's office answered with its own statement. It said the number of local government workers in Ohio has increased under Kasich after decreasing under his Democratic predecessor, Ted Strickland, and that the number of local tax issues has declined.PolitiFact Ohio was intrigued. Kasich and other Republicans often talk about shrinking the size of government. We found he was accurate, three months ago, when he said the number of state workers in Ohio had gone down.So it was something like a man bites dog story for him to boast that local government employment increased on his watch after declining under a Democratic administration.Kasich's spokesman referred us to the employment database of the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics.It showed that the number of local government workers in Ohio in July 2011, when the Kasich budget went into effect, was 520,600. It was 526,200 in preliminary numbers for May, the most recent number available -- an increase of 5,600 workers.The number stood at 554,700 in July 2007, when the first Strickland budget went into effect, and 523,400 in June 2011 -- a decrease of 31,300.The decrease continued until last January, when it reached 520,000, the lowest level since 1999. The peak of local government employment in Ohio was 560,600, reached in July 2004, according to the BLS.Kasich spokesman Rob Nichols also pointed to the local election tallies on the Ohio secretary of state website. The figures show tax issues were at the lowest levels since 2003, he said, countering the claim that Kasich's budget led to local tax increases.We looked, though we find it difficult to draw any conclusions about local finances from a simple count of the number of tax issues on local ballots. For consistency of comparison, we looked at November general-election tallies. (There has been one November general election and one spring primary since Kasich's budget went into effect.)What we found was a general consistency in the number of tax issues: a total of 1,009 last November; 1,059 in November 2010; 1,100 in November 2009; 1,053 in November 2008, and 995 in 2007 -- the lowest level in the years for which a local issues summary was available.Kasich's two-year budget, signed a year ago, cut state funding for local governments by about $630 million over the two years, and cut funding for schools by about $700 million. The governor challenged local governments to be more efficient and creative to deal with the cuts without raising taxes.Ohio Democratic Party Spokesman Jerid Kurtz cited 10 municipalities and school districts looking at layoffs and tax hikes that officials blamed on the funding cuts.One was the city of Lima. Its finance director said it had a balanced budget as recently as 2008, but faced a $2 million deficit in its general fund, largely because of state budget cuts, despite reducing the general fund consistently for the past 10 years, the Lima News reported.Another was Sycamore Township, near Cincinnati. It laid off most of its firefighters in May 2012 because, township officials said, state budget cuts would eliminate half of the community's general fund revenue.A third was the Berea school district, which passed a 3.9-mill operating levy in March 2012 after reducing its budget by $5.1 million for reasons that included the loss of state dollars.According to the Ohio School Boards Association, school levies passed in March 2012 at an exceptionally high rate of 74 percent, the highest level since November 2000. The usual passage rate for school levies in Ohio is about 54 percent, the group said.The growth in local government employment is more likely due to the Ohio recovery that began a full year before Kasich took office, Kurtz said. There is absolutely no proof Kasich's budget is the cause.Seeking further perspective, we called the Ohio Municipal League, which lobbies for cities and villages. Communications director Kent Scarrett said he certainly agreed there is more of an uptick in school levies because of state funding cuts, and said the full impact has not yet been felt.The biggest cuts in direct payments to municipalities through the Local Government Fund will come in year two of Kasich's budget in 2013. The elimination of the estate tax in 2013, which is also part of the budget, will further reduce revenue to local governments.They're going to be up against it next year, Scarrett said. In 2013 the cuts are going to be much more profound. It's kind of scary.That's looking into the future, which we won't do.Let's get back to the statement we're checking: Kasich slashed local government and school funding to the bone, causing many communities to seek tax increases and lay off workers.The claim is partially accurate.Kasich's budget did cut funding for local governments significantly. Some school districts and municipalities have sought, considered or passed tax issues to deal with budget shortfalls to which the funding cuts have contributed. And the Ohio Democrats can provide anecdotal evidence that some budget shortfalls have threatened or led to layoffs.But the claim also overlooks important details that give the it context.The number of local government jobs in Ohio has actually increased since Kasich's budget was enacted, after dipping to a 12-year low. And the number of local tax issues to appear on ballots across Ohio has been steady for several years.Further, one of the outside experts we talked to says it is too soon to tell the full impact of cuts in funding because the biggest cuts through the Local Government Fund havent kicked in yet, nor has the elimination of the estate tax.On the Truth-O-Meter, the claim rates Half True.",0.5,0.5,1.0,0.5,0.0,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,half-true

Final Rating: Half True  ","Savings that I achieved helped fund cameras on the border. As a result, more than 21,500 arrests have been made and 46 tons of narcotics confiscated.","Lieutenant governor candidate Todd Staples says he not only has a plan that addresses border security, hes already tackled the challenge. Staples, Texas agriculture commissioner, wrote in a Jan. 13, 2014, campaign email blast, Using cost savings that I achieved from cutting government waste, I helped fund Operation Drawbridge, a low-cost, high-tech, DPS-led operation that placed game cameras along the border to detect illegal trafficking. As a result, more than 21,500 arrests have been made and 46 tons of narcotics confiscated. The Texas Department of Agriculture indeed approved aid for Operation Drawbridge, we learned, but the multimillion-dollar Department of Public Safety project had already been in place for most of a year. Also, Staples cited arrest and confiscation totals reflected Drawbridges overall results. In an interview, Staples told us his statement was intended to reflect totals for the entire program and hes never said all the results were due to Agriculture Department aid. Staples also stressed that his email blast said the agencys savings helped achieve the results. I dont want to get popped for something Ive never taken credit for, he said. Operation Drawbridge The states Department of Public Safety started Drawbridge in January 2012, according to its website. DPS spokesman Tom Vinger told us by email that Agriculture Department grants in October 2012 and August 2013 provided $345,000 to the program. The main source of Drawbridge funding, Vinger said, is the Criminal Justice Division of the Governors Office, which has so far provided grants totaling $2.5 million. A description of the initiative from a June 9, 2012, San Antonio Express-News news story said, (T)he department is installing 500 cameras along the border, part of an electronic monitoring program called Operation Drawbridge. It's an update of the much-criticized Texas Border Watch Program, a multimillion-dollar effort by the state to set up video cameras along the border. It was recently canceled after only a few dozen cameras were put in place over more than three years and unimpressive results. A 2013 DPS conference presentation placed online illustrates how Drawbridge uses modified off-the-shelf, motion-sensing, low-light cameras of the type hunters use to spot and track game at all hours. Farmers and ranchers volunteer to have the $300 cameras placed on their land near the Texas/Mexico border. Once an image is captured, software transmits it to law enforcement, and response times can be as quick as 10 minutes, according to the presentation.   Images from 2013 conference presentation on DPS website preparingtexas.org  Staples has long warned that because of a lack of border security, farmers and ranchers are under siege. His campaign spokesman, Bryan Black, told us via email that Staples helped bring landowner organizations into Operation Drawbridge. Staples told us his involvement with border security issues arose in response to landowners asking him for help. Savings to buy cameras Black said the grants came from agency savings in fiscal year 2013. Agriculture Department spokeswoman Lindsey Pope emailed us a chart with the agencys lapsed appropriations, money budgeted by lawmakers but ultimately unspent, in each biennium from 2006-07 through 2012-13. It showed the total returned to the state treasury in 2012-13 was $10.3 million. DPS spokesman Vinger sent us web links to his agencys Oct. 11, 2012, press release on the $225,000 grant and Aug. 8, 2013, release on the $120,000 grant. The 2012 release said, Operation Drawbridge is fully operational today with hundreds of cameras located along the border. This funding will essentially double the number of cameras involved in the program. Drawbridge was operating 750 cameras as of June 30, 2013, according to the online DPS presentation. Legislative Budget Board staff spokesman John Barton emailed us a Sept. 28, 2012, grant agreement between the agencies stating that the $225,000 grant was for the funding of additional DPS remote motion-sensing cameras, installation and monitoring activities associated with the surveillance along the border, particularly in those areas of the Texas-Mexico border where illegal activity and border violence have adversely affected rural landowners and the Texas agriculture industry. An Aug. 8, 2013, McAllen Monitor news story said, The $120,000 grant is for DPS to expand the program by purchasing more motion-sensing cameras. Arrests and confiscations From January 2012 through December 2013, according to Vinger and the DPS website, Drawbridge resulted in the apprehension of more than 22,950 individuals and more than 50 tons of narcotics. The October 2012 press release announcing the first Department of Agriculture grant said Drawbridge had resulted in the apprehension of approximately 4,000 individuals and 10 tons of narcotics since January 2012. So it would appear that at least 18,950 people and 40 tons of narcotics were captured from Oct. 11, 2012, through Dec. 31, 2013. Some supporting detail comes from the 2013 DPS conference presentation:   Our ruling Staples said savings he achieved helped fund cameras on the border and that as a result, more than 21,500 arrests were made and 46 tons of narcotics were confiscated. This statement could leave the misleading impression that a few hundred thousand dollars committed on Staples watch to an established program near the border culminated in the touted arrests and confiscations. Its documented that the grant money supported the border effort. But we dont see a way to tie particular arrests and confiscations to the grants. Also, this statement leaves out the critical fact that about 90 percent of the operations funding has come from federal aid awarded through the governors office.

Final Rating: Half True",You're more likely to be the victim of a violent crime in Milwaukee than in 96 percent of the country.,"Resentment and recrimination often characterize political relations between Milwaukee and the rest of Wisconsin. In the latest clash, the Milwaukee Public Schools board thwarted an effort by Republican state lawmakers to reform the low-performing district. That led the GOP leader of the Senate to say the Legislature might respond by cutting the districts funding. About two weeks later, on July 10, 2016, another GOP lawmaker issued a broadside against largely Democratic Milwaukee. State Sen. Van Wanggaard of Racine wrote an opinion piece in the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel that was laden with statistical claims unfavorable to the city -- including one making a national comparison about crime that we want to check. Recent complaints from Milwaukee leaders about their lack of state funding are misguided and lack perspective, the column began. Unfortunately, Wanggaard later wrote, the only way to cut this expenditure is to reduce the number of people needing assistance — reducing poverty. But the failing school system and Milwaukee's crime problem prevent that. Then came the claim were interested in, with Wanggaard saying you're more likely to be the victim of a violent crime in Milwaukee than in 96 percent of the country. Milwaukee is known for a relatively high violent crime rate. But this way of expressing that has some problems. Trends in violent crime Across the country, crime has been on a downward trend. Thats what PolitiFact National reported in June 2016 in rating as Pants on Fire Donald Trumps claim that crime is rising. With regard to violent crime, our colleagues checked FBI figures through 2014, the latest year for which complete figures are available. They found that nationally, the rates of violent crime per 100,000 people have been falling on an almost uninterrupted basis since the early 1990s. As counted by the FBIs Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR), violent crime includes murder, rape, robbery and aggravated assault. Milwaukees violent crime rate has been among the highest among large cities. In 2014, there were 8,864 violent crimes reported in the city, according to the FBI figures. That was up 8 percent from 8,194 in 2013. Now, to Wanggaards claim. Wanggaards evidence To back the statement, Wanggaards staff cited rankings from two websites that rank places to live. Each used the FBIs UCR violent crime figures for 2014. AreaVibes.com says Milwaukee is safer than 4 percent of the cities in the United States. Another way to say that would be that Milwaukees violent crime rate is higher than 96 percent of the country. NeighborhoodScout.com says the figure is 3 percent. Michael OHear, a law professor at Marquette University in Milwaukee, told us the rankings give some basis for Wanggaards 96 percent claim. But OHear and other criminal justice experts told us there are problems with the claim. Its sort of a dubious measure on so many grounds, said Alfred Blumstein, an emeritus professor of urban systems and operations research Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh. Comparison problems 1. UCR figures are solid. But the FBI strongly discourages using them to make rankings to evaluate different communities, saying: These incomplete analyses have often created misleading perceptions which adversely affect geographic entities and their residents. For this reason, the FBI has a long-standing policy against ranking participating law enforcement agencies on the basis of crime data alone  many factors cause the nature and type of crime to vary from place to place. 2. Across the country, violent crime generally is concentrated in larger cities, so it stands to reason there is less violent crime in most parts of the country. But the figures used in the website rankings compare Milwaukee with cities such as Mount Pleasant near Racine (15 violent crimes in 2014)and Sun Prairie (32) near Madison that have a population as low as 25,000. Theres a world of difference between a city of 25,000 and a city the size of Milwaukee (population 600,000), OHear said. 3. Violent crime in Milwaukee is concentrated in certain neighborhoods, while other neighborhoods carry no more risk of violent crime than many suburban neighborhoods. In other words, youre not suddenly at great risk of being a violent crime victim simply by crossing the city limits. Usually if youre not hanging out in high-crime neighborhoods, your chances of being a victim of crime are pretty low, said Michael Jacobson, executive director of the City University of New York Institute for State & Local Governance. Our rating Wanggaard said: You're more likely to be the victim of a violent crime in Milwaukee than in 96 percent of the country. Three rankings using violent crime rates from the FBI give Milwaukee such a ranking. But the FBI warns against using its figures to do rankings; the rankings compare Milwaukee to relatively tiny cities; and the claim makes a broad claim about Milwaukee but ignores the fact that most violent crime in the city is limited to certain neighborhoods.

But the post exaggerates when it says the race had the power to change the Supreme Court. The post was flagged as part of Facebooks efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Two ads by Bloombergs Independence USA PAC praised Toomey for crossing party lines to support background checks for gun buyers. Toomey backed legislation to expand checks to online sales and gun shows — a position shared by Bloomberg, who helped launch the gun control advocacy group Everytown for Gun Safety. A New York Times analysis of Bloombergs donations stated that he spent $11.7 million to support Toomey in 2016. Since 2012, the New York Times found, Bloomberg has helped candidates from both major parties, but his political committees have given more to Democrats than Republicans. We used the database of donations posted by the Center for Responsive Politics and found that Bloombergs Independence USA PAC spent $5.9 million in support of Toomey in 2016. As an individual, Bloomberg gave $2,700 to Toomeys campaign. The Pennsylvania U.S. Senate race was the most expensive general-election Senate contest in the nation in 2016, reaching a total of $170 million with candidate and outside spending combined. The Facebook post misleads when it states, if McGinty had won, Ds would have controlled the Senate after Doug Jones won. At the beginning of 115th Congress in January 2017, there were 52 Republicans, 46 Democrats and 2 independents who caucused with the Democrats. When Alabama Democrat Doug Jones took office in January 2018, that gave Republicans a 51-49 lead. If McGinty had won, the Senate would have ended up at 50-50. So who would have been in control? Washington University political scientist Steve Smith said that there are Senate precedents that allow the vice presidents party — in this case Mike Pence — to be treated as the majority party. When the 2000 elections produced a 50-50 tie and a Republican vice president, the two parties worked out a power-sharing agreement that provided for committees to be equally divided between the parties but with Republican chairs, Smith said. However the majority leader was the Republican leader. If the Senate found itself in another 50-50 split, that would lead to another round of negotiations. The Democrats would not control the Senate in the case of a 50-50 division, he said. To the contrary, some power sharing arrangement would again be negotiated and the term control, an informal term, really would not fit. If the vice president was Republican, the majority leader would be Republican. Now that brings us to the part of the Facebook post that said after Jones won, if McGinty had also won, the Democrats could have blocked Kavanaugh from the Supreme Court. This statement does have a qualifier of could, but if it assumes that a McGinty win alone could have changed the outcome. Thats misleading. The Senate voted 50-48 to confirm Kavanaugh in October 2018. U.S. Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia was the lone Democrat to vote in favor. If we take the hypothetical scenario of McGinty beating Toomey, and assume she would have followed Democratic Party lines, and all other senators would have voted in the same way as they actually did, the vote would have tied 49-49. That means that Pence could have cast a deciding vote. Other scenarios are equally hypothetical. A Facebook post said, Fact: Mike Bloomberg spent $12 million to re-elect a Senate Republican (Toomey) in 2016. Toomey beat a Dem (McGinty) by 1.5 points. If McGinty had won, Ds would have controlled the Senate after Doug Jones won and could have blocked Kavanaugh from the Supreme Court. Bloomberg did support Toomey and gave him significant funding. The rest of the claim is murky and relies on a hypothetical situation. Kavanaugh was confirmed in a 50-48 vote. If McGinty had won and all other things were the same, it likely would have ended up in a tie vote to be broken by Pence.",0.5,0.6,0.8,0.6,0.4,0.5,0.5,0.7,0.5,half-true

Final Rating: Half True  ",Says Newt Gingrich is responsible for the gridlocked politics of Washington.,"During an interview on the Dec. 5, 2011, edition of MSNBCs The Daily Rundown, David Axelrod, a senior campaign adviser to President Barack Obama, coined a new description for Republican presidential candidate and former House Speaker Newt Gingrich: the godfather of gridlock.Discussing a newly released Gingrich ad that portrays the former speaker in a soft light, Axelrod told host Chuck Todd that he was amused by the ad because he talked about (how) he was going to bring the country together to solve problems. You're talking about the godfather of gridlock here, the guy who two decades ago really invented the kind of tactics that have now become commonplace in Washington. So, this is a whole new Newt.We wondered whether it was really fair to pin todays policy gridlock on tactics engineered by Gingrich. So we sought comments from historians, political scientists and other political observers. We thought analyzing this quote might prove too subjective, but we found concrete evidence to both bolster and undermine Axelrod's claim. Gingrich the fighter Some historians and analysts say Gingrich's bare-knuckled tactics created a sharp partisanship that continues today.Gingrich came to national attention when he led a group of fellow backbenchers to challenge the ethics of House Speaker Jim Wright, D-Texas. Their challenge led Wright to resign in 1989, driving the ousted speaker to decry the mindless cannibalism consuming Congress.It was a watershed moment for Gingrich, and only solidified his belief that confrontation, not compromise, was what Congress needed.Beginning in 1989, Gingrich bided his time as House minority whip, serving under a more conciliatory Republican leader, Bob Michel of Illinois. By 1993 and 1994, -- when a Democratic president, Bill Clinton, was in the White House and the 40-year Democratic House majority was looking shaky -- Gingrich upped the ante.The Republican strategy in 1993 and 1994 was to vote as a parliamentary minority, in unison against the new president's initiatives, and that was as much or more Newt's idea as anybody's, said Norm Ornstein, a congressional scholar with the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank. Clinton's economic program, his first big initiative, took almost eight months to pass, denying him a big early victory and making the eventual passage look like a humiliation. The same approach had success with a crime bill and, of course, with health care reform.Michels impending retirement cleared the way for Gingrich to become speaker if the GOP managed to take over the House in the 1994 election. And they did.Once in office, Gingrich continued his confrontational strategy, most notably in the budget fights of 1995 that led to shutdowns of the federal government. Purdue University political scientist Bert A. Rockman cited Gingrich's defamatory misuse of the C-SPAN morning one-minute diatribes to an empty chamber, his over-the-top-rhetoric and his dogged pursuit of Clintons impeachment. Its become much worse, and for reasons hardly exclusive to any individuals nastiness, but Newt was a major contributor to the nastiness that prevails today.Gingrich developed wedge issues to divide the Democratic majority and magnets to pull voters into the Republican orbit, said Steve Gillon, a historian at the University of Oklahoma and author of The Pact: Bill Clinton, Newt Gingrich, and the Rivalry that Defined a Generation.University of Kansas political scientist Burdett Loomis argues that Gingrichs attacks on Congress itself have harmed the institution in the long term. Though Gingrich is a historian by training, Loomis said, he ignored the importance of maintaining (Congress) legitimacy, which has haunted us since.Gingrich the deal-makerBut Loomis and others also say Gingrich's legacy is not black and white. After Gingrich lost the public relations war over the shutdown to Clinton, he became more willing to compromise with his rival.What Axelrod's comment does not account for is the change that took place in Gingrich after the 1995 budget battle, Gillon said. Both Clinton and Gingrich realized they had more to gain by working together than they did by fighting each other. Both men saw their poll numbers rise.This period of cooperation lasted until the emergence of the Monica Lewinsky affair in 1998, which Gingrich played a significant role in promoting.So what did Clinton and Gingrich accomplish during this era of (relatively) good feelings? Here are a few notable bills, each of which passed with broad, bipartisan majorities.Telecommunications Act, 1996 -- described by the Federal Communications Commission as the first major overhaul of telecommunications law in almost 62 years. The House passed the final version of the bill by a 414-16 margin, with 236 Republicans and 178 Democrats supporting it.Welfare reform, 1996 -- a landmark bill to end cash payments and instead encourage recipients to find work. The House passed the final version of the bill by a 328-101 margin, with 230 Republicans and 98 Democrats.Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, 1996 -- a law that allowed people to change jobs without fearing the loss of their health insurance due to pre-existing conditions, as well as provisions dealing with health information privacy. The House passed the final version of the bill by a 421-2 margin, with 227 Republicans and 193 Democrats.Taxpayer Relief Act, 1997 -- which established a child tax credit, tuition tax credits, and penalty-free withdrawals from IRAs for education expenses and first-home purchases, as well as a decrease in the capital gains tax and limitations on the estate tax. The House passed the final version of the bill by a 389-43 margin, with 225 Republicans and 164 Democrats.Balanced Budget Act, 1997 -- a bill that cut spending in order to balance the budget by fiscal year 2002. The House passed the final version of the bill by a 346-85 margin, with 193 Republicans and 153 Democrats.At the presidential bill-signing ceremony on the South Lawn of the White House, Gingrich called for bipartisan leadership across the planet to put aside party differences and address other nagging problems that, like the deficit, worry the public, the Washington Times reported. We will meet the moral integrity test in peacetime of not spending our children's and grandchildren's money, he said. We have a chance over the next three and a half years to work together . . . to accomplish a lot.Overall, Newts four years as speaker can be characterized as gridlock followed by greased wheels, said Donald Wolfensberger, who served as the Republican staff director of the influential House Rules Committee before and during Gingrichs tenure as speaker. Wolfensberger is now director of the Congress Project at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars.Alan Abramowitz, an Emory University political scientist, agreed, and added that the Senate -- long the home of blocked nomination hearings and a filibuster rule that allows one senator to stand in the way of legislation -- has been at least as much a force for gridlock in Washington as the House. The Senate deserves far more blame for gridlock than the House, Abramowitz said.So Gingrich has been more of a prince of partisanship than a godfather of gridlock.Axelrod is mixing up apples and oranges, said John Feehery, a longtime House Republican spokesman who worked under then-House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., among others. Intense partisanship does not necessarily lead to gridlock, and gridlock is not necessarily the result of partisanship.Gillon, who wrote the book on the Clinton-Gingrich relationship, calls the former speaker a very complicated figure. He is a man who will use the most ruthless methods in order to gain power, but who can be restrained, creative, and bipartisan once he has power... The political people in the Clinton White House viewed Gingrich as the antichrist. But many of the policy people – Chief of Staff Leon Panetta, domestic policy adviser Bruce Reed, Chief of Staff Erskine Bowles – painted a portrait of a pragmatic, though temperamental, policymaker.Our rulingSo while Gingrich was sharply partisan, there are solid examples where he short-circuited gridlock to push bills to enactment.",0.5,0.5,1.0,0.5,0.3,0.5,0.5,1.0,0.5,half-true

Final Rating: Half True  ","Obamacare granted the protection against preexisting condition discrimination that extended to more than 150 million Americans, folks who get their health insurance through their employer.","During a recent appearance on MSNBC, Sen. Chris Coons (D-Del.) answered questions from Morning Joe co-host Mika Brzezinski about the latest lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of the Affordable Care Act. The most important part of Obamacare, as you know, Mika, is the protection against preexisting condition discrimination that extended to more than 150 million Americans, folks who get their health insurance through their employer, he said. Because, as almost everyone agrees, health care is complicated, we decided to take a closer look at Coons statement, especially because much has been written and said — and put in campaign ads — about how many Americans have preexisting health conditions and how they gained insurance protections under the ACA. We will not attempt to judge Sen. Coons assertion that the ACAs protection for people with preexisting conditions is the most important part of the law, although it is often mentioned along with the expansion of Medicaid to millions more Americans with low incomes. We started out by contacting Coons office to get the background information on his assertion, but didnt hear back. So, we moved on to examining the statutes and talking to various experts. First came HIPAA What we found out is what few people realize: Protections for preexisting conditions for most people with job-based insurance predated the ACA by more than a decade. The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, is best known for its provisions regarding medical privacy and patient access to their medical records. But the principal purpose of the law was to put an end to what was known as job lock. That happened when people with preexisting health conditions were afraid to leave one job with insurance for another job with insurance because the new insurance would not cover their condition, or would impose long waiting periods. HIPAA was a big advancement at the time in terms of protecting people with preexisting conditions who had employer coverage, said Sabrina Corlette, a research professor who studies health insurance at Georgetown University. Specifically, HIPAA required that as long as someone had been continuously covered by health insurance for at least 12 months, without a break longer than 63 days, new insurance at a new job could not impose waiting periods for a worker or family member. HIPAA also required insurers who sold policies in the small-group market to sell to all small groups, regardless of health status, and to cover every eligible member of the group, also regardless of health status. Most of the states had already attempted to address the job-lock problem by the mid-1990s, but states could not reach the majority of the population with health insurance because they were covered by the federal Employee Retirement Income Security Act, or ERISA. HIPAA basically ratified what most states had already done, said Joel Ario, a former Pennsylvania state insurance commissioner who helped implement the ACA for the federal government. HIPAA also tried to smooth the transition from employer-based insurance to individual coverage by requiring insurers to offer coverage to people who exhausted their post-employment COBRA benefits. (COBRA, short for the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act, was a 1986 law that allowed workers to continue to purchase their employer plans at full cost for up to 18 months.) But HIPAA did not address how much insurers could charge for those plans, and many insurance companies tried to deter enrollment by making premiums unaffordable for nearly anyone who qualified. While the group-to-individual conversion problem was the most glaring gap in HIPAA, it was not the only one. HIPAA did not require employers to offer health coverage nor did it require those who did offer coverage to offer a minimum package of benefits. Most of those gaps were addressed by the ACA. It effectively required large employers to provide a minimum package of benefits (or else pay a substantial fine). The ACA also, for the first time, required insurers to sell policies to individuals with preexisting conditions — without charging them more. Much of HIPAA was written into the health law, making the relationship between the two measures even more complicated. Our ruling In this statement, Coons suggested that that ACA provided pre-existing condition protections to the more than 150 million Americans who get their health coverage through their place of employment. But that is not completely correct.Those were already in place through HIPAA, though expanded by the ACA.",0.5,0.5,1.0,0.5,0.0,0.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,half-true

Final Rating: Half True  ",LeBrons I Promise School To Cost Taxpayers Millions Of Dollars Every Year,"An entertainment blog took a shot at LeBron James for not paying a fair share of the cost of his I Promise School in Akron, Ohio. Wannabe Entertainment published a story criticizing national media for not acknowledging that James isnt paying for the bulk of the schools costs. Its headline paints taxpayers as bearers of the burden for the school, which opened July 30. LeBrons I Promise School To Cost Taxpayers Millions Of Dollars Every Year, it says. Wannabe Entertainment is correct that taxpayers will pay millions of dollars for the school. However, the framing of the article could mislead readers to believe taxpayers will pay millions of dollars on top of what they were paying before, which is not the case. The first few paragraphs of the story are lifted straight from an Aug. 5 Cleveland Plain Dealer story. After that, the Wannabe Entertainment story switches to a diatribeabout Trump's tweeted critique of James and CNN's Don Lemon after an interview and the entire anti-Trump universe coming to the basketball star's defense. Its versiondoes not go on, as the Plain Dealer did, to credit James's investment. The I Promise School is a first-through-eighth grade public school that is part of the Akron Public School District. Because it is a public school, the LeBron James Family Foundation will foot a portion of the cost, but not the entire bill. This is a public school, Akron Public Schools spokesman Mark Williamson told PolitiFact. Taxpayers support all of our schools including this one. Public schools are funded by the state, property taxes and federal funds. So by law, the LeBron James Family Foundation cannot fully fund the school if it wanted to. The foundation pays for the additional services at the school that the other schools in the district do not have, including GED classes and job placement for parents, guest speakers and a food pantry. Stephanie Rosa, a spokeswoman for the LeBron James Family Foundation, told PolitiFact the foundation hasnt added up how much it contributed to the school. A $2 million rough estimate covered some building renovations, such as rewiring for technologyand staff hires for the family center. But the amount of money spent up until the day the school opened has not been made public. Before the opening of Jamess school, the I Promise program had been in Akron elementary schools for more than 10 years. There are 32 elementary schools and kids from all those schools were in the program but now in one location. Its not a new program, not new students, not even a new building, Williamson said. Point being, taxpayers were going to pay for the students whether or not James got involved. There are 46 schools in the Akron Public School District. Williamson said 35 of those schools have been rebuilt and during that time, the home of the current I Promise school served as the temporary school for those students who were displaced in that in-between time. For about 15 years, this building housed every student from every school that has been rebuilt, Williamson said. Williamson said the 240 students enrolled at I Promise were already in the program but in their respective elementary schools. All were doing is taking kids that we already support and putting them in a different location, he said. The cost of educating the students is consistent. So are the teachers salaries. The opening of this school puts all the students in the I Promise program under one roof from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., July through May. There are no additional costs because the district didnt hire any new teachers or recruit new students. A story on Wannabeent.com says, Lebrons I Promise School To Cost Taxpayers Millions Of Dollars Every Year. The headline and subsequent story might leave people thinking James school will be a drag on taxpayer resources. Buttaxpayers are paying the same amount of money theyd pay whether or not James got involved.Jamess foundation is funding enhancements meant to try to elevate students attending the school.

Final Rating: Half True  ","Says Nike pays factory workers, 80% of whom are women, 20 cents an hour and has them work 70 to 80 hours a week.","In September 2018, Nike announced an endorsement deal with former NFL quarterback and activist Colin Kaepernick. Since then, claims about the companys labor practices have flooded the internet, attracting thousands of shares on Facebook and Twitter. Many of these viral posts feature a photo of Nike factory workers accompanied by a claim that the company exploits workers with long hours and abysmally low wages. (Most posts are screenshots of a September 2018 tweet by conservative commentator Ryan Fournier.) The posts say: Just so I'm clear: These factory workers (which are 80% female) are making NIKE's for 20 cents an hour and working 70 to 80 hours a week, so NIKE can profit enough to pay Colin Kaepernick millions to speak out against oppression and injustice? The Associated Press photo accompanying the post is legitimate, though quite old. It shows Vietnamese workers putting finishing touches on Nike shoes at a factory in Ho Chi Minh City in February 2005. The posts were flagged as part of Facebooks efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) It is true that, at one time, Nike paid factory workers close to 20 cents per hour and that many worked over 10 hours a day, six days a week. While most of these numbers are now outdated, experts tell us that overseas factory workers for Nike (and most other major garment industry bands) continue to work long hours for low wages. Lets take a look. In October 1996, CBS 48 Hours news program aired an investigative report on the conditions of Nike factories in Vietnam. The segment revealed that factory workers, mostly women, worked six days a week for only $40 a month, which translated to about 20 cents an hour. An investigation by Dara ORourke, a researcher with the Transnational Resource and Action Center, followed in 1997 and reported several labor law violations at the Vietnamese Tae Kwang Vina plant, a factory that employed over 9,000 workers who produced 400,000 pairs of shoes a month for Nike. According to the investigation, the plants night-shift employees worked an average of 10.5 hours a day, six days per week at a monthly salary of $40. A 2003 World Bank report said Nike violated Vietnamese environmental and labor laws by exposing 10,000 workers at the Tae Kwang Vina plant to toxic solvents and forcing them to work above legal overtime limits. The report noted that the investigations, along with public outcry evoked by activists in Vietnam and the United States, prompted Nike to make improvements: Consequently, Nike took proactive measures and allowed independent auditing of the sweatshops. In 1999, Nike implemented its own Code of Conduct in Vietnamese factories. During recent years, there has been a visible improvement in VTs practices, such as safer work conditions and workers awareness of their rights and entitlements. PolitiFact reached out to the Clean Clothes Campaign, an alliance of labor unions that focuses on improving working conditions in the garment and sportswear industries. The organization told us that the numbers for the pay and hours, arent precise but the sentiment with regard to fair pay and treatment is correct: Factory workers for Nike –– and other major sportswear brands such as Adidas and Under Armour –– do not earn anywhere near a living wage. They confirmed that the claim of 80% of factory workers being women lines up with industry estimates, which have been as high as 85%. Clean Clothes also pointed us to a June 2019 report that surveyed top brands about their progress in implementing a living wage for workers and said most brands –– Nike included –– provided no evidence that their workers anywhere in the world were being paid a living wage. Research from 2014 shows that, in most of the Southeast Asian countries that Nike sources from, wages reach around 25% of a living wage. Paul Roeland, a campaign coordinator with the Clean Clothes Campaign, told PolitiFact that, when it comes to working hours, most workers have a contract to work 48 hours a week but regularly continue working beyond that, often up to 60 hours a week. He said the hours fluctuate and are often longer during peak production times. The factual numbers are shocking enough: it would come down to between 65-90 cents (USD) per hour (depending on the country), and regular 60-hour work weeks, Roeland told PolitiFact by email. That said, he bristled at the overall message in this viral post: At Clean Clothes Campaign, our aim is in supporting garment workers worldwide, as it has been over the past 30 years, Roeland said. However, we strongly believe that criticizing Nike's labour practices with the sole aim of disparaging the anti-racist activism of others, as some right-wing U.S. political figures are doing, is highly disingenuous. Garment workers deserve so much better than to be used as a handy argument in a social media meme. PolitiFact reached out to Nike for a response but did not hear back in time for publication. Nikes code of conduct for supplier facilities reads, the regular work week shall not exceed 48 hours and suppliers should allow workers at least 24 consecutive hours of rest in every seven-day period. All overtime work shall be consensual. Suppliers shall not request overtime on a regular basis and shall compensate all overtime work at a premium rate. Other than in extraordinary circumstances, the sum of regular and overtime hours in a week shall not exceed 60 hours. Its important to note that Nike isnt alone. While wages and hours for factory workers vary from country to country, many major companies use the same factories and all pay the same low wages for their workers. Experts tell us that while it depends on the country and the volume of production, violation of legal overtime standards is common in the garment industry. Viral social media posts claim that Nikes factory employees work 70 to 80 hours a week and get paid 20 cents an hour. The numbers in the post are outdated, but not entirely far off. Today, Nike pays workers more than 20 cents an hour and employees work, on average, a little less than 70 to 80 hours per week. However, workers rights experts tell us the pay from Nike and other major brands is still below a living wage and average weekly hours are routinely well above standard workweeks.",0.7,0.6,1.0,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.4,0.6,0.5,half-true

Final Rating: Half True","41,200 veterans in Florida dont have health care because Scott didnt expand Medicaid.","As Memorial Day approached, both Gov. Rick Scott and his anticipated Democratic rival Charlie Crist called on Veterans Administration Secretary Eric Shinseki to resign amid news reports that VA staff falsified documentation about how long veterans were waiting to receive health care. But then Crist pointed the finger at Scott in a series of tweets on May 22 and 23: • In addition -- if I were governor, I would take immediate action to make sure our veterans here in FL are getting the care they need. • Id call a special session to expand health care to the more than 41,000 FL vets who are left w/o coverage due to Scotts failure. • 41.2k vets in FL dont have health care because Scott didn't expand Medicaid. Unconscionable. It was that last tweet that caught our eye. We decided to fact-check the number Crist cited and whether they lack health care because Scott failed to expand Medicaid. Florida rejects Medicaid expansion Medicaid is an insurance program operated by states in partnership with the federal government to care for low-income people. The Affordable Care Act aimed to expand the program. Specifically, the law would cover all costs for the first three years for states to extend Medicaid to households earning up to 138 percent of the federal poverty level — which in 2013 was $15,865 for an individual, $32,499 for a family of four. Scott, who campaigned on his opposition to Obamacare, initially opposed Medicaid expansion. But in February 2013 he changed his position and came out in support of it. Scott didnt push the Republican-led Legislature to approve it, and ultimately legislators rejected it. The result is that now more than 800,000 uninsured Floridians earn too much to qualify for Medicaid but too little to qualify for subsidies to help buy insurance in the federal marketplace. Urban Institute study  About 40 percent of veterans nationwide are on VA care. Generally, veterans have to serve for two consecutive years and not be discharged dishonorably to be eligible for VA health care, which gives priority to those with service-related injuries or who are low income. Also, some veterans choose not to enroll in VA care, for example, if they dont live near any VA facilities. Some veterans who either arent eligible or choose not to enroll in VA could be eligible for Medicaid. In tweeting his attack, Crist linked to a March 2013 nationwide study by the Washington-based Urban Institute. The study analyzed U.S. Census Bureau data to estimate how many military veterans aged 19 to 64 dont have insurance. (Veterans 65 and older qualify, like other Americans, for Medicare.) The study found that 535,000 uninsured veterans nationwide would qualify for Medicaid or new subsidies under the Affordable Care Act. However, the majority would only qualify for Medicaid if their state chose to expand it. The institutes report said in Florida there were 103,700 non-elderly veterans who lacked health insurance, which included 41,200 who would qualify for Medicaid if the state expanded the program. We ran the study by Jack Tsai, an assistant professor of psychiatry at Yale who co-wrote a separate study about the number of uninsured veterans and Medicaid expansion, but didnt include a state-by-state breakdown. Tsai said that the methodology of the Urban Institute study is fairly solid. However, he noted it is based on data from a few years ago, and that Crists statement didnt include details about the studys limitations. There are various reasons why some veterans remain uninsured: Some might feel they dont need insurance or havent gotten around to obtaining it or may not be aware of their VA eligibility or dont want anything to go to the VA. Likewise, there might be similar reasons to not enroll with Medicaid, while others could be in between jobs. We asked spokespersons for the governors office and his campaign if they had any evidence to refute Crists claim. Campaign spokesman Greg Blair reiterated that Scott supported Medicaid but the Legislature didnt go along with it. He also pointed to 2011 Medicaid reform intended to lower the cost of health care. Our ruling Crist said in a tweet that 41,200 veterans in Florida dont have health care because Scott didnt expand Medicaid. Crists tweet linked to a map that cited the Urban Institute study showing the number of uninsured veterans in each state that might qualify for the Medicaid expansion. Crists tweet omits two major points: Some of those 41,200 veterans could get health care other ways. Its possible some are eligible for services through the VA but for a variety of reasons havent sought those benefits. Also, Scotts not solely responsible for Florida failing to expand Medicaid. After Scott opposed the expansion, he came out in support of it in February 2013. But Scott didnt lobby for it, and the Legislature rejected it last year.",0.5,0.6,0.8,0.5,0.4,0.5,0.5,0.7,0.6,half-true

Final Rating: Half True  ","The Bush administration has the Pentagon trying to take away the signing bonuses when a soldier gets wounded and ends up in the hospital, something that I'm working with a Republican senator to try to make sure never can happen again.","The dig by Sen. Hillary Clinton makes the Bush administration's treatment of wounded veterans seem almost so heartless as to be implausible. The Bush administration sends mixed messages, Clinton said during the Democratic debate in Las Vegas. They want to recruit and retain these young people to serve our country and then they have the Pentagon trying to take away the signing bonuses when a soldier gets wounded and ends up in the hospital, something that I'm working with a Republican senator to try to make sure never can happen again. The Army suggests this issue may all be a tempest in a political teapot, that it simply made a clerical error in asking a wounded vet to return a portion of his signing bonus. But there's another issue, one that may be a bit more legitimate: whether wounded soldiers ought to be guaranteed future installments of enlistment bonuses, bonuses pegged to future years of service they were not able to complete. In 2007, nearly 39,000 army recruits received an average of $16,500 in enlistment bonuses, according to Maj. Nathan M. Banks Sr. of the Department of the Army Public Affairs. The issue Clinton addresses was first raised in July 2007 by the bipartisan Dole-Shalala Commission, when, in the course of work with veterans and their families, they noticed that service members' remaining enlistment bonuses were not being paid when they were injured and medically retired or separated from active duty. The Defense Department assured the problem was fixed. In October 2007, Rep. Jason Altmire, D-Pa., introduced the Veterans Guaranteed Bonus Act to formally ensure that wounded veterans are paid the entirety of any signing bonus they were promised within 30 days after discharge for combat-related wounds. A Senate version of the bill was introduced by Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Ala., in November 2007. The Senate bill has 18 co-sponsors, including Clinton. The issue gathered steam that month when a Pittsburgh television station reported the story of Jordan Fox, an army private who was partially blinded in one eye from the explosion of a roadside bomb in Iraq. After Fox returned home with a medical discharge, he got a letter from the Army asking him to repay $2,800 of a $7,500 enlistment bonus. While Fox was held up by many politicians as Exhibit A in the case for the new legislation, his case also may have muddied the waters. The Army says it simply made an error in pay processing. Defense Department policy is clear: Bonuses already paid should not be recouped if injury or illness of the service member was not the result of the service member's misconduct. The Army contends Fox's was an isolated case. In fact, when it set up a hotline for pay problems, it received just two calls on that issue. So are we talking about legislation to fix a problem that may have affected just three people? As it relates to wounded soldiers having to return portions of paid bonuses, perhaps. And certainly a lot of politicians made a lot of political hay about that. But that's different than unpaid, future installments of bonuses. Say a soldier who got a $10,000 up-front bonus, and was promised an additional $5,000 at the end of each of three years of completed duty. If he was injured and medically discharged in his first year of service, would he get the final two years of unpaid bonuses? Defense Department policy there is less clear. The secretary of the Military Department may decide to pay the soldier unpaid installments if he or she determines that not paying would be against equity and good conscience, or contrary to the best interests of the United States. The legislation Clinton co-sponsored would require the military to pay all future installments upon medical discharge. No one knows, still, how many wounded veterans this may affect. The Congressional Budget Office informally told congressional staffs that the proposed legislation — to include unpaid installments — might cost about $1-million a year. That may seem like a lot of money, but considering the number of wounded vets, it doesn't suggest they think this is a widespread, institutional problem. The Senate bill seeks an accounting by the military to find out. So while Clinton highlights a legitimate issue — paying future installments of enlistment bonuses even after wounded veterans have been discharged — her wording is somewhat misleading, suggesting wounded veterans are being forced to return bonus money. There is little evidence to suggest that happened to more than a couple veterans, and the Army admitted its mistake. Also misleading is her suggestion that there was some kind of Bush administration effort to deny future bonus payments promised to wounded vets. But she may be right that some were denied future bonus payments (although it is far from clear that this is still happening), and the legislation co-sponsored by Clinton would make it crystal clear they are to be paid.

Final Rating: Half True  ",Joe Biden's sanctions on Russia are riddled with loopholes and don't even start for 30 days. They have carve outs for the energy and financial sectors.,"In ads for their 2022 campaigns, some Republicans are attacking President Joe Bidens sanctions on Russia as too slow and too weak. One ad is in the race for an open Senate seat in Ohio, which could help determine which party controls the Senate. Biden's sanctions are riddled with loopholes and don't even start for 30 days, investment banker Mike Gibbons said in his ad on Facebook and Instagram. They have carve outs for the energy and financial sectors. The claim is a mixed bag: Some of the sanctions took immediate effect, some were phased in over 30 days. The energy sector was largely spared, but banks were targeted directly. Russia invaded Ukraine Feb. 24, but the United States began imposing sanctions two days earlier, in response to Russias deployment of troops into two pro-Russian regions of eastern Ukraine. The Feb. 22 sanctions focused on two major Russian state-owned financial institutions, imposed restrictions on Russian sovereign debt and sanctioned five Kremlin-connected elites, according to the U.S. Treasury Department. The Feb. 24 sanctions, according to a Treasury Department news release, targeted all of Russias largest financial institutions and the ability of state-owned and private entities to raise capital — and further bars Russia from the global financial system. Gibbons ad cited that news release. In all, between Feb. 22 and March 3, the U.S. imposed 148 sanctions on Russia, according to a running list produced by CORRECTIV, a nonprofit investigative newsroom in Germany. In announcing the Feb. 24 sanctions, Biden said some effects were immediate, but he also alluded to 30 days in terms of assessing their effects. Weve cut off Russias largest bank — a bank that holds more than one-third of Russias banking assets by itself — cut it off from the U.S. financial system, Biden said. He added: The sanctions we imposed exceed anything thats ever been done. The sanctions we imposed have generated two-thirds of the world joining us. They are profound sanctions. Lets have a conversation in another month or so to see if theyre working. Navin Bapat, a professor of peace and war in political science at the University of North Carolina, said the Feb. 24 sanctions provided for a period of 30 days to allow U.S. financial institutions to wind down their transactions. But the Feb. 22 sanctions took effect more quickly. They prohibited U.S. institutions from participating in purchasing rubles or any other assets from Russian financial institutions after March 1, Bapat said. Gibbons campaign cited clauses in the sanctions that allow exceptions for certain financial transactions, including some related to the energy industry. The Biden administration, facing the possibility that energy sanctions could lead to higher gas prices in the United States and energy prices abroad, has acknowledged that the energy sector was not a major target. Daleep Singh, a deputy national security advisor and deputy director of the National Economic Council, said at a news conference on the Feb. 24 sanctions: To be clear: Our sanctions are not designed to cause any disruption to the current flow of energy from Russia to the world. Weve carved out energy payments on a time-bound basis to allow for an orderly transition of these flows away from sanctioned institutions, and weve provided other licenses to provide for an orderly winddown of business. Republican and Democratic lawmakers have moved to stop the U.S. from importing oil from Russia. Alan Cole, a former economist with Congress Joint Economic Committee and former adviser to U.S. Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, wrote in an article cited by Gibbons campaign that while the sanctions are an impressive effort overall, the sanctions also have a glaring weakness: They largely spare Russias all-important energy sector, the backbone of its entire economy, and its agricultural center — the country is a major wheat exporter. Russia expert Harley Balzer, an emeritus professor of government and international affairs at Georgetown University, told PolitiFact that Biden is endeavoring to balance punishing Russia and preventing serious damage in Europe from rising energy prices and threatened supplies. The financial sanctions are causing havoc on the Russian stock market, causing the market cap of major Russian firms to drop more than 90% on foreign exchanges and clobbering the ruble, he added. Freezing the Russian Central Bank assets abroad reduced their reserves from $600 billion to $300 billion. They are spending $5 billion to $10 billion per day to keep the ruble from depreciating even more. Cronies' assets are being confiscated at an increasing pace. All of that has far more immediate impact than the oil and gas sanctions. Other Republicans have run ads similar to Gibbons. Rep. Ted Budd, who is running for the U.S. Senate in North Carolina, and Georgia U.S. House candidate Alan Sims both said the sanctions were too little, too late; Jeffrey Sossa-Paquette, who is running for a U.S. House in Massachusetts, said the sanctions leave out gas and oil. The Ohio Senate seat Gibbons wants is open because the incumbent, Republican Rob Portman, is not seeking reelection. Both the GOP and the Democratic Senate primaries, to be held May 3, are contested. Besides Gibbons, the Republican candidates include Ohio state Sen. Matt Dolan; former Ohio state treasurer Josh Mandel; former Ohio Republican Party chair Jane Timken; and Hillbilly Elegy author J.D. Vance. The leading Democratic candidate is U.S. Rep. Tim Ryan. Overall, the Ohio race is rated variously by campaign watchers as lean Republican, as likely Republican and solid Republican. Gibbons said Biden's sanctions on Russia are riddled with loopholes and don't even start for 30 days. They have carve outs for the energy and financial sectors. Some of the sanctions made a quick impact and some were phased in over 30 days. The energy sector was largely spared, but banks were targeted directly.",0.5,0.5,1.0,0.5,0.0,0.5,0.5,1.0,0.5,half-true

Final Rating: Half True  ","Since 2000, Texas has reduced harmful pollutants in the air like nitrogen oxide by 62.5 percent, and ozone by 23 percent--a reduction that is 12 percent greater than the national average.","Gov. Rick Perry visited a familiar boast about the clearing skies of Texas in a May 19, 2014, letter to President Barack Obama that may have tested possible themes of another gubernatorial run for president. Saying Texas employs an all-of-the-above energy strategy tapping fossil fuels plus solar, biofuel and wind resources, Perry wrote: Even as our population has grown by more than 5 million since 2000, we've led the U.S. energy revolution while protecting our environment and reducing harmful pollutants in the air like nitrogen oxide by 62.5 percent, and ozone by 23 percent — a reduction that is 12 percent greater than the national average. 62, 23, 12 — sounds like a quarterbacks call before the snap. We were curious about his numbers. Is Perry right about the pollution reductions as well as the cuts outpacing decreases nationally? A 2010 fact check Perry made a similar claim in June 2010, saying in a press release the Texas clean air program (has) achieved a 22 percent reduction in ozone and a 46 percent decrease in NOx (nitrogen oxide) emissions. Hed earlier cited the same statistic in a letter to Obama. Half True, we found then. Perry accurately recapped improvements in ozone levels. But as for the NOx emissions contributing to ozone levels, his statistic included only one NOx source — industrial — which he did not note. Notably, nearly three-quarters of NOx emissions come from other sources. Also, whether state government merited credit for the improvements struck us as worthy of pause. Even if the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality was responsible for the drop in industrial NOx emissions, federal efforts — in particular, vehicle emission regulations — were a key factor. Significantly, too, the state's ozone-related programs existed to help Texas comply with federal expectations. As noted then, a goal of the federal Clean Air Act is to reduce the levels of what the Environmental Protection Agency calls commonly found air pollutants. Among those is ground-level ozone, which forms when nitrogen oxide emissions mix with volatile organic compounds in sunlight and heat. Common sources of nitrogen oxides: cars and trucks, power plants and industrial boilers. EPA sets limits on the concentration of ozone, the primary component of smog, in the air. Areas that fail to meet the standard are designated in nonattainment. Under the Clean Air Act, the state is required to submit plans to EPA that outline how it will clean up areas and meet the federal standard. Figures hold up As in 2010, we asked David T. Allen, a University of Texas professor of chemical engineering, about Perrys statement. By email, Allen noted that per figures posted online by the TCEQ, Perrys analysis holds up. Allen also pointed out an EPA web page indicating that nationally ozone levels in 2012 were down 9 percent compared to 2000 with NOx levels down 29 to 50 percent, depending on the measurement applied. Separately by email, commission spokesman Terry Clawson sent us a spreadsheet he described as the basis of the charts. Clawson said the data came from the EPA. Lets recap the charted changes in ozone, then NOx. Ozone down 23 percent According to a commission chart on a web page last updated April 17, 2014, ozone in Texas decreased 23 percent from 2000 through 2012, as Perry said. (The comparisons reflect what officials call fourth-high ozone readings. Clawson emailed us this technical explanation.) A headline on the chart says the ozone decrease for the other 49 states averaged 11 percent. Texas ran 12 percentage points ahead of that. The chart shows ozone decreasing in all but a few states--Wyoming, Utah, Idaho, Montana, South Dakota, Hawaii and Alaska--with the drop in Texas bested only by Tennessee, California and Georgia.  Source: Web page, Air Quality Successes - Criteria Pollutants, Texas Commission on Environmental Quality, last updated April 17, 2014 (accessed May 21, 2014) NOx from industrial sources down 62.5 percent In the period, Allen emailed, industrial emissions of NOx (not including motor vehicles) in Texas dropped 62.5 percent. He pointed out a commission chart indicating that industrial NOx emissions of more than 300,000 xx tons in 2011 compared to a shade less than 800,000 xx tons per year in 2000, which works out to a 62.5 percent reduction, as Perry said.  Source: Web page, Air Quality Successes - Emissions Inventory, Texas Commission on Environmental Quality, last updated April 17, 2014 (accessed May 21, 2014) Sierra Club stresses federal role For another perspective, we turned to Neil Carman of the Lone Star chapter of the Sierra Club. By phone, Carman called Perrys figures accurate though he suggested the cited reductions occurred mainly thanks to federal laws and enforcement. Carman, director of the clubs Clean Air program, said the federal government still considers the multi-county Houston and Dallas-Fort Worth areas as not attaining minimum ozone standards. He pointed out a Sierra Club press release stating the club on May 20, 2014, filed suit against the EPA for failing to classify Dallas-Fort Worth as having a severe ozone problem, an action that would have required polluters to clean the air, the press release says. By email, Carman said the governor's claim misleads by lumping together Texas' ozone woes in Houston and Dallas-Fort Worth with all the other ozone areas in the nation, including areas that have minimal or no problems. A comparison to other states with few ozone problems is roughly analogous to comparing a driver who gets 30 speeding tickets a year and reduces it by 50% over ten years to 15 per year, Carman said, while a second driver only had 3 tickets and reduces it by 33% to 2 tickets per year. The first driver had the greatest (percentage) reduction at 50% and the greatest volume reduction but also had the worst speeding record. Earlier, Clawson indicated the gains noted by Perry werent entirely due to federal oversight. By email, he noted a 1999 Texas law that required power plants to reduce NOx emissions, also saying other state laws enacted since 2000 stressed energy efficiency, reductions in pollution and renewable energy sources like wind power. Clawson, asked about the bulk of NOx pollution coming from vehicles and non-industrial sources, which Perrys statement did not take up, said NOx emissions from non-industrial sources in Texas in 2011 were 42 percent less than what such sources emitted in 1999. Our ruling Perry said that since 2000, Texas has reduced harmful pollutants in the air like nitrogen oxide by 62.5 percent, and ozone by 23 percent— a reduction that is 12 percent greater than the national average. Those figures are accurate, but the claim (like Perrys 2010 statement) takes into account only one NOx source — industrial — which it failed to note. Nearly three-quarters of NOx emissions come from other sources. Perrys declaration also didn't reflect on federal laws and oversight that figure into pollution reductions. Texas didnt make the gains in isolation. HALF TRUE – The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context.

Final Rating: Half True  ",Says his opponent Dorman Grace brags on his Facebook page about receiving illegal campaign contributions.,"One of the most talked-about political ads of the primary election season comes courtesy of a relatively obscure race: the Republican primary for the Alabama Commissioner of Agriculture and Industries.It's the tough-talking, rifle-toting Dale Cowboy Peterson who propels the ad to an instant classic. To date, the ad has been viewed more 1.2 million times on YouTube. In it, Peterson aims his most pointed verbal attack against Republican primary opponent Dorman Grace.Dorman Grace brags on his Facebook page about receiving contributions from industries he would regulate. Bragging about receiving illegal money on Facebook. Who on earth would support such a dummy?It's one thing to call your opponent a dummy. It's another to call him a cheat. And so we decided to check out Peterson's claim that Grace was guilty of taking illegal campaign contributions. And then bragging about it on Facebook.Campaign finance reports submitted to the Alabama Secretary of State, and viewable online, show that Grace has taken contributions from several farms. Among them, deer and poultry farms. And on his Facebook page, Grace thanked some of the supporters who have contributed to his campaign, including some of the farmers in question.So are the contributions illegal?In 1998, the Alabama Legislature passed a law to prohibit the Commissioner of the Department of Agriculture and Industries or a candidate for the office of commissioner from accepting campaign contributions from persons associated with businesses regulated by the department.The contributions to Grace have given rise to several complaints with the state Ethics Commission -- not by Peterson -- but the commission has yet to rule on them.He's no expert on election laws, Peterson said in a phone interview with PolitiFact, but this seems pretty cut and dry.You can readily see that industries that we regulate, he's accepting money from them, Peterson said.End of story? Not necessarily.The Grace campaign says it has done nothing wrong because the contributions to the campaign don't come from industries regulated by the agriculture commissioner.Tullie Culverhouse, campaign manager for Grace, contends the law was intended to bar contributions from agencies regulated by the ag commissioner, such as fertilizer and pest control companies which have to come to the department for a permit to operate in Alabama.Poultry farms are not regulated by the department, Culverhouse said. They are serviced by the department. The only thing they do is serve the industry with disease control. This is frivolous.So those are the competing opinions of the two campaigns.We spoke with Glen Zorn, the assistant ag commissioner and Democratic candidate for the top agriculture job. Zorn doesn't think it would be accurate to say, for example, that poultry farms are regulated by thecommissioner. He hasn't taken any money from any poultry farmers, he said, but he would.The law about not accepting contributions from persons associated with businesses regulated by the department has never been tested, and remains a gray area, said Jeff Webb, legal advisor to the Agriculture Commissioner.We can go on anyone's property that is growing hens and make sure they are following all of the mandates to prevent outbreaks of infectious or contagious disease, Webb said. And so, he said, There is an argument that they are regulated by us.But there's a pretty good argument in the other direction, too, he said.Ray Hilburn, Poultry Program Director for the Alabama Department of Agriculture, said he doesn't view the department's role as a regulator of poultry farms.We regulate diseases, he said. We do disease work. We make sure the birds are disease-free. But we don't regulate the poultry growers themselves, in my opinion.Ultimately, it appears the state Ethics Commission is going to have to decide whether these contributions were improper (and it seems unlikely we'll hear a decision before next month's Republican primary). But we think it's fair to say that when the state's poultry program director and the legal advisor to the Alabama Department of Agriculture say the law is untested and unclear, it's a bit of a gray area.

Final Rating: Half True  ","Says the average Ohio student graduates from a four-year college or university with nearly $27,000 in tuition debt.","Editor's note: We originally rated this claim True. After receiving feedback from readers, we have downgraded that rating to Half True because the claim applies the average debt of about $27,000 to a much broader group than did the study from which it was cited. Interest rates on federally subsidized student loans went on the front burner as a political issue after Mitt Romney followed President Obama in saying he did not want those rates to go up. Congressional Republicans -- who earlier passed a budget allowing the rates to double in July to their 2007 rate of 6.8 percent -- closed ranks behind their presumptive presidential nominee.They voted for a hastily introduced bill that would keep the rate at 3.4 percent, and pay for it with funds intended for preventive health care programs under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.Raiding that fund made the legislation unpalatable for Democrats -- just as the Democratic proposals to extend the lower interest rates were unpalatable to Republicans.One of the proposals would have paid for the college loan subsidies by ending tax subsidies for oil and gas companies. Another would end a payroll tax exemption given some business owners.Ohio's Sen. Sherrod Brown was a co-sponsor of the latter bill and of earlier legislation to stop the loan rates from going up.Federally-subsidized Stafford loans have allowed thousands of students—who might not otherwise be able pay for to college—afford the ever-increasing cost of higher education, he said in a news release. With the average Ohio student graduating from a four-year institution with nearly $27,000 in tuition bills, the last thing we should be doing is adding to their already-heavy debt load.The figure of $27,000 caught the notice of PolitiFact Ohio. It is more than $6,700 per year for four years of school.We asked Brown's office for his source and more information. They referred us to the Project on Student Debt, a project of the independent, nonprofit Institute for College Access and Success.Its most recent survey of public and private four-year institutions in Ohio found that 68 percent of students graduate in debt, and that the average debt on college loans is $27,713 -- the 7th-highest statewide average in the nation. (New Hampshire was highest, with average debt of $31,048; Wyoming was lowest, with $20,571.)The actual debt level is probably higher, the Project on Student Debt noted, because the data is voluntarily reported by colleges and not available for all of them.The report also reflects only graduates of public and private nonprofit colleges because few for-profit colleges report the student debt data. Based on national surveys by the U.S. Department of Education, graduates of for-profit four-year colleges are much more likely to borrow student loans, and borrow significantly more, than counterparts at nonprofit institutions.Nationally, according to a report from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, the average student loan balance per borrower is $23,300. The median balance is roughly half of that, $12,800. About one-quarter of borrowers nationally owe more than $28,000, and about 10 percent owe more than $54,000, according to the New York Fed.In aggregate, the bank said, the outstanding student loan balance now stands at about $870 billion, surpassing the nations total credit card balance ($693 billion) and the total auto loan balance ($730 billion). About 37 million people hold outstanding student loan debt.The key with all these figures is that they deal specifically with students who borrow and then graduate with loan debt.So how does that mesh with Browns claim? In his statement he said the average Ohio student graduating from a four-year institution. That describes a bigger pool of people than just the students who graduate with debt. In that most recent survey it would also include the 32 percent of the graduates who had no debt. But the figure Brown cited, nearly $27,000, was an average covering just those students who graduated with debt.Browns statement is partially accurate. He cites the correct figure from a survey on debt among college students. But he describes those affected by debt too broadly, applying the average to all rather than just those who graduate with loan balances. Including all students would lower the average for loan debt by about a third. Thats an important detail needed to fully understand Browns claim.On the Truth-O-Meter, Browns statement rates as Half True.",0.6,0.6,1.0,0.7,0.0,0.2,0.5,1.0,0.5,half-true

Final Rating: Half True","Says Kansas U.S. House candidate Paul Davis was caught with a stripper during a drug raid and later voted to allow strip clubs to open near homes, churches, schools and daycare facilities.","A new ad from the Congressional Leadership Fund, a super PAC working to protect the GOP Majority in the U.S. House, attacks a Kansas congressional hopeful for an incident at a strip club 20 years ago. You bet we wanted to see if the facts here stood up to scrutiny. Democrat Paul Davis is locked in a competitive race with Republican Steve Watkins in Kansas 2nd Congressional District, a seat that includes Topeka, Lawrence and the communities west of Kansas City. The ad targets Davis for his alleged involvement in a 1998 strip club drug raid, where he was found in a dark room with a nearly naked woman. Whats worse than getting caught at a strip club during a drug bust? Ask Paul Davis. The ad then claims Davis was found in a VIP room with a woman wearing only a G-string.Then it says, Even worse, after Davis was caught with a stripper, he voted to allow strip clubs to open near our homes, churches, schools and even daycare facilities. Shady Paul Davis cant be trusted. Here, we are checking the details surrounding the strip club incident, along with the claim that Davis voted to allow strip clubs to operate near places like schools, homes, churches and daycares. The situation involving Davis and a strip club came to light in September 2014 during his bid for governor, which he lost. According to reports, Davis was getting a lap dance in a back room in the late 1990s when cops raided the club in search of drugs. He was not charged with a crime, but police involved in the raid reported he was found in a compromising position. Davis said he was at the wrong place at the wrong time. Independence Police Chief Harry Smith later corroborated Davis account that the candidate was not involved in any wrongdoing, or, to his knowledge, the focus of an investigation. He said Davis was questioned briefly before being released. Kelsi Browning, a spokeswoman for Davis campaign, told PolitiFact that the ad is based on something that happened 20 years ago when Davis was 26. As a new lawyer, she said, Daviswent with his boss to meet an unsavory client of the law firm. The ad refers to HB 2107, or the Community Defense Act, which was a 2011 state bill that would have prohibited strip clubs and other sexually oriented businesses from being established within 1,000 feet of the property line of an existing one as well as any schools, churches, public parks, residences, libraries or daycare centers. The bill would have also required semi-nude dancers to remain at least 6 feet away from their customers and for sexually oriented businesses to remain closed from midnight to 6 a.m. Davis was one of 28 Kansas House members who voted against the bill, which ultimately failed in the Senate. The Davis campaign says that the legislation was a perennial bill thatrarely made it out of committee. When it first came up in 2010, Davis actually voted for the bill before it was struck down in the Senate. It came up again in the 2011 session, but this time, he voted against it. Critics of the legislation, which included Davis, argued at the time that regulating these businesses was best left to cities and counties. Some also questioned taking the time to focus on the issue when the state was facing a massive budget deficit. In a Lawrence Journal-World story around the time of the vote, Davis, who was the House minority leader, was quoted saying that the Legislature was probably intruding in areas where we dont need to be. Weve got a lot more important things that we need to be dealing with here. The Congressional Leadership Fund ad says that Kansas U.S. House candidate Paul Davis was caught with a stripper during a drug raid and later voted to allow strip clubs to open near homes, churches, schools and daycares. The ad is piecing together two unrelated issues to draw an unsavory conclusion, while embellishing parts of the story. Davis did not vote to allow strip clubs to open near schools, churches, daycares and the like. He once voted against a measure that would have banned them from opening near these places. He also once voted for the same proposal. The ads claim that he was found in a strip club during a drug raid is accurate, but any suggestion he was connected to the drug raid is misplaced. Overall, this claim is partially accurate but takes things out of context.",0.5,0.8,0.9,0.6,0.7,0.8,0.5,0.8,0.6,half-true

Final Rating: True  ",Says fewer than 30 percent of Texas college students graduate in four years and only 58 percent graduate within six years.,"Rick Perry, who has said he wants the 2013 Legislature to impose a four-year tuition freeze for incoming freshmen, said at a Dallas press conference that such a move would give students an economic incentive to graduate on time.Less than 30 percent of our students graduate in four years; only 58 percent of our students have their degrees in six years, Perry said, according to an Oct. 2, 2012, Dallas Morning News news story. That is a system that can and must be improved.He aired a similar claim in a CBS News interview Oct. 10, 2012, saying: One of the problems weve got is that only 30 percent of our college students are graduating in a four-year period of time.We previously explored a similar claim by state Rep. Scott Hochberg, D-Houston, who said in June 2010 that about a third of Texas high school graduates who go to college end up getting through college. His statement rated True; our look also quoted an official from the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board pointing out that 57 percent of Texas students were graduating within six years.Perry spokeswoman Catherine Frazier said the Republican governor drew his figures from the board, and a board spokesman, Dominic Chavez, guided us to the agencys 2012 Higher Education Almanac.A chart in the report says 29.9 percent of Texas students who initially enrolled as full-time students in the states four-year public colleges and universities graduated within four years. It says 58.4 percent of full-time students graduated within six years, with 65.6 percent doing so within 10 years. Fewer part-time students graduated within the time periods.Chavez said by email that the four-year graduation rate of nearly 30 percent reflects 18,396 graduates out of 61,485 full-time students in the fiscal year running through August 2011 who had enrolled as first-time students four years earlier. Notably, he said, the state can track students who switch schools by tracking them using Social Security numbers or another identifier.And the 30 percent rate reflects improvement from the previous decade, Chavez said. By the same measure, nearly 20 percent of fourth-year undergraduates had graduated by August 2000, a rate based on 8,352 graduates among 41,925 fourth-year students.Not only did rate go up, he said, but the number of students increased as well.As noted in our check of Hochbergs statement, two caveats apply. First, the data dont account for students who enrolled in a Texas institution and then transferred out of state. Second, while the enrollment data include students who attended school out of state, the data dont track whether they graduated.Separately, the U.S. Department of Education also gauges college graduation rates by state. In 2009, its latest figures indicate, 48.5 percent of Texas students who had enrolled six years earlier had earned bachelors degrees, compared with 55.5 percent nationally.The same year, 25.4 percent of Texas students who had enrolled three years earlier seeking community college associates degrees had succeeded, compared with 29.2 percent nationally. Based on the raw numbers behind each rate, we reached a combined graduation rate of 38 percent.In contrast to the Texas boards calculation, the federal figures do not account for students who transferred from one institution to another.We asked Patrick Kelly, who works for the agency that oversees the federal graduation figures, to appraise the Texas boards method of calculating graduation rates. This makes sense, he said, calling the approach a straightforward, standard way of tracking students including those who change schools.Our rulingPerry said fewer than 30 percent of Texas college students graduate in four years and only 58 percent graduate within six years. That information is drawn from the states higher education oversight agency.",1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,true

Final Rating: True  ",Says state Senate recall challenger Sandy Pasch voted to cut school aid by nearly $300 million.,"The target in one of the most competitive of Wisconsins nine Senate recall races is state Sen. Alberta Darling, R-River Hills, an architect of a 2011-2013 state budget that reduces aid to public schools by nearly $800 million.But one of the states major political players, the conservative Club for Growth Wisconsin, is turning the tables. It claims Darlings challenger, state Rep. Sandy Pasch, D-Whitefish Bay, also backed a sizable school funding cut.The attack is part of a radio ad that began airing about a week before Pasch won the Democratic primary.Club for Growth, which advocates for limited government and minimal taxation, mostly branded Pasch as a tax-and-spender in the ad. But at one point, the female narrator says Pasch voted to to cut school aid by nearly $300 million.Club for Growth also makes the school aid claim in similar ads that have targeted two other Assembly Democrats who are challenging incumbent Republicans in recall races, according to the La Crosse Tribune.They are Rep. Jennifer Shilling of La Crosse, running against Sen. Dan Kapanke of La Crosse; and Rep. Fred Clark of Baraboo, challenging Luther Olsen of Ripon. Those elections, and the Pasch-Darling contest, are on Aug. 9, 2011.When we asked for evidence to back the claim against Pasch, Club for Growth spokesman R. J. Johnson cited a May 2009 Milwaukee Journal Sentinel article.It referred to the 2009-2011 budget submitted by then-Gov. Jim Doyle, a Democrat, which proposed cutting state aid for schools by $290 million. That was before the Legislature, then controlled by Democrats, voted on the budget.But a month later, Pasch joined all but two Assembly Democrats in approving the spending plan. The final budget cut general school aid by $294 million -- to $9.3 billion -- over two years, according to the nonpartisan Legislative Fiscal Bureau.So, Club for Growth Wisconsin is correct in saying Pasch voted to cut school aid nearly $300 million. But is that whole story?In the same article cited by Club for Growth, Doyle said total spending on public schools would actually rise by about 5 percent because schools would get an additional $877 million in federal stimulus funds. That seemed to indicate that stimulus money would more than offset the state aid reduction. Gillian Morris, Paschs campaign spokeswoman, said that was also her understanding of what happened.But that was not the case.According to the fiscal bureau and the state Department of Public Instruction, the $294 million aid reduction took into account both the cut in state funds and the federal stimulus money that was added in.In other words, the stimulus money was not enough to offset the state funding cut. The net result for schools was a reduction in funding of $294 million.In sum, Club for Growth Wisconsin claimed that Pasch voted to cut nearly $300 million in aid to schools. The record shows the claim was on the mark.",1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,true

Final Rating: True  ",Large majorities of the public oppose major changes to Medicare and favor higher taxes on the wealthy.,"The debate to balance the federal budget and reduce the nation's debt has raged in recent weeks, with Democrats and Republicans arguing about spending, taxes and entitlements such as Medicare.Paul Krugman wrote recently in his New York Times column that a knock-down, drag-out fight may be inevitable, given that the two parties have such different visions for the country.So when pundits call on the parties to sit down together and talk, the obvious question is, what are they supposed to talk about? Wheres the common ground? Krugman wrote.Krugman, who sides with the Democrats over Republicans on budget issues, said the Democrats have a winning case to present to the public.For what its worth, polls suggest that the publics priorities are nothing like those embodied in the Republican budget, Krugman said. Large majorities support higher, not lower, taxes on the wealthy. Large majorities — including a majority of Republicans — also oppose major changes to Medicare. Of course, the poll that matters is the one on Election Day. But thats all the more reason to make the 2012 election a clear choice between visions.We decided to check Krugmans numbers on the polls after a reader asked us to look into it. Lets take the issues one at a time.Large majorities support higher, not lower, taxes on the wealthy.Different polls phrase the question differently, but the bottom line is the same. We found three recent polls that back up Krugmans point.In order to reduce the national debt, would you support or oppose raising taxes on Americans with incomes over 250 thousand dollars a year? Support: 72 percent. Oppose: 27 percent. Unsure: 1 percent. (ABC News/Washington Post Poll. April 14-17, 2011)Do you support or oppose doing each of the following to deal with the federal budget deficit?  Increase taxes on income over $250,000. Support: 64 percent. Oppose: 33 percent. Unsure: 3 percent. (McClatchy-Marist Poll. April 10-14, 2011.)Now looking ahead to next year's federal budget, do you think it should or should not include higher taxes for families with household incomes of $250,000 and above? Should: 59 percent. Should not: 37 percent. Unsure: 4 percent. (USA Today/Gallup Poll. April 11, 2011.)Krugman seems on firm ground here.Large majorities also oppose major changes to Medicare.Again, we found several recent poll questions addressing this point.In order to reduce the national debt, would you support or oppose cutting spending on Medicare, which is the government health insurance program for the elderly? Oppose: 78 percent. Support: 21 percent. Unsure: 1 percent. (ABC News/Washington Post Poll. April 14-17, 2011.)I'm going to read you two statements about the future of the Medicare program. After I read both statements, please tell me which one comes closer to your own view. Medicare should remain as it is today, with a defined set of benefits for people over 65. OR, Medicare should be changed so that people over 65 would receive a check or voucher from the government each year for a fixed amount they can use to shop for their own private health insurance policy. Should remain as is: 65 percent. Should be changed: 34 percent. Unsure: 2 percent. (Also from the ABC News/Washington Post Poll. April 14-17, 2011.)Do you think the government should completely overhaul Medicare to control the cost of the program, make major changes to Medicare but not completely overhaul it, make minor changes to Medicare, or should the government not try to control the costs of Medicare? Not try to control costs: 27 percent. Minor changes: 34 percent. Major changes: 18 percent. Completely overhaul: 13 percent. Unsure: 8 percent. (USA Today/Gallup Poll. April 11, 2011.)In order to reduce the federal budget deficit, would you be willing or not willing to reduce spending on Medicare, the government health insurance program for seniors? Not willing: 76 percent. Willing: 22 percent. Don't know/No answer: 2 percent. (CBS News Poll. March 18-21, 2011.)Do you think it will be necessary to cut spending on Medicare, the federal government health care program for seniors, in order to significantly reduce the federal budget deficit? No: 54 percent. No opinion: 27 percent. Yes: 18 percent. Not sure: 1 percent. (NBC News/Wall Street Journal Poll. Feb. 24-26, 2011.)For each (government program), please tell me if you think significantly cutting the funding is totally acceptable, mostly acceptable, mostly unacceptable, totally unacceptable: Medicare. Totally unacceptable: 46 percent. Mostly unacceptable: 30 percent. Mostly acceptable: 16 percent. Totally acceptable: 7 percent. Unsure: 1 percent. (Also from NBC News/Wall Street Journal Poll. Feb. 24-26, 2011.)Those numbers express widespread opposition to cutting Medicare. And indeed, when the Wall Street Journal reported its results in February, Republican pollster Bill McInturff said the results were a huge flashing yellow sign for Republicans on how much preparation will be needed if they propose to change Social Security and Medicare. As we were working on this report, a new poll was released suggesting that the public might not be so opposed to changes in Medicare. We should note that these results were released publicly after Krugman's column appeared. As explained in the Principles of PolitiFact and the Truth-O-Meter, our rulings are based on the information known at the time the person made the remarks. In order to reduce the budget deficit, it has been proposed that Medicare should be changed from a program in which the government pays doctors and hospitals for treating seniors to a program in which the government helps seniors purchase private health insurance. Would you approve or disapprove of changing Medicare in this way? Approve: 47 percent. Disapprove: 41 percent. Don't Know/No answer: 12 percent. (New York Times/CBS News Poll. April 15-20, 2011.) The New York Times noted in its story that the response was at odds with other recent polls, and concluded that results may vary depending on how the question was asked. When we contacted Krugman for a comment, he noted that the poll came out after his column was published and that it's at odds with the other previous polls. I strongly suspect that the Times result is an outlier -- it looks so different from everything else we're hearing, Krugman said via e-mail. We should note that Krugman parenthetically added that a majority of Republicans also opposed major changes to Medicare. We were not able to find party breakdowns for all of these polls, but the ones we did see showed that Republicans opposed changes to Medicare as well. A CBS News Poll from March showed that 67 percent of Republicans were not willing to reduce spending on Medicare. In the USA Today/Gallup poll, 33 percent of Republicans said the government should not try to control the costs of Medicare, with another 28 percent of Republicans said the government should make only minor changes.Our rulingKrugman said that large majorities support support higher, not lower, taxes on the wealthy, and recent polls support that point. On Medicare, several polls suggest that large majorities, including a majority of Republicans, oppose major changes to the program. One poll, released after Krugman wrote his column, showed an advantage for the Ryan plan. But the preponderance of evidence at the time Krugman made his statement bears him out.",1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,true

Final Rating: True  ","If you look at the hospitalizations at Ruby Memorial in West Virginia, and around the country, 90% to 95% of those hospitalized are unvaccinated.","West Virginia University faculty members held a special meeting on Sept. 1 to begin consideration of a proposal to strengthen the universitys rules on the coronavirus by making vaccines mandatory on campus. During the meeting, one faculty member — Kathryn Moffett Bradford, the division chief of pediatric infectious diseases at WVU's School of Medicine — offered a statistic that she said supported the importance of getting vaccinated for the coronavirus. If you look at the hospitalizations at Ruby Memorial in West Virginia, and around the country, 90% to 95% of those hospitalized are unvaccinated, she said. She was referring to J.W. Ruby Memorial Hospital in Morgantown, W.Va., which is part of WVUs health system. Angela Knopf, director of media relations and public affairs for J.W. Ruby Memorial Hospital, confirmed to PolitiFact West Virginia that at the time the faculty meeting was held on Sept. 1, about 90% to 95% of the patients hospitalized for COVID-19 were unvaccinated. Moreover, Knopfsaid that as of Sept. 13, 2021, fully 100% of the patients in the intensive care unit at Ruby Memorial were unvaccinated. How about the numbers nationally? The share of the unvaccinated in hospitals for COVID-19 is also well above 90%. As of Aug. 2, 2021, more than 164 million people in the United States had been fully vaccinated and, based on reports from 49 U.S. states and territories, there were 7,525 breakthrough cases in which the person was hospitalized or died, according to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, we reported in August. That comes out to less than one-hundredth of 1%. This pattern was borne out by a subsequent study published by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention. Between April 4 to July 17 of 2021, the study found, a bit over 92% of those hospitalized for COVID-19 were not fully vaccinated. That number refers to those who had received their first dose of the vaccine but not their second dose. These numbers also only reflect the 13 U.S. states that were involved in the study, which is about 25% of the U.S. population. Bradford said, If you look at the hospitalizations at Ruby Memorial in West Virginia, and around the country, 90% to 95% of those hospitalized are unvaccinated. Ruby Memorial Hospital confirmed that at the time of her remark, about 90% to 95% of those hospitalized for COVID-19 were unvaccinated. As for the national picture, statistics from the CDC published both before and after her comment broadly support those percentages.

Currently, 17 women--which had been the record--serve in the chamber, the story says, adding that Olympia Snowe, R-Maine, and Hutchison are retiring.We harvested historical perspective from a Senate web page listing the 39 women who have served as senators since a 24-hour appointee, Rebecca Latimer Felton of Georgia, took the oath in November 1922.Current female senators, in order of seniority with the most experienced first, are: Barbara Mikulski, D-Md.; Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif.; Barbara Boxer, D-Calif.; Patty Murray, D-Wash.; Hutchison; Snowe; Mary Landrieu, D-La; Susan Collins, R-Maine.; Deborah Stabenow, D-Mich.; Marie E.

Final Rating: True","Six of the 10 richest counties in the United States surround Washington, D.C.","Mike Huckabee says hes found the road to riches, and its called the Capital Beltway. Six of the 10 richest counties in the United States surround Washington, D.C., the GOP presidential candidate said during a Sept. 24 interview on The John Fredericks Show, a Hampton Roads-based radio program. Huckabee, a former Arkansas governor, cited the statistic while contending that federal power brokers have set up a system that shields them from economic hard times. We emailed Huckabees campaign asking for the source of his numbers and didnt hear back. But PolitiFact has examined variations of his statement that have been uttered by three other Republicans: Ohio Rep. Jim Jordan, former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin and, most recently, Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker. The six-of-10 figure is a reference to the counties with the highest median household income, a widely used measure of county-wide wealth. The U.S. Census Bureau compiles the income data each year. Here are the 10 counties with the highest median income in 2013, the latest year for which figures are available: Loudoun County, Va. -- $117,680 Falls Church, Va. -- $117,452 Los Alamos County, N.M. -- $110,930 Fairfax County, Va. -- $110,658 Howard County, Md. -- $108,503 Hunterdon County, N.J -- $107,203 Douglas County, Colo. -- $105,192 Arlington County, Va. -- $101,533 Morris County, N.J. -- $99,950 Montgomery County, Md. -- $97,873 That list includes six counties -- four in Virginia and two in Maryland -- that are located outside Washington. Although Falls Church is a city, its treated as a county by the Census Bureau. We looked at the annual Census Bureau figures going back to 2009. In each of those years, there also were a half-dozen D.C. suburban counties that made the top 10 list of the highest median household income. Its no secret that the federal government is the major seed of affluence in the D.C. area, sprouting high-paying government and contracting jobs. The suburbs have some of the highest education levels in the nation, according to Terry Rephann, a regional economist at the University of Virginias Weldon Cooper Center for Public Service. We should make a statistical note here. Median household income is the midrange point where half of the countys households make more than the median and the other half makes less. For example, if only five families lived in a county, the median income would be that of the third highest-earning household. Not all measures rank the D.C. suburbs among the 10 richest counties. Money magazine, for example, looked at average income -- the total income in a county divided by its residents. Based on that data from 2012, none of the counties near Washington made a Money list of the 10 richest counties published last year. If youre wondering, No. 1 in was Teton County in Wyoming. Rephann, however, told us that average income can easily be thrown off by a few extremely wealthy people living in a less populous rural county. Median income is a better way to measure the richest counties, he said. Well also note that while median incomes are high around Washington, that doesnt mean everything is rosy there. Economists told us for a recent fact-check that the Virginia economy has taken a hit in recent years amid federal budget-cutting in D.C. Our ruling Huckabee said six of the 10 richest counties in the United States surround Washington, D.C. Judged by median household income -- a standard way for tracking a countys wealth -- his statement is correct.",1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,true

Final Rating: True  ",Medicaid is the primary source of health insurance for 41.7 percent of Hispanic children in Georgia.,"In a recent broadcast, WABE-FM (90.1) led into a story on the impact of proposed deficit-cutting measures with a shocking number.Forty-one point seven percent of Latino children in Georgia rely on Medicaid programs for health care, the reporter said, before cutting to tape of Jennifer Ngandu, deputy director of health policy for the National Council of La Raza, a Hispanic advocacy group.Ngandu said a Republican-led proposal in Congress to cut the deficit, in part with $1.4 trillion in cuts to Medicaid over 10 years, would have disproportionate effect on Hispanics because they are more likely to rely on taxpayer-funded health care.That figure – 41.7 percent – is eye-popping. We wondered if it was accurate. The number comes from La Razas report The Meaning of Medicaid: A State-by-State Breakdown, recently released as a rebuttal to the GOP plan.It turns out the nexus here is between race or ethnicity and poverty.More than a quarter of Hispanics in the United States live in poverty, according to the U.S. census. The poverty rate has gotten worse in recent years for everybody, but Hispanics and blacks have the higher percentages of their ranks among the poor.The census figures do not delve into immigration status -- whether someone is here legally or illegally. Some critics of illegal immigration contend that U.S. taxpayers should not be liable for the medical costs of anyone in the country illegally. This fact-check makes no attempt to wade into that controversy.Children – defined by the census as people under 18 – also are more likely to be in poverty than any other age category. The most recent figures indicate 20.7 percent of young people meet the federal definition of poverty.Census figures tie together poverty and a lack of insurance.The percentage of all people without insurance rose from 15.4 percent in 2008 to 16.7 percent in 2009, according to a report released late last year. Thats 50.7 million people without insurance.Broken down by race or ethnicity, the census calculates that 32.4 percent of Hispanics are uninsured. Thats significantly higher than blacks (21 percent), Asians (17.2 percent) or whites (12 percent).Not surprisingly, income affects insurance rates. Nearly 27 percent of people making $25,000 a year or less are uninsured, according to the census.So, the poor are more likely to be uninsured and Latinos are more likely to be uninsured. But is the number correct?We contacted the Kaiser Family Foundation, which acts as a clearinghouse for health-related data, to see if the figure quoted for Georgia is correct. According to foundation spokesman Chris Lee, it checks out – or comes very close.Lee said the figure they came up with is 41 percent even, using a three-year average of census data.Ngandu said La Raza used the same source to get its figure. In terms of raw numbers, thats about 120,000 Latino children in the state relying on Medicaid for health care.Medicaid is a federal program administered -- and jointly funded -- by the states that provides medical care to low-income people and the disabled, although eligibility varies by state. It covers a wide range of health-related costs, from doctors visits to nursing home care.Nationally, the states and federal government put about $339 billion into Medicaid, with the federal government picking up 57 percent of the total cost, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation.The program costs Georgia $1.7 billion, and that figure is expected to climb with a planned federal expansion of the program that would add an estimated 650,000 people in 2014. The Kaiser Family Foundation estimates the additional costs to be around $714 million, while the governors office has projected the cost of the expansion at $2.5 billion over the next decade.Currently, about one in six Georgia residents is enrolled in Medicaid, and most of those are children. La Raza is highlighting the high percentage of Latino children on the Medicaid rolls as an argument against cutting the program to lower the federal deficit.Thats a subject for political debate, not PolitiFact. For the purposes of this fact-check, the number in the WABE broadcast appears to be on target.",1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,true

Final Rating: True  ",Texas leads the nation in the percentage of residents without health insurance.,"In a Jan. 6 New York Times op-ed column, liberal economist Paul Krugman warns that Texas is the future, and it isnt pretty: What were seeing right now is a future that doesnt work. Among his charges is that Texas is leading the nation in the percentage of residents without health insurance, the column says.  Texas has so long been cited as the state with the highest percentage of uninsured residents that factual corroboration seldom follows. When we asked Krugman for backup, he pointed us to 2007-2009 data from the U.S. Census Bureau comparing the percentage of uninsured residents between states. According to to the bureaus estimates, Texas ranked first at that time, with 25.5 percent uninsured. New Mexico followed, with 22.6 percent, and then Florida, 20.9. Nationally, 15.8 percent were uninsured, according to the data, with Massachusetts having the fewest uninsured, 5.1 percent.  An October 2008 policy paper by the conservative Texas Public Policy Foundation notes that Texas has the unfortunate distinction of leading the nation in the number of uninsured citizens, but takes issue with the Census Bureaus methodology, which includes anyone uninsured at the time the survey is taken.  Separately, we found a national poll indicating Texas ranked No. 1 in uninsured residents the first half of 2010. According to the Gallup poll, an average of 26.8 percent of Texas residents were uninsured. Mississippi trailed in second (25.8 percent), followed by Louisiana (24 percent). California landed fifth, with 21.9 percent. And Massachusetts, which requires residents older than 18 to have health coverage, ranked again as the state with the smallest percentage of uninsured residents: 4.9 percent. Gallup said it interviewed 176,193 adults from Jan. 2-June 30, 2010.

Final Rating: True  ","Currently, 23 percent of our military's infrastructure is graded as 'poor' while 9 percent is 'failing.'","North Carolinas 3rd Congressional District, in the eastern part of the state, is home to several military bases, including Camp Lejeune, New River and Cherry Point. So its no surprise that, with a special election for the U.S. House heating up, the candidates in the primary are talking a lot about the military. We also need to adequately provide for our military families via increased infrastructure projects, said Democrat Allen Thomas in a pre-election candidate questionnaire with the Jacksonville Daily News. Currently, 23 percent of our militarys infrastructure is graded as poor while 9 percent is failing. We wondered if Thomas had his numbers straight, so we decided to put his claim to the Truth-O-Meter. It turns out hes correct. Thomas did not respond to requests for comment, but he likely got his statistics from a budget request that Lucian Niemeyer, assistant secretary of defense for energy, installations and environment, provided to the House Committee on Armed Services on April 18, 2018. Noting that the Department of Defense needs a steady flow of investment to keep its bases in good condition, Niemeyer requested more money for the 2019 fiscal year to compensate for low funding in past years. As a result of limited investments in previous budgets for facilities sustainment and recapitalization, 23 percent of the Departments facility inventory is in poor condition  and another 9 percent is in failing condition, Niemeyer said in prepared testimony. Infrastructure is a broad term. In this context, it seems to refer primarily to the buildings on military bases. Pentagon spokeswoman Heather Babb confirmed the numbers in the budget request are accurate. For what its worth, the DOD budget President Donald Trump ultimately proposed for 2019 was more than $686 billion, with about $10.8 billion devoted to maintenance and repair for facilities. Thomas said, Currently, 23 percent of our militarys infrastructure is graded as poor while 9 percent is failing. These numbers are in line with what the Department of Defense reported to Congress last year.

Final Rating: True",Says people convicted of felonies or under restraining orders can buy a firearm without going through a background check.,"Gun control is yet again — tragically — up for debate in Wisconsin. After mass shootings at an El Paso Walmart and a Dayton, Ohio, entertainment district left 31 dead, Wisconsin leaders have raised questions about loopholes in state law. Democratic lawmakers introduced legislation in August 2019 that would require background checks for nearly all gun sales. Gov. Tony Evers, a fellow Democrat, has threatened to call a special session on the matter if Republican legislative leaders dont take up the bill. This comes as 80% of state residents support universal background checks — including 75% of gun owners — according to a Marquette University Law School Poll conducted in mid-August. So how is that different from what Wisconsin has now? The states Democratic attorney general offered an example. Because we dont have universal background checks, people who are a danger to others — including people who have been convicted of a dangerous felony or are subject to a domestic violence restraining order — currently can buy a firearm without going through a background check, Josh Kaul said in an Aug. 15, 2019, tweet. State Sen. Jennifer Shilling, D-LaCrosse, raised the same point with a tweet earlier that day. Can someone in those circumstances really purchase a gun without a background check? A convicted felon, or someone with an active restraining order connected to domestic violence, would not pass a criminal background check to qualify for a firearm purchase. Such background checks are required under federal law for any purchase of a firearm from a Federal Firearm Licenses dealer — which would include any retailers or others engaged in gun sales as a profession. In Wisconsin, the state Department of Justice handles background checks for handgun sales, while long gun sales go through the National Criminal Background Check Systems, said DOJ spokeswoman Gillian Drummond. This two-pronged system covers the vast majority of firearm purchases in the state, Kaul said in anAug. 9, 2019, appearance on Wisconsin Public Televisions Here and Now. This is the process gun rights advocates refer to when noting background checks already exist. But its not the only way to buy a gun. A 2015 study found 22% of gun owners bought their most recent firearm without going through a background check. Thats because gun sales in Wisconsin between private parties (those without a federal firearms license) arent subject to reporting, waiting period or background check requirements. The U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives does not regulate private sales as it does those involving dealers. And Wisconsin is one of 29 states that does not impose any state-level regulations either, according to the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence, a research and advocacy organization that seeks laws, policies, and programs proven to save lives from gun violence. Websites such as Armslist — a Craigslist-style firearms marketplace — connect private sellers and are heavily used. A search in September 2019 showed more than 2,000 firearms for sale from private parties in Wisconsin.  Two guns used in high-profile shootings here were purchased through Armslist by people under court orders not to possess guns. In October 2012, Radcliffe Haughton killed three people including his estranged wife and injured four others, before killing himself at Azana Salon & Spa in Brookfield. A day before the shooting he purchased a .40-caliber handgun in the parking lot of a Germantown McDonalds after connecting with the seller on Armslist. Two days before that, a judge had issued a restraining order that barred Haughton from owning a gun. In January 2018, Robert Schmidt bought a Glock 9 mm handgun from a 19-year-old man through Armslist, days after he was released from the Calumet County jail on a bond that prohibited him from having a gun. The transaction took place in a Walmart parking lot. Schmidtwas charged at the time with raping his wife at gunpoint. The next night he used that gun tokill his wife and then himself at a home just outside Appleton. Kaul said felons and people subject to domestic abuse restraining orders are currently able to buy guns in Wisconsin without going through a background check. All purchases from firearms dealers are subject to state and federal requirements that include a criminal background check. But Kaul is right that Wisconsin is among the states with no oversight of gun sales between private parties. That has allowed people in the circumstances he described to buy guns, in some cases with tragic results.",1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,true

Final Rating: True  ",Says Paul Ryan is still endorsing Trump.,"One of the most vexing quandaries for Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan in 2016 has been whether, and how, to support the GOPs presidential nominee. Finally, a month from election day, Ryan somewhat reluctantly agreed to make his first public appearance with Donald Trump, at a political rally in his southern Wisconsin district. But on the day before rally, a videotape of Trump talking crassly about women surfaced. In the 2005 video, Trump is caught on a live microphone saying I did try and f--- her. She was married. He also uses graphic terms to describe the womans body and says he frequently tries to kiss beautiful women and even grab their genitals. Ryan denounced Trump and said Trump would not be attending the rally. Three days after the videos release, on Oct. 10, 2016, Ryan went further, declaring to fellow Republican House members he would not defend Trump, and instead focus on maintaining the GOPs majority in the House. So, we wondered about a tweet issued the same day by Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton. She claimed: Ryan is still endorsing Trump. Ryans position Ryans dilemma on supporting Trump was evident in May 2016, when we tested him on our Flip-O-Meter, which is used to see whether a politician has changed positions. We gave Ryan a Half Flip. At the time, just after Trump became the presumptive GOP nominee with a win in Indianas primary, Ryan had said repeatedly he would support for president whomever won the Republican nomination. He said so even when asked specifically about Trump. Yet in his first comments after Trump won in Indiana, Ryan wavered. He did not say he would not support Trump. But he stated he was not ready to support him at that time. Then in June 2016, a month before Trump won the nomination, Ryan endorsed him, saying: It's no secret that he and I have our differences. I won't pretend otherwise. And when I feel the need to, I'll continue to speak my mind. But the reality is, on the issues that make up our agenda, we have more common ground than disagreement. Clintons claim Early on Oct. 10, 2016, Politico reported that, according to sources, Ryan was discussing whether to revoke his Trump endorsement. Clinton sent her tweet several hours later, after Ryan held a private conference call with House Republicans that was later discussed publicly. Clintons campaign cited to us a same-day blog post from the Los Angeles Times about the call. The post was headlined: House Speaker Paul Ryan will not campaign with Trump, but still endorses him. Other news accounts on the conference call were similar. The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel stated Ryan stopped short of rescinding his own tepid endorsement of Trump, and quoted a Ryan aide as saying there is no update in his position on Trump at this time. The New York Times and ABC News said Ryan responded to criticism for not supporting Trump more by emphasizing that he wasn't withdrawing his endorsement. As for Ryan himself, when we asked his campaign about Clintons claim, a spokesman simply reiterated what had been put out earlier, saying: There is no update in his position at this time. Our rating Clinton says Ryan is still endorsing Trump. As of the time when Clinton made the claim, Ryans endorsement of Trump for president remained in place. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/82b74708-0ee4-414b-9fb4-437544a96b41",1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,true

Final Rating: True  ",(Ronald Reagan) raised taxes a billion dollars in his first year as governor of California.,"As the candidates fell over themselves in a game of I-loved-Ronald Reagan one-upsmanship during a Jan. 10, 2008, debate in South Carolina, Mike Huckabee had the audacity to note that in Reagan's first year as governor of California, the Gipper raised taxes. A lot. You know, if Ronald Reagan were running tonight, there would be ads by the Club for Growth running against him because he raised taxes a billion dollars in his first year as governor of California, Huckabee said. It would be $10-billion today. Ronald Send the welfare bums back to work Reagan? Basically, yeah, said Kelly Barton, an archivist at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in Simi Valley, Calif. In the summer of 1967, during Reagan's first year as governor, and contrary to his campaign promises, Reagan signed off on a record tax increase for the state of California — an 18 percent, roughly $1-billion hike. According to Reagan biographer Lou Cannon, the increase included boosting sales taxes from three to five cents on the dollar; raising the maximum income tax from 7 to 10 percent; and increases in bank, corporation, inheritance, liquor and cigarette taxes. A little context is in order. In his autobiography,An American Life,Reagan said he inherited a $200-million deficit from his predecessor, Pat Brown. Reagan ordered a hiring freeze and other spending cuts. But Reagan was a Republican governor in a state where the legislature was controlled by the Democrats, and he wasn't able to muster support for additional cuts. So, he ended up reluctantly signing off on the tax increases. This is the second time in week that a Republican candidate has used Reagan to defend himself. In a debate on Jan. 5, 2008, Rudy Giuliani correctly pointed out that Reagan had endorsed a policy of amnesty for some illegal aliens. Read our rulinghere. Now, Huckabee's math may be a little off on what that $1-billion would translate to today. It's actually closer to $6.3-billion. But the bottom line, Huckabee's statement about Reagan is true.

The e-mail lists 10 items about McCain, beginning with the statement, His carefully crafted positive image relies on people not knowing this stuff — and you might be surprised by some of it. The fourth item on the list states, McCain opposes a woman's right to choose. He said, 'I do not supportRoe vs. Wade. It should be overturned.'  MoveOn is on solid ground here. McCain calls himself prolife. During the primaries in 2007, he asserted several times that he thoughtRoe vs. Wadeshould be overturned, and that message is featured prominently on McCain's campaign Web site. John McCain believesRoe vs. Wadeis a flawed decision that must be overturned, and as president he will nominate judges who understand that courts should not be in the business of legislating from the bench, the Web site states. Constitutional balance would be restored by the reversal ofRoe vs. Wade, returning the abortion question to the individual states.

Final Rating: True  ",Georgia is the second-fastest growing state for international tourists.,"Who needs the Statue of Liberty to draw tourists when you have the Big Chicken?Georgias new economic development commissioner, Chris Cummiskey, surprised us when he made this claim during a recent state budget hearing:We are the second-fastest-growing state for international tourists.Virginia, the commissioner said, is first.So Georgia had a greater increase in international tourists than New York, home to Broadway, Lady Liberty and the amazing Manhattan skyline? The Peach States tourism market is growing faster than the market in California, the land of Hollywood and Disneyland? Georgia is ahead of Florida, where you can sunbathe in February on South Beach?Really?AJC PolitiFact Georgia went searching for answers.Georgia Economic Development Department spokeswoman Alison Tyrer directed us to a 2009 study by the federal government about international tourism broken down by each state. In 2008, an estimated 634,000 international tourists came to Georgia, according to the U.S. Department of Commerces International Trade Administration. About 689,000 international tourists visited the Peach State the following year, the federal agency reported. Thats nearly a 9 percent increase. A survey examining international tourism in 2010 has not been done yet, the ITA said.The top markets for international tourists who visited Georgia were the United Kingdom, Germany, the Caribbean, the Netherlands, France and Brazil, according to an ITA spokeswoman. In Atlanta, the tourists like to go to attractions such as the Georgia Aquarium. They also enjoy the Georgia coastline and are curious about the states antebellum architecture.Virginia had a 16 percent increase, according to the study. New York, Florida, California, Nevada and Hawaii ranked first through fifth in the number of international tourists, but only two of those five states (Florida and Hawaii) actually had more international tourists in 2009 than 2008, the ITA found. Hawaii had a 2 percent increase, while the number of international tourists who visited Florida increased by 1 percent.The ITA report found Atlanta had the greatest percentage increase of international tourists of the nations top 20 markets.Georgia is well-known as a state that hosts many conventions. But we also know Georgia has Atlantas Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport, the worlds busiest airport. So we wondered, perhaps, if these tourists were visiting the area overnight and whether the ITAs numbers were deceptive. An ITA spokeswoman said the agency did not have specific data for how long people stayed in Georgia. An Atlanta Convention and Visitors Bureau spokeswoman said the average tourist stays in Atlanta about two or three days.So whats bringing these international tourists to Georgia? Cory Churches, the ITA spokeswoman, believes part of the explanation may be the merger of Delta Air Lines with Northwest Airlines in 2008.Delta Air Lines has been enhancing its ATL [Atlanta] hub presence, including international routes, since the merger with Northwest, Churches said.Delta has been eager to have more international flights, said Lauren Jarrell, the communications director for the Atlanta Convention and Visitors Bureau. The Atlanta Journal-Constitution has reported Deltas desire to have 50 percent of its business be the more lucrative international flights. Jarrell said more conventioneers are coming from outside the country. For example, Jarrell said 56 percent of the attendees to one convention were international.Tyrer, the state economic development spokeswoman, said Deltas push for more international flights has helped. She also said the department has been more aggressive in marketing Georgia in other countries, particularly China and Germany, as a tourist destination. Georgia has had a tourism representative in the U.K. for about 10 years, Tyrer said.The numbers in the federal report accurately reflect what the commissioner told state lawmakers in the budget hearing.",1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,true

Final Rating: True  ",Says that the new financial services law requires 358 regulatory filings.,"The morning after Republicans won House of Representatives control in last weeks elections, soon-to-be House Speaker John Boehner of Ohio held a news conference where he outlined upcoming GOP priorities for the next Congress.How about those tax cuts implemented under President Bush? He wants to keep em!What about the health care reform bill adopted under President Obama? He wants it repealed!The congressman from West Chester was more circumspect when asked about potential changes to a financial services reform package adopted earlier this year, promising merely to exercise oversight over its implementation.The law, signed by Obama in July, established an independent consumer bureau within the Federal Reserve to protect borrowers against abuses in mortgage, credit card and some other types of lending. It also gave government new power to seize and shut down large, troubled financial companies.I think when it comes to the financial services bill and the 358 regulatory filings required under that bill, that its going to require a significant amount of oversight, so that not only will Congress understand, but the American people will understand, just what this bill will do to our financial services industry, Boehner answered.That sounded like an awful lot of regulatory filings, so we asked Boehners office where his statistic came from. Staffers pointed to a U.S. Chamber of Commerce websitethat expresses the groups dismay with the legislation:The Financial Regulatory Reform bill doesn't address the core causes of the financial crisis, it says. Instead, it adds new regulatory agencies to the already antiquated system and grows a bloated, ineffective bureaucracy while leaving critical areas unaddressed, including the future of Freddie and Fannie. The real impact of the bill will depend on its implementation. The legislation requires regulators to issue at least 355 new rules and conduct 47 studies and 74 reports that could lead to additional rules.Thats not exactly Boehners number, but its close enough.A July 15 news release from the Chamber goes even further, citing a study that says the bill creates 533 required regulatory rulemakings, 60 studies, and 93 reports.A spokesman for Senate Banking Committee chairman Chris Dodd of Connecticut confirmed the bill imposes more regulation on Wall Street, but said the committee has not tallied up the exact number. He didnt dispute Boehners statistics..These regulations are long overdue, said Dodd spokesman Sam Gilford. The financial crisis occurred because there were gaps in the regulations.Democrats cite a recent Gallup Poll to explain why Boehner said hed exercise oversight over the financial services bill rather than seek its repeal. The poll found that six in 10 Americans approve of the legislation, in contrast to the majority that disapprove of 2009 economic stimulus package, the auto industry bailout, health care reform, and -- most of all -- the 2008 banking industry bailout.So, while Boehners 358 might not be right on the money, his underlying point is correct. The new law does create a lot of new regulations for the financial services industry.We find Boehners statement to be True.",1.0,0.0,1.0,0.9,0.0,0.1,0.2,1.0,1.0,true

Final Rating: True  ","Under the compromise tax agreement, 99.7% of American families will not pay 1 nickel in an estate tax.","While the debate over the compromise tax agreement proposed by President Barack Obama has focused mostly on Bush's income tax cuts and whether they ought to be extended to wealthy Americans, the issue of estate taxes has also become a sticking point for some legislators.Under the plan, the estate tax rate would be set at 35 percent, with an effective exemption of $5 million.Many Republicans had hoped to do away with the estate tax altogether, and Democrats last year had proposed a higher rate: 45 percent on the value of estates over $3.5 million.The compromise has ruffled feathers on both sides of the aisle. Sen. Jim DeMint, R.-S.C., for example, said he would not support the plan because he considered the estate tax compromise a tax increase. We ruled that claim Barely True.Meanwhile, Sen. Bernie Sanders, an independent from Vermont and a self-described democratic socialist, sent out a message via Twitter on Dec. 13, 2010, saying that under the estate tax plan, 99.7% of American families will not pay 1 nickel in an estate tax. This is not a tax on the rich, this is a tax on the very, very, very rich.According to an analysis by the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center, Sanders is correct.The Tax Policy Center estimated that about 99.7 percent of estates were exempt from the estate tax in 2009 when the first $3.5 million of an estate was exempt. Even fewer people would be subject to the tax if the threshold is increased to $5 million, as proposed in the compromise tax plan.Under the compromise plan, less than 2/10 of 1 percent of estates would be subject to the estate tax next year, said Bob Williams of the Tax Policy Center. That means more than 99.8 percent would be completely exempt.The Tax Policy Center estimates that about 3,600 estates would be subject to the tax under the $5 million threshold. Those 3,600 estates would have to pay an estimated $11.4 billion in estate taxes under the compromise tax plan.Estate tax rates have fluctuated through modern history. In 2001, President George W. Bush signed a plan to gradually reduce the estate tax from 55 percent to 45 percent, while at the same time increasing the exemption value from $1 million in 2002 to $3.5 million in 2009. The estate tax disappeared altogether in 2010.But the Bush plan only had a 10-year window because Republicans didn't have the votes at the time to permanently abolish the estate tax. It passed the Senate under budget reconciliation, which requires only a simple majority of 51 votes but which also limited it to a 10-year shelf life. Barring a new tax agreement, the rate was set to revert next year to a 55 percent rate with an effective exemption of $1 million.Last year, Democrats proposed a plan to permanently set the estate tax rate at 2009 levels -- 45 percent on the value of estates over $3.5 million. But the plan never reached a vote in the Senate. Had that plan gone through, the Tax Policy Center estimates it would have subjected 6,460 estates to a tax (bring in an estimated $18.2 billion). If no tax plan passes, and the rate goes back to 55 percent on the value of estates over $1 million, an 43,540 estates would have to pay (bringing in an estimated $34.4 billion next year).Sanders was correct that in 2009, when the effective exemption was $3.5 million, about 99.7 percent of all estates were exempt and didn't pay anything. The compromise plan -- which would set effective exemption at $5 million -- would push the number of exempted estates even higher, so that more than 99.8 percent of estates would not pay anything.",1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,true

Final Rating: True  ",The average (Wisconsin) residents tax burden is at its lowest level in nearly 50 years while incomes continue to grow.,"Is Wisconsins tax burden at a 50-year low? That was the claim made by state Sen. Roger Roth, R-Appleton, when he gave the GOP response to Gov. Tony Evers 2020 State of the State speech. In the Jan. 22, 2020, speech, Roth touted Republican-backed investments in the states infrastructure, worker training and childhood education. The results, he said, are economic growth, low unemployment, higher wages and frozen college tuition without raising taxes. The average residents tax burden is at its lowest level in nearly 50 years, while incomes continue to grow, he said. Is he right? When asked for backup, Roths office pointed us to the Wisconsin Policy Forums January 2020 report, Tax Burden Falls Again. The report is an annual review of state and local taxes relative to state residents income. The Wisconsin Policy Forum is a nonpartisan research organization. The tax burden is the total share of taxes compared to income. The Wisconsin Policy Forum compiles all the state and local taxes in Wisconsin, using a variety of reports, such as the states Annual Fiscal Report, and information from state agencies. State and local tax revenue is compared relative to cumulative personal income of all income reported in Wisconsin. Those income numbers are from the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis. The forums report shows Wisconsin's tax burden for 2019 was the lowest since at least 1970, which is as far back as the organization has data. State and local taxes, combined, took up 10.3% of residents income in 2019, down slightly from 10.4% in 2018. The state has established a new tax burden low each year since 2015. Jason Stein, research director at the Wisconsin Policy Forum, noted that doesnt necessarily mean everyone is paying 10.3% of their income. Incomes and taxes vary region to region and person to person. Noah Williams, a professor of economics and director of the Center for Research on the Wisconsin Economy, echoed that point and said the policy forums approach is a reasonable one to use. The report shows overall tax burden has consistently trended down over the last 50 years, from an average of 14% in the 1970s to 11% across the 2010s. Behind the numbers The drop is not entirely the result of reduced tax collections. Indeed, according to the forum, state and local tax revenues increased by 4.5% in fiscal year 2019 — the most since 2011. So whats going on? Well, income has increased faster than average tax collections. Income has been on an upward trend since 2009. The policy forum found income grew by 5.1% in calendar year 2018, the most recent year available at the time of its report. Because income growth outpaced the increase in tax collection, the tax burden decreased. While taxes are determined by state and local governments, many other economic factors help drive income levels, Stein said. If the economys doing really well, its not purely a function of whats happening at the state level, Stein said. If it was doing really poorly, it wouldnt be purely a function of whats happening at the state level either. Roth claimed the average (Wisconsin) residents tax burden is at its lowest level in nearly 50 years, while incomes continue to grow. The numbers check out. While tax collections are up, incomes have been growing at a faster rate than taxes. Thus, the tax burden continues to edge down. ",1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,true

Final Rating: True",The Baucus bill contains provisions that would send massive federal subsidies directly to both private insurance plans and government-chartered cooperatives that pay for elective abortion.,"With the recent release of the Senate Finance Committee plan for health care reform, the abortion issue has re-emerged in the health care debate. And both sides are choosing their words carefully to score political points. We are examining two seemingly similar statements from the National Right to Life Committee that we think get to the heart of the rhetoric. One is that under the bill proposed by Senate Finance Committee Chairman Max Baucus, D-Mont., federal funds (tax dollars) would subsidize abortions; and the other is that federal subsidies would go to insurance companies that offer abortion coverage. They sound similar, but we ended up with rulings at opposite ends of our Truth-O-Meter. We take a look at the first claim, that federal tax dollars would subsidize abortions, in a separate item and conclude the statement isFalse. In this item, we deal with a statement from NLRC legislative director Douglas Johnson that the Baucus bill contains provisions that would send massive federal subsidies directly to both private insurance plans and government-chartered cooperatives that pay for elective abortion. If you look carefully, the issue here is government involvement in plans that offer abortion. And that's a big deal. The 1976 Hyde Amendment prohibits the use of federal funds for abortions through Medicaid except in cases of rape, incest or when the mother's health is in peril. So states that want to offer abortion coverage have to pay for it themselves. Similar restrictions on public funding for abortions applies to federal health care coverage extended to active and retired military and federal employees. Baucus said he attempted to find language that just maintains the status quo on abortion, because he didn't want the issue to be a distraction. This is a health care bill, not an abortion bill, Baucus said. Maintaining the status quo, however, is a matter of perception. And that's because there are two competing realities. On the one hand, as President Barack Obama acknowledged in a July 21 interview, We ... have a tradition of, in this town, historically, of not financing abortions as part of government-funded health care. In other words, the more than 250 private health plans that cover federal employees — because they are subsidized by the federal government — cannot offer full abortion services. On the other hand, many private plans (outside the government) currently offer abortion services. If the government starts providing health care subsidies but bans the participation of any plan that offers abortion services (as some legislators have suggested), abortion rights groups argue it would strip millions of women of benefits they currently get. According to a 2002 Guttmacher Institute study, 87 percent of employment-based insured health plans offered coverage for abortions (though not all companies select it for their employees). A 2003 Kaiser Family Foundation survey found that 46 percent of covered workers had coverage for abortions. The two surveys asked different questions, but the bottom line is that a significant percentage of women have health insurance that covers abortions. According to Baucus' chairman's mark, which provides a blueprint for the plan, abortion cannot be a mandated as part of any minimum benefits package except in cases of rape, incest or if the mother's life is in danger. However, health plans in the exchange or co-op would not be prohibited from providing abortion coverage. In fact, every state exchange would have to provide one plan that covers abortion and one that does not. The exchange is a virtual marketplace where people can comparison shop for an insurance plan. Baucus' alternative to a public option, a co-op, would be one alternative on the exchange (think of it as a credit union for health insurance). The plan provides federal dollars — through tax credits or cost-sharing credits — to subsidize the cost of insurance for people with modest incomes. So clearly, you'd have federal subsidies going to plans that cover abortions. But no more federal money would go to plans that offer abortion, so the added cost would presumably be passed on to consumers who choose plans that offer abortion, and efforts have been made to segregate funding so that only money from premiums — not tax dollars — would be used to pay for abortions. But if millions of uninsured people would now get insurance due to the health care plan, and some of the plans offer abortion coverage, we think it's fair to conclude the Baucus plan (or any other Democratic plan under consideration) would mean more women would have access to abortion services. That obviously doesn't sit well with National Right to Life and other antiabortion groups. Johnson said they'd like to see an amendment that would prohibit any insurer that gets federal subsidies from offering abortion services. Amendments to that effect failed in the House. The plan, as proposed, would lead to more abortion coverage, and therefore more abortions, Johnson said. The Hyde Amendment, he said, is one of the most important abortion reduction policies adopted by Congress. Not only can't the federal government subsidize abortion, he said, it cant subsidize plans that offer abortion. The Baucus bill, he said, is a big departure from where we are now. Here's Planned Parenthood's take on the Baucus plan: Planned Parenthood acknowledges that there are some compromises that need to be made to move health care reform forward, and we are willing to do so if it means more women can access affordable, quality health care from the provider of their choice. While we are concerned that the language in the Senate Finance Bill specifically singles out abortion, we understand it is necessary to move health care reform forward.As it currently stands, it is a carefully crafted compromise which assures that access to abortion would neither be mandated nor prohibited — and that women would not lose health care benefits that they have had for decades, while also addressing concerns that no federal funds would be used for abortion. In the abortion debate, nothing is simple. And as we said, words are chosen carefully. Regarding Johnson's claim that the Baucus plan would result in federal subsidies directly to both private insurance plans and government-chartered cooperatives that pay for elective abortion, we think he is on solid ground. One could argue whether or not this is a departure from making the bill abortion neutral — each side has its take on that — but the fact is the plan would allow insurers to offer abortion. And the plan includes federal subsidies to some who might choose to join such a plan. And so we rule Johnson's statement True.",1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,true

Final Rating: True  ","In 2011, more people were murdered with knives, hands or feet or clubs and hammers than with any type of rifle.","Gun-rights advocates have mounted an aggressive social-media campaign to blunt the popularity of the White Houses efforts to advance new restrictions on guns.One reader forwarded us a statistics-heavy Facebook post that echoes others weve received. It says, Facts gun control advocates dont want you to know. According to the FBI, in 2011, 1,694 were murdered with knives, 726 with hands or feet, 496 with clubs or hammers, 323 with rifles of any type. But Obama wants to ban semi-automatic rifles?We should first note that there is significant disagreement over what is, or should be, considered an assault weapon. For instance, even though the Facebook post references Obamas intention to ban semi-automatic rifles, California law already includes some types of handguns and shotguns in its definition of assault weapon.That said, well take a look at the number of deaths caused by rifles. To check the post, we looked at the 2011 edition of the FBIs annual Crime in the United States report. The report breaks down the types of weapons used in murder. These are the statistics for 2011, the most recent year available:  6,220 323 356 97 1,587 1,694 496 728 The Facebook post and the FBI stats are closely in tune. Except for a minor typo in the Facebook posts number for deaths by hands, fists or feet, the numbers are accurate.The number cited for rifles was somewhat less precise. While its true that the FBI counted 323 murders by rifles, the agency also counted 1,587 murders by an undetermined type of firearm and 97 by other guns. If gun usage in these two categories followed the same pattern as other gun homicides, that would add another 75 or so murders by rifle, making an estimate for the number of rifle murders about 400, rather than 323.Still, the larger point holds: Murders by knives, blunt objects and body parts each individually outweighed those committed using a rifle.We should note that while the Facebook posts comparison is accurate as far as it goes, it does ignore the single biggest category of weapons used in murders -- handguns. Handguns were used in 6,220 cases, or 72 percent of all firearm murders in 2011 and slightly under half of all murders using any kind of weapon that year.This caveat illustrates how the selection and framing of statistics can be used to bolster one side or the other in the gun debate.Our rulingThe post uses data selectively, ignoring the significant role of handguns in gun violence. But the statistics it mentions are solid. FBI data backs up the Facebook posts claim that in 2011, more people were murdered with knives, hands or feet or clubs and hammers than with any type of rifle.",1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,true

Final Rating: True",The House of Representatives does not have a prochoice majority.,"One of the more interesting twists in health care reform came on a recent vote in the House of Representatives on abortion coverage.An amendment restricting abortion coverage authored by Rep. Bart Stupak, a Democrat from Michigan, won the votes of all Republicans and 64 Democrats to become part of the health care reform bill passed by the House on Saturday. His measure further tightened rules about how insurers could offer abortion coverage, requiring them to offer separate policies in many instances. (Read ourdetailed explanation of the Stupak amendment here.)Abortion rights advocates should not have been surprised, said Rep. Loretta Sanchez, a Democrat from California, on the MSNBC showMorning Joe.Sanchez, who favors abortion rights, said that progressives are really angry because they believe poor women should have the choice to get an abortion if they want one.On the other hand, we have to acknowledge that the House of Representatives is not a majority prochoice, Sanchez said. And I've told that to a lot of pro-choice groups. I would count maybe about 150 prochoice votes. You need 218 to get to pass a bill.We wanted to know if Sanchez was correct that the House of Representatives is not majority prochoice.We first turned to an organization that favors abortion rights. NARAL Pro-Choice America rates members of Congress and has compiled its own profile of the current Congress. It labeled 185 members prochoice.Then we turned to the National Right to Life Committee, a group that opposes abortion. It doesn't rate the entire Congress in the same way, but the group has rated four abortion votes during the current Congress and created percentage ratings for each member. A 100 percent rating means a member fully agreed with the positions of National Right to Life; a 0 percent rating means they did not agree at all.We crunched the numbers, looking for members who never voted with the position of National Right to Life -- 185, the same as NARAL's prochoice members.Other numbers tend to support Sanchez's conclusion, but they also reveal the complexity of the issue and the fact that every member doesn't fall neatly into a yes-or-no category. NARAL labeled 203 members antichoice. National Right to Life gave only 179 members 100 percent ratings.NARAL labeled 47 members mixed choice, while National Right to Life found that 71 members voted with the group some of the time.So do those numbers add up to the conclusion that there isn't a prochoice majority in the House?NARAL spokesman Ted Miller agreed with Sanchez's comments. It is accurate to state that antichoice lawmakers outnumber our prochoice allies, Miller said in an e-mail interview. While the numbers are challenging, we have managed to win some key votes this session (family-planning vote and lifting D.C. abortion ban) by gaining support from some mixed- and even antichoice members.National Right to Life spokesman Douglas Johnson, on the other hand, downplayed the idea that antiabortion sentiment is growing in the House. His side does win some votes, he said, and the Stupak amendment was the clearest vote on abortion that we've had in the current Congress. But he doubts that Congress would overturn the U.S. Supreme Court decisionRoe vs. Wade, a major precedent establishing abortion rights.If you had a vote in the House on whether or not to overturnRoe vs. Wade, I believe that the majority would affirm that they would support it, Johnson said.In fact, a few members of Congress who voted for the Stupak amendment otherwise receive low ratings from National Right to Life. We counted 34 members who voted with the group on Stupak's amendment but against it on other issues.Indeed, the Stupak amendment represents a classic gray area: The measure does not forbid insurers from covering abortion, but it requires them to offer separate policies for people who pay for plans with their own money (as opposed to those who pay part of their premiums with government subsidies). Those who favor abortion rights say this will discourage insurers from offering coverage that includes abortion, and perhaps it will. But that's a business decision on the part of the insurers, not a government prohibition. We should add here that the Stupak amendment might not make it to the final bill, once the Senate considers its own version of health care reform.Getting back to Sanchez's statement: She said, the House of Representatives is not a majority prochoice. Her claim is supported by counts from both sides that show only 185 members are solidly in favor of abortion rights. It's worth noting that the number of antiabortion House members is less than a majority, too. But as for Sanchez's claim, she is right.",1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,true

Final Rating: True  ","Since 2008, U.S. crude oil output has increased by over 80 percent, an increase of over 4 million barrels a day. That is the fastest increase in U.S. history.","Republican presidential candidate Jeb Bush said in his recently released energy plan that the United States should take advantage of its resurgent status as a global energy superpower. Thanks to new means of extracting oil such as hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling, theres been an unprecedented spike in domestic oil production, the former Florida governor said. Since 2008, U.S. crude oil output has increased by over 80 percent, an increase of over 4 million barrels a day. That is the fastest increase in U.S. history, his plan read. Has oil production really seen the fastest increase in the nations history, topping 80 percent or higher since 2008? It sure has, reversing a decline that began back in 1986. We went to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, which keeps monthly and annual statistics for crude oil production. They said that in 2008, the United States produced 5 million barrels per day, a figure that has jumped to more than 9 million per day in 2015. A Bush spokeswoman confirmed to us that was the same data they were using when drawing up the energy plan. As you can see, thats a pretty steep spike in production over a seven-year period:  The change is largely because of the reasons Bush gave, according to EIA spokesman Jonathan Cogan. Better technology like fracking and horizontal drilling, which makes extraction from geological formations like layers of shale easier, has led to an overall increase in output. Relatively high oil prices (about $140 per barrel in 2008, as opposed to less than $50 recently) also helped lead to the ramp-up in production. You may recall that gas prices reached a single-day high in 2008, with a gallon costing $4.11 that July. The highest-ever nationwide annual average of $3.60 per gallon was in 2012. Mark Perry, a University of Michigan-Flint economics professor working with the conservative American Enterprise Institute, agreed that Bushs take is accurate. He said based on EIA numbers through July, U.S. crude production has gone up 83 percent since 2008. That bumps up to 88 percent if you measure the current 2015 average of almost 9.4 million barrels per day. (We will note that 2008 includes a storm-related drop in September, when hurricanes Ike and Gustav churned through the Gulf of Mexico and production dropped to less than 4 million barrels per day.) Its pretty clear that the production increase from 2008-15 ... has been the largest production increase ever in U.S. history in such a short period of time, he said via email. From 2009 to 2014, the increase in oil production didnt bring the price drop economists expected, Perry said. Now that oil prices have dropped so much recently, were just starting to see production back off. The latest EIA data showed production has dropped 144,000 barrels per day since July, with estimates saying its going to continue to decrease. It took a while for the price to finally catch up to the increased U.S. production, and now were in an adjustment period, Perry said. He said the slowdown was temporaryand will likely be followed by another period of increased production in a year or two when oil prices go back up above $50 and stay there. Our ruling Bush said, Since 2008, U.S. crude oil output has increased by over 80 percent, an increase of over 4 million barrels a day. That is the fastest increase in U.S. history. Thats accurate, as high prices and new extraction methods have led to a significant increase in the amount of crude oil the country produces. Depending on how you calculate it, production has gone up 83 percent through July, or 88 percent if you use the current 2015 average. Production is currently dipping downward, but its easily the fastest increase in a seven-year span in U.S. history.",1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,true

Final Rating: True  ","Seven years later, (Scott Walker) has not hit his first campaign promise of creating 250,000 jobs.","U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan blasted Gov. Scott Walkers ability to keep his No.1 campaign promise during the Democratic Party of Wisconsins annual convention. Pocan, D-Madison, attacked Walker and Republican lawmakers on job growth and other issues during his 15-minute speech, at one point focusing on the governors failed 2010 campaign promise to add 250,000 private-sector jobs within his first term. Seven years later, (Scott Walker) has not hit his first campaign promise of creating 250,000 jobs, Pocan said halfway through his June 2, 2017 speech.  The convention took place as state Democrats seek to ramp up support among its base before the 2018 mid-term elections. Walker is expected to be on the ballot again, seeking a third term. So the promise is likely to come up again  and again. Here, well briefly revisit Walkers original promise, and see where the jobs tally currently stands. The promise In 2010, Walker first sought the governors office on the promise that he would bring 250,000 private-sector jobs to Wisconsin by the end of his first term. (Scott Walker will) get government out of the way of employers ... who will then help Wisconsin create 250,000 jobs by 2015, and as we create those new jobs, we will be able to add 10,000 new businesses, his campaign said at the time. For the years 2011 through 2014, Wisconsin added 130,153 private-sector jobs, meaning Walker fell short of his first-term promise by about 100,000 jobs, according to the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages. For this tally, we used the Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages, which surveys nearly all state businesses, to get the most accurate picture for Walker's years in office. We made comparisons using the fourth quarter reports from the QCEW. The picture since Wisconsins economy has continued to add jobs throughout Walkers second term, but at a much slower pace. The fourth quarter numbers for 2015 and 2016 from the BLS show Wisconsin added 38,077 and 11,548 jobs respectively. The 2016 growth numbers were the worst during Walkers tenure and the worst since the economy rebounded after the 2008-09 recession. In total, Wisconsin has added a total of 179,778 private sector jobs during Walkers near seven years as governor, which puts him 70,000 short of the pledged 250,000 new jobs. Pocan spokesman David Kolovson said in an email that the congressmans claim was based on a March 12, 2017 Milwaukee Journal Sentinel story, which stated the governors promise remains elusive. The Journal Sentinel story listed the total number of jobs under Walker as 185,208, which differs from the total offered here because that article was published before the BLS released final numbers covering the end of 2016. Walker spokesman Tom Evenson also pointed to the same story and Wisconsin Department of Workforce Development numbers, saying in email we dont have anything to add. Wisconsins business climate has consistently improved from one of the worst in the nation to one of the best under Governor Walker, and our states economy is in the best shape its been in 16 years, Evenson said quoted as saying in the March story. Weve seen more people employed than ever before, wages are up, and Wisconsins labor force participation rate continues to be one of the best in the country. And yet, the topic of job creation under Walker lingers. President Donald Trump ran on the platform of being a jobs president, famously saying Ill be the greatest jobs president God ever created. In a June 13, 2017 visit to Wisconsin, President Donald Trump hinted at a major manufacturer locating to Wisconsin. The Journal Sentinel reported on June 15 that Foxconn, a Taiwanese company that assembles Apples iPhones and other electronics, is considering Wisconsin as the site for a 1,000-acre manufacturing plant, which could generate thousands of jobs. Our rating At the Democratic Party of Wisconsins state convention, Pocan said, Seven years later, (Scott Walker) has not hit his first campaign promise of creating 250,000 jobs. Pocan is right to say Walker hasnt hit his first campaign promise. The number of jobs created still falls short of that promise.",1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,true

Jim Justice took to Facebook in October to tout gains in his states tourism industry. When I took office, I made tourism a top priority because I knew it had all the potential in the world, Justice wrote in his post. Today I am proud to announce that West Virginias tourism industry has grown for the second consecutive year, reversing years of decline and outpacing national growth by 58%! Way to go West Virginia Tourism! The post linked to a press release that provided additional detail and cited a study conducted by Dean Runyan Associates, an economic consulting firm that has examined the states tourism industry annually since 2000. A year ago, we fact-checked how well Justice described the previous years statistics and rated it Mostly True, because Justice glossed over some of the reports negative findings. How about this year? Lets take a look, point by point. (Justices office did not respond to inquiries for this article.) This is accurate. The report found that overall spending on tourism in West Virginia grew from $4.14 billion in 2016 to $4.28 billion in 2017 to $4.55 billion in 2018. Thats an increase in the most recent year of 6.5%, easily exceeding the rate of inflation. Spending also grew for the second straight year if you set aside gambling revenue. It rose from $3.48 billion in 2016 to to $3.63 billion in 2017 to $3.91 billion in 2018. Thats an increase in the most recent year of 7.5%. This also exceeded the rate of inflation. This is accurate, too. According to the data in the report, the rise over the past two years came after four consecutive annual declines, as this chart shows:  The report also provides data for the national tourism market thats comparable to the West Virginia numbers. According to the report, spending was $980 billion in 2018, a 4.1% increase over 2017. (These figures are not adjusted for inflation, but neither is the West Virginia figure, so the national and state figures can be compared equitably.) Justices 58% figure appears to come from comparing the most recent one-year increase in West Virginia (6.5%) with the most recent one-year increase nationally (4.1%). The West Virginia percentage increase is 58.5% bigger than the national increase. Justice said, West Virginias tourism industry has grown for the second consecutive year, reversing years of decline and outpacing national growth by 58 percent. These numbers align with the findings of a longstanding annual study of the West Virginia and national tourism economies.",1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,true

Final Rating: True  ",A tax on soda and juice drinks would disproportionately increase taxes on low-income families in Philadelphia.,"Jim Kenneys proposed soda tax went national last week. Hillary Clinton led off what became a back-and-forth political battle by voicing her support for the tax at a forum in Philadelphia. Bernie Sanders chimed in later to call the tax regressive. Kenney fired back in an editorial on Huffington Post that his proposal, which would levy a three cent per ounce tax on distributors, was a corporate tax and said Sanders was siding with beverage corporations. Then Sanders responded with an editorial of his own, in Philly Mag. He basically gave an elongated version of what he said earlier in the week, which was, A tax on soda and juice drinks would disproportionately increase taxes on low-income families in Philadelphia. Is Sanders correct? Or was this political grandstanding?  Berkeley, Calif., remains the lone American city to enact a sugary drink tax. It taxes the distributors of sodas and similar beverages like sports drinks 1cent per ounce. Studies have shown some of the cost of tax has been passed on to consumers. A Cornell study found about 25 percent of it was passed on, and a University of California-Berkeley study found the amount to be between about 50 to 70 percent, depending on the type of beverage. The prices of soft drinks were more likely to go up at supermarkets than chain drug stores. Carl Davis, the research director at the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, told Billy Penn last month soda taxes like the one proposed by Philadelphia are imperfect: The first thing you realize is that it is regressive. Its going to hit lower and more moderate income families more heavily than higher-income families. William Shughart, a Utah State University professor and sin tax expert, explained taxes like the one proposed by Kenney disproportionately affect lower income residents because a greater amount of their income is used on food and drinks. Warren Gunnels, senior policy advisor for Sanders, said in an email, It would make much more sense to finance universal pre-school in Philadelphia by raising taxes on its wealthiest residents, who currently benefit from flat state and citytaxrates. Right now wealthy Philadelphianspaystate incometaxof 3.07 percent, an unemploymenttaxof 0.07 percent, and a city incometaxof 3.92 percent. Thats a total state and localtaxburden of 7.06 percent. By contrast, New York Citys wealthiest residents pay a top rate of 12.6 percent. Such a plan would be easier said than done, according to Kenneys administration. Because of the uniformity clause, its constitutionally impermissible right now in Pennsylvania to raise the income tax rate only for wealthy individuals, said Lauren Hitt, Kenneys communications director. The Republican controlled state legislature would have to change the constitution and were not holding our breath on that one. Our kids need Pre-K now. Kenney has said the tax is not regressive because he believes the money will stay in the neighborhoods. His finance director, Rob Dubow, said most consumers of sugary drinks are in poor neighborhoods. When Dubow suggested distributors would absorb some of the tax, City Council president Darrell Clarke responded, Fundamentally, I dont believe that.  Our ruling  Sanders said Kenneys proposed soda tax would disproportionately increase taxes for low income families. In the only other instance of a soda tax in the United States, studies have shown somewhere between 25 and 70 percent of the cost of the tax gets passed to consumers. Tax experts say if this tax reaches the consumer level it would affect low income residents to a greater extent.

Final Rating: True  ",Says the typical homeowner will pay $4 more per month if library district passes.,"When it comes to voting for or against increased taxes, its helpful to know exactly what the bottom line is. Just how much will this mean out of my pocket?Supporters of a new Multnomah County Library District -- the Libraries Yes! Committee -- tried to put the tax measure in some context in a recent mailer. The typical homeowner will pay $4 more per month than the amount we currently pay.We thought it was worth a quick check to see just what the measures impact would be for the average homeowner.We spoke with Liz Kaufman, who is handling media for the campaign, to see how it arrived at the $4 mark.She directed us to the measures explanatory statement written by Multnomah County Attorney Jenny Morf. In the statement, Morf wrote that If approved, the Multnomah County Library District will be formed with a permanent rate up to $1.24 per $1000 of assessed value. The typical homeowner will pay $49 a year above the cost of the current levy or $.89 per $1000 assessed value.So that extra 35 cents per $1,000 of assessed value would mean an extra $49 a year. Divide that by 12 and you get $4.08. The math checks out.Next we examined what constitutes a typical homeowner. According to Multnomah County, the median assessed home value for the county is $149,920. Homeowners at that level are paying just over $11 a month, or $133 a year, at the current 89-cent rate. That would get bumped up by about $4 to $15.50 -- or $185 annually -- if the tax district passes.We ran the numbers again, just to be safe, with the average assessed value, which is higher, about $178,000. At that number, homeowners currently pay $13.20 a month and can expect to pay $18.40 a month if the measure passes -- $5.20 more.By the way, homeowners wont see the full increase immediately.

Final Rating: True  ",The new 21st State Senate district was created in secret for Van Wanggaard. It was drawn within half a block of his house.,"Shortly after his June 5, 2012 recall election victory over incumbent Van Wanggaard was affirmed by a recount, state Sen. John Lehman (D-Racine) said it will be tough for him to win the seat again.Lehman told WTMJ radio listeners July 10, 2012, that the borders of 21st state Senate District were changed significantly by Republicans in 2011 when they controlled the Legislature. The redistricting is required every 10 years, based on updated census figures, and this was the first time in decades that one party in Wisconsin had complete control over the process.The seat is up in November 2014, and Wanggaard is expected to run.Im not surprised that hell run in the district, Lehman said. The district was created in secret for Van Wanggaard. It was drawn within a half a block of his house, around his house two blocks away then went out to western Racine and western Kenosha County down to the Illinois line.Sounds like neither Lehman nor Wanggaard should unpack their boxes.If Lehman and Wanggard face each other in 2014 (or earlier, if there is another recall), it would be the third time the two have run against each other. Wanggaard topped Lehman to win the seat in 2010. But the next time a much different mix of voters would make the choice.On July 13, 2011, the Journal Sentinels Craig Gilbert took a detailed look at the differences between the new and old 21st Senate district.The new plan goes to some extra lengths in reducing the potential for partisan competition, wrote Gilbert, author of the Wisconsin Voter blog. The most striking example is the transformation of two very competitive districts, the 21st in Racine County and 22nd in Kenosha County, into one very Republican Racine-Kenosha seat to the west and one very Democratic Racine-Kenosha seat to the east.Republicans who drew the lines have produced a plan that favors the GOP, which is certainly nothing new for political parties, the piece continued. Among the state's most competitive districts, the plan gives GOP incumbents Terry Moulton, Joe Liebham and Pam Galloway safer seats and (Alberta) Darling, (Leah) Vukmir and Wanggaard dramatically safer seats.In an earlier piece, Gilbert wrote:The Wanggaard seat would shed most of the city of Racine and some nearby areas -- wards that voted 63 percent Democratic in last fall's race for governor. (The one section of the city of Racine that's kept in the district is the one where Wanggaard lives.)Gilbert calculated that the new 21st was far more Republican, based on the vote in the 2010 governors race. Gov. Scott Walker would have won the district by 23 points, rather than 9 points in the old 21st.Now the maps borders.Wanggaard lives in the 1200 block of Blaine Ave. on the west side of Racine. The new border is 13th Ave., just south of his home. That portion of Racine -- Lehman calls it a peninsula -- lies within the new 21st district.(Indeed, Lehmans house is on Orchard St., several blocks away from Wanggaard. His house, too, lies just inside the new district.)On the in secret question, GOP lawmakers were allowed to see advance copies of their proposed district maps at the law offices of Michael Best & Friedrich near the Capitol. The Republican lawmakers -- including Wanggaard -- signed confidentiality agreements in which they promised not to disclose the contents of the maps, according to a Feb. 6, 2012, Journal Sentinel article.Our ratingLehman says the new 21st State Senate district was created in secret for Van Wanggaard. It was drawn within half a block of his house.Its common, of course, for the party in control to draw maps favorable for itself -- and the lines in question here have been approved by the courts. While the points Lehman cites may sound outrageous, even unbelievable, the record shows them to be accurate.",1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,true

Final Rating: True  ","In the past three years, we have prosecuted or brought more cases on access to public records than in the previous 12 years combined.","Rhode Island has long been a battleground in the fight for open government. Public bodies vote in secret. Deals are cut behind closed doors. Police departments withhold arrest records and daily logs. A report issued last month by ACCESS/RI found a troubling level of non-compliance with the state's open records law and called for enhanced oversight by the Attorney General's office. During an interview with Rhode Island Public Radio that aired on Oct. 2, 2014, incumbent Atty. Gen. Peter Kilmartin, a Democrat, was asked about enforcement of the open records law. He lamented that some public bodies are not following the law despite repeated attempts to educate government officials about the documents that are supposed to be public. Unfortunately, in the past three years, we have prosecuted or brought more cases on access to public records than in the previous 12 years combined, he said. That tells me there is still a problem. It's a statement he repeated on Oct. 10, 2014, during a taping of a debate on WPRI-TV with Republic Dawson Hodgson. We were interested in whether Kilmartin has brought more open records cases to court than his two predecessors, Patrick Lynch (now a lawyer in private practice) and Sheldon Whitehouse (now a U.S. Senator). When we asked Kilmartin's office for a tally of the cases, spokeswoman Amy Kempe sent us a list of 18 civil lawsuits dating as far back as 2002. There were no lawsuits from 1999 to 2002, she said in an email. According to the list, Whitehouse took one case to court, suing the Anthony fire district in 2002. During Lynch's eight years in office he filed seven suits -- against public entities in Johnston, North Kingstown, Cranston, Woonsocket and Lincoln. Barrington was sued twice. Since 2011, according to the list, Kilmartin has filed 10 suits against public entities for violating the open records law, starting with the Albion Fire District in Lincoln (which Lynch also sued) and ending most recently with the town of Warren. We spot-checked Kilmartin's cases using our archives. To check the list of his predecessors, we first contacted the offices of Lynch and Whitehouse to ask if Kilmartin was omitting any cases. Whitehouse's office said the number seems correct. Repeated inquiries to Lynch's law office produced no response. So we turned to court records and received a list of all civil suits brought by Whitehouse and Lynch against public bodies. Once again, Kilmartin's tally checked out. In summary, Peter Kilmartin said that in the past three years, his office has prosecuted or brought more cases on access to public records than in the previous 12 years combined. His office has filed 10 suits since 2011. Lynch had seven during his eight years as Attorney General. Whitehouse had just one during his four years in that office. We can't say if the trend is due to previous attorneys general being less aggressive in prosecuting violations of the state's open government laws than Kilmartin, or if public bodies are getting more brazen in ignoring them. Certainly the latest ACCESS/RI report offers evidence that the phrase open government is -- for some of Rhode Island's public bodies -- an oxymoron.

Final Rating: True  ","As CEO of WWE, Linda McMahon was caught tipping off a ringside physician about a federal investigation into illegally distributing steroids to wrestlers.","U.S. Senate candidate Linda McMahon's experience as co-founder, along with her husband Vince, of World Wrestling Entertainment has proved to be a double-edged sword on the campaign trail in Connecticut.While McMahon often touts her experience running the pro wrestling empire to boost her real-world business cred, it also has left her open to accusations that the WWE uses sexist story lines and that there is rampant steroid abuse by some wrestlers.In the final week of the race -- which pits Republican McMahon against Democrat Richard Blumenthal -- the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee has begun airing an attack ad that attempts to body-slam McMahon for tipping off a ringside physician about a federal investigation into the illegal distribution of steroids to some of the WWE's wrestlers.Read this, a female narrator begins, as a legal document scrolls in the background. It's a memo Linda McMahon wrote. Evidence in a federal trial against her company. McMahon was caught tipping off a ringside physician who was later accused of hiding evidence. It didn't work. McMahon's ringside doctor was convicted of illegally distributing steroids to her workers. That's Linda McMahon. A bad CEO. A worse senator.The memo in question -- marked CONFIDENTIAL INTEROFFICE MEMO -- was sent on Dec. 1, 1989, by Linda McMahon to Pat Patterson, a fellow executive at Titan Sports, the parent company of what was then the World Wrestling Federation. It became part of the public record as an exhibit in a steroids-related case against Vince McMahon and Titan Sports in the early 1990s.But the story actually goes back a little further, to an investigation into ringside doctor George T. Zahorian for distributing steroids to some of the WWF's wrestlers.As the 1989 memo from Linda McMahon explains, a government official let slip at a fundraising event that the State of Pennsylvania is probably going to launch an investigation into the use of all illegal drugs including steroids.In addition, McMahon wrote, this fellow mentioned that he was aware of Dr. Zahorian and his relationship with WWF.Zahorian was actually assigned throughout the 1980s to attend WWF exhibitions in Pennsylvania by the Pennsylvania Athletic Commission. But following deregulation in 1989, promoters like the WWF were required to hire their own licensed physicians to be present at events. Zahorian was scheduled to be the doctor on hand at an upcoming event in Hershey, Pa., but Linda McMahon's memo makes clear the WWF wanted to distance itself from him.Although you and I discussed before about continuing to have Zahorian at our events as the doctor on call, I think that is now not a good idea, McMahon wrote in the memo. Vince agreed, and would like for you to call Zahorian and tell him not to come to any more of our events and to also clue him in on any action that the Justice Department is thinking of taking.It's that last part, telling Patterson to clue him in about a possible steroids investigation, that forms the basis for the claim in the campaign ad.In 1991, Zahorian was charged with distributing steroids to a number of WWF wrestlers (none of whom were charged because, at the time, it was not a federal crime to use steroids, only to distribute them). He was convicted and sentenced to three years in federal prison.But that wasn't the end of the matter. In the wake of the Zahorian indictment, federal investigators opened a wide-reaching steroids investigation into the WWF. And in 1992, the government filed an indictment against Vince McMahon and Titan Sports, alleging they conspired to unlawfully provide WWF wrestling performers with steroids to enhance their size and musculature, and thereby to increase the ticket sales for WWF exhibitions and the profits to Titan and McMahon.In its indictment, prosecutors alleged Titan officials learned of a federal investigation into Zahorian's activities and warned him about it. Linda McMahon's memo was entered in the case as Exhibit #2.According to the indictment, shortly after the memo was sent, a Titan executive known to the Grand Jury had a telephone conversation with Zahorian and directed him to destroy any records of Zahorian's contact with WWF or WWF wrestling personnel. It was later learned from one of Zahorian's attorneys that after Zahorian got the phone call warning him about the investigation, he shipped files on wrestlers to his attorney's office (so they were not part of the evidence seized when investigators raided his office). But according to longtime WWE attorney Jerry McDevitt, the files were never destroyed and were later made available to prosecutors.Dr. Zahorian didn't destroy anything, McDevitt said. It was all given to the government.In any event, the government's case against Titan and Vince McMahon failed miserably. Several counts were tossed before the case even went to the jury -- including two counts alleging that Vince McMahon and the company distributed steroids to wrestlers such as Terry Bollea (aka Hulk Hogan), because the judge said prosecutors failed to establish that the alleged conspiracy occurred in the jurisdiction of the New York court where the case was filed.And on the one remaining count, that they had distributed mislabeled anabolic steroids, both Vince McMahon and the company were acquitted. In other words, none of the charges ever stuck.In an extensive story about the issue in Connecticut's The Day, reporter Ted Mann asked McMahon about the memo.I don't pretend to remember to go back, to revisit all the aspects of that case, McMahon told The Day. It has been tried, acquitted and done with, and WWE has evolved its total health and wellness policy over the years, and I'm sure will continue to evolve.According to the story:When asked if her decision to notify Zahorian had led him to destroy records that might have more thoroughly documented his sale of steroids to WWF wrestlers — as prosecutors in 1994 alleged — McMahon's reply was curt.I can't speak to any of that,' she said. I have no idea.WWE attorney Jerry McDevitt said he believes the DSCC ad is misleading, because it suggests by innuendo that Linda McMahon sought to obstruct the government's investigation.There were never any charges against Linda McMahon of any kind, McDevitt said. There was never any charge of obstruction of justice against anybody.An indictment is nothing more than an allegation, McDevitt said, and the case ended without a conviction against anyone on anything.You can only gain an acquittal in this country, McDevitt said. That's all you can do.Everyone agrees Linda McMahon was never charged with or convicted of anything, including obstruction of justice. But the ad from the DSCC doesn't say she was. The ad accuses McMahon of tipping off a ringside physician about a federal investigation into distributing steroids to their wrestlers. How else could one interpret Linda McMahon's direction in the 1989 memo to also clue him (Zahorian) in on any action that the Justice Department is thinking of taking.It's also true that a government indictment later alleged that, after getting a call from a Titan employee tipping him off to the investigation, Zahorian tried to hide evidence at his attorney's office. But whether Zahhorian tried to hide evidence may or may not be true. Zahorian sent files to his attorney, but they were not destroyed, and according to WWE's attorney, they were later made available to investigators. Nothing in Linda McMahon's memo suggests she directed the employee to tell Zahorian to hide or destroy evidence. But again, the ad doesn't say she did. The ad merely says she tipped off the ringside physician about an investigation. She did, according to her own memo. And Zahorian was later convicted of distributing steroids to some of her WWF wrestlers.",1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,true

Final Rating: True  ","For the first time in 35 years, we have more businesses dying than we do starting.","At the economic summit for Republican presidential candidates convened by Florida Gov. Rick Scott, Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., expressed concern about entrepreneurialism in the United States. For the first time in 35 years, we have more businesses dying than we do starting, Rubio said at the June 2, 2015, event. Is that correct? We took a closer look. We located a May 2014 report by the Brookings Institution, a Washington-based think tank, titled, Declining Business Dynamism in the United States: A Look at States and Metros. In that report, coauthors Robert Litan and Ian Hathaway published data that supports Rubios claim. Their calculations come from a collection of U.S. Census Bureau data called Business Dynamics Statistics. Recent evidence points to a U.S. economy that has steadily become less dynamic over time, they wrote. They found that the rate of business failures held steady, except for an uptick during the Great Recession -- but they also found that the entry rate of new firms declined by nearly half between 1978 and 2011. The precipitous drop since 2006 is both noteworthy and disturbing, the authors wrote. Heres the kicker from the report: Business deaths now exceed business births for the first time in the 30-plus-year history of our data, the authors wrote. Heres a graph showing the trend line: Technically, the crossover point occurred in 2008, so its not as if this happened in the past year or two. Still, we checked with Litan to make sure Rubio wasnt twisting the statistic in any way, and Litan responded that Rubios claim is accurate. Its true, Litan told PolitiFact, adding, We havent reversed this yet. As for the causes, the authors of the Brookings report acknowledged being uncertain themselves. However, the report added, it is clear that these trends fit into a larger narrative of business consolidation occurring in the U.S. economy --whatever the reason, older and larger businesses are doing better relative to younger and smaller ones. Our ruling Rubio said that for the first time in 35 years, we have more businesses dying than we do starting. The change didnt happen in the past year or two -- it occurred in 2008 -- but in general, Rubio has accurately cited a statistic from a respected think tanks report. The co-author of that report said he feels Rubio has stated the claim accurately.",1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,true

Final Rating: True  ",Theyve seen employer-supported coverage increase in Massachusetts after this law (Romneycare) was implemented.,"One of the defining public policy debates of our time has been about Obamacare, formally the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, passed in 2010. So PolitiFact Rhode Island was listening closely to the July 28, 2013 broadcast of Channel 12 Newsmakers, on which Rhode Island Lt. Gov. Elizabeth H. Roberts appeared. She is a leading figure in the debate, as chairwoman of the state Healthcare Reform Commission, which is charged with implementing Obamacare in Rhode Island. Providence Journal reporter Felice Freyer, one of the panelists, asked Roberts a hot-button question about Obamacare, which calls for the creation of state health insurance exchanges where individuals who dont have health insurance or are seeking an alternative to plans provided by their employers may buy their own coverage. Since World War II, employer-paid coverage has been a cornerstone of health care insurance in the United States. Any possibility that the cornerstone will crumble has been a major topic in the debate. The Obamacare exchange is scheduled to open for enrollees in Rhode Island Oct. 1. After that happens, Freyer wanted to know, might employers just cancel their own insurance -- in order to save money and trouble -- and fob off their employees on the exchange. In reply, Roberts pointed to Romneycare. That is the seven-year-old health care insurance program in Massachusetts nicknamed for former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney and often cited as the model for Obamacare. Theyve seen employer-supported coverage increase in Massachusetts after [Romneycare] was implemented, Roberts declared. I think lots of people were worried [that employers might drop coverage] but it hasnt been what has happened. Are more Massachusetts employers providing coverage now than before Romneycare? First, a little background. Obamacare requires businesses with 50 or more employees to offer health insurance or pay a penalty. In Massachusetts, a penalty that applied to businesses with 11 or more employees was in force until July 1, when it was abolished in anticipation of the implementation of the Obamacare penalty. But then implementation of the federal employer mandate and accompanying penalty unexpectedly were delayed until 2015. Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick has warned employers in his state not to take advantage of the hiatus by dropping their insurance. A trip to the website of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts Health Insurance Connector Authority, the agency that oversees Romneycare, showed that Roberts had her facts right. In 2001, well before Romneycare took effect, 69 percent of Massachusetts employers offered insurance, according to the Connector. As of 2010, four years after Romneycare was enacted, 77 percent offered insurance, the Connector says. Fresher data from another government body, the Center for Health Information and Analysis of the Massachusetts Executive Office of Health and Human Services, confirmed the trend. From 2005, the year before Romneycare was signed into law, through 2011, the percentage of employers offering insurance increased from 70 percent to 76 percent, according to a survey of employers. And a study by the independent Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation, Massachusetts Health Care Reform: Six Years Later, found that employer coverage had not decreased. When we checked with Roberts office about the basis of her statement, her spokeswoman, Maria Tocco, referred us to the Health and Human Services survey, albeit from a companion report. Nationally, according to Massachusetts authorities, only 60 percent of employers offer health insurance. Asked why more Massachusetts employers offered insurance even though an alternative had been created, Jason Lefferts, the Connector director of communications, said the business community responded to a call to duty from government when health care reform was enacted. We saw great buy-in from the business community and an acceptance that health care is a shared responsibility of the individual, business and government, Lefferts said. There was a message that everyone was in this together. The Massachusetts authorities went even further on the Connector website, to predict that as employment rebounds in their state, reliance on public sector insurance will decrease. Lefferts said the business communitys track record makes that a safe prediction. Our ruling Rhode Island Lt. Gov. Elizabeth H. Roberts said that Massachusetts has seen employer-supported coverage increase since Romneycare was implemented. Massachusetts officials have published figures that back her up. The judges rate her claim True.   ",1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,true

Final Rating: True  ","We are almost halfway to our goal of 1,000 rapes prosecuted!","Ohios March 15 primary will essentially decide the Cuyahoga county prosecutor's race. No Republican candidate is running. Incumbent Tim McGinty and his challenger, Michael C. OMalley, are both Democrats. McGintys website, McGintyForProsecutor.com, is peppered with exclamation points touting his successes since coming into office in 2012. We decided to check out some of the claims McGinty makes about his last four years. I formed one of the nation's most successful Rape Kit Task Force to eliminate the backlog of 4,850 rape kits that were untested for decades, McGinty says. Our Rape Kit Task Force will solve and prosecute 1,000 forgotten rape cases. Hundreds of serial rapists will finally be indicted. We are almost halfway to our goal of 1,000 rapes prosecuted! In 2009, Cleveland police began sending forensic evidence to the Ohio Bureau of Investigation's laboratory in response to news reports that sounded the alarm about thousands of sexual assault kits that never underwent DNA testing. When those DNA profiles match known offenders from a national database, prosecutors can file charges. But what does McGinty mean by almost halfway to our goal of 1,000, in terms of rapes prosecuted?  We asked the Cuyahoga Prosecutors Office for the numbers, and heres what they turned up, as of Feb. 9, 2016:  1,424 completed investigations 2,193 active investigations 444 indicted defendants 136 convictions (out of 149 completed cases) 91.3 percent conviction rate If the goal was to have 1,000 rapes prosecuted, 444 comes pretty close to almost halfway. But is indicted the same as prosecuted?    Yes, says Jonathan Witmer-Rich, an associate law professor at Cleveland State University. A prosecution begins when charges are filed, usually by the prosecutor, Witmer-Rich told PolitiFact Ohio. That is the beginning of the case. So it would be correct to say that McGinty is prosecuting a particular defendant even though they have not gone to trial yet or been convicted. Once charges are filed, the defendant is being prosecuted.  But can McGinty claim responsibility for the initiative to test the countys rape-kit backlog? Various media sources credit Ohio Attorney General Mike DeWine for putting out the call, over four years ago, for police departments to clear their evidence rooms of shelved rape kits and send them to the central state lab for DNA testing. This month, DeWines office marked the 10,000th sexual assault kit tested.  Jill Del Greco, the public information officer for the Ohio Attorney General, says that McGinty deserves credit. A lot more goes into it -- when we get a hit, they cant necessarily go out and make an arrest, Del Greco says. Once we obtain the DNA testing results, we return the results to the investigating agency. Witnesses have to be tracked down, she continued, and oftentimes, the victim has to be found again, too, when years have passed since the crime occurred. Its up to the prosecutors and police departments in each jurisdiction to re-boot these investigations. Our rating McGinty said his office is almost halfway to his goal of prosecuting 1,000 rapes as a result of testing a cache of thousands of previously untested rape kits. As of Feb. 9, 444 defendants had been indicted, which is nearing the halfway point of 500.",1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,true

Final Rating: True",While I was mayor of the city of Providence we had the lowest crime rate in 30 years.,"With U.S. Rep. David Cicilline coming under fire for his work as a defense attorney, the Democrat has been fighting back by saying that, during his tenure as mayor of Providence, the city logged the lowest crime rate in three decades.I'm very proud that while I was mayor of the city of Providence we had the lowest crime rate in 30 years, Cicilline said during his Oct. 16 debate against Republican Brendan Doherty, the former superintendent of the Rhode Island State Police.Cicilline talked about the crime statistics at least three times during the WPRI - Providence Journal faceoff.At the time PolitiFact Rhode Island first looked at the issue -- in 2010 when Cicilline first ran for Congress -- data were only available through 2009.Since then, PolitiFact national and its affiliates have begun looking at such statements with a focus on whether the implied cause and effect is fair and accurate. With that perspective, we decided to reexamine Cicillines claim and to include the statistics for 2010, Cicilline's last year as mayor.To recap, in 2010 we looked at data collected by the Providence Police Department on various crimes going back to 1960 and focused on the sum of all reports of murder, rape, robbery, aggravated assault, burglary, larceny and motor vehicle theft, which the police call the crime index.For 2009, the last year available at the time, there were 9,252 such crimes reported in Providence, according to police. That was the lowest number since 1965, 44 years earlier.Last week, we asked the Police Department for more recent figures.Meanwhile, we got Providence data from the FBI website. So we'll use that for now.There's one big caveat to this. The FBI and the city classify crimes a bit differently. As a result, in recent years Providence has invariably reported more crime incidents than the FBI lists on its website, even though Providence is the source of both numbers. In other words, the FBI numbers make Providence look better than the city's own numbers do. However, the trends are similar.The FBI numbers say the Providence crime index in 2009 was 9,173, or 79 fewer than the city reported.Going forward to 2010, the FBI says the number rose to 9,472, an increase of 299 incidents or 3.3 percent.However, Cicilline talked about crime rate, which is the number of reported crimes for the population. Because Providence's population went up in 2010, the crime rate in 2010 was 53.2 incidents per 1,000 people, which is lower than the year before and the lowest of any year during the Cicilline administration.(We've put the FBI statistics on a spreadsheet that can be downloaded from www.scribd.com/politifactri.) When we received Providence police's updated data, we found that the statistics for the Cicilline administration had shifted, which can happen from year to year because categories can shift, such as when an assault becomes a murder.(In two of the years, the shifts were dramatic. The new numbers were 7.7 percent lower for 2005 and 4.2 percent lower for 2007. We asked for an explanation for the discrepancies, but havent received a response from the department.)But even with those numbers, the trend remains the same, with the crime index reaching a nadir in 2009 and the number of crimes rising a bit in 2010.Looking at the broader picture, Cicilline's comments at the Oct. 16 debate suggest that he and his administration were responsible for the decline, and it was clear from when we first did the story that officials think initiatives such as community policing played a role.However, the drop in overall Providence crime came at a time that crime was dropping nationally for a variety of reasons, including the aging of the population. Thus, the evidence is muddled.One thing that argues in Cicilline's favor is the fact that the decline in the Providence crime rate was steeper than the national decline during the early years of his administration. However, that decline seemed to have leveled off during his final three years in office.Our RulingDavid Cicilline said that, While I was mayor of the city of Providence we had the lowest crime rate in 30 years.That's actually an understatement. The 2009 rate was the lowest in Providence in four decades. The rate went down just a bit more in 2010 because a population increase in Providence washed out an increase in the actual number of reported crimes.The downward trend in Providence coincides with a national decline in the rate of serious crimes, but the decline in the early years of his administration was steeper than the national average.Cicilline and the Providence Police Department may have played a significant role in bringing the numbers down as well, but the scope of that effect is impossible to quantify with any certainty.Nonetheless, the evidence is strong enough for the judges to rate Cicilline's statement True.(Get updates from PolitiFact Rhode Island on Twitter: @politifactri.

Final Rating: True  ",We spend more per student than almost any other major country in the world.,"While Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump was campaigning recently in Cleveland -- not for the first time, and surely not the last down the elections home stretch -- he made a stop at a charter school. Public schools, he said, are wasting taxpayers money. Lets run through the numbers. At the state and federal level, the United States spends more than $620 billion dollars on K-12 education each year, Trump said on Sept. 8, 2016. Thats an average of about $12,296 dollars for every student enrolled in our elementary and secondary public schools. The federal government pays for about 10 percent of the K-12 costs. The other roughly $560 billion dollars spent on K -12 education comes from the states themselves. We spend more per student than almost any other major country in the world. And were doing very poorly in terms of A-list. Back in January, Trump made a similar statement about U.S. education spending, saying we were No. 1 per-pupil by a factor of four. PolitiFact rated the statement Mostly False because it is exaggerated. This new claim is a bit more tempered. Does the United States spend more per student than other major countries? The question is, how do you define major?said Neal McCluskey, director of the libertarian Cato Institutes Center for Educational Freedom. He is a proponent of cutting federal involvement in K-12 education. McCluskey relies on data from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, a consortium of 34 member countries that share internationally comparable statistical, economic and social data. Their education statistics from 2012 were the most up-to-date available at the time of Trumps statement. According to the OECD, Switzerland spends the most per student at $15,500 per student, followed by Norway, and then the United States. Switzerland ranks first on the Global Competitiveness Index, which ranks economic strength. Norway is a not-too-shabby 11th place. The United States is third.  The United States per-student expenditure at the elementary/secondary level was 31 percent higher than the OECDs average of $9,000. It certainly is the case that we spend more than almost any country except Norway and Switzerland, McCluskey said. Very few countries outspend us in terms of absolute numbers. The United Kingdom, Japan, Germany, they all spend less than we do. I suppose you could say theyre all major. Trumps financial figures -- $620 billion on K-12 education nationally, $12,296 per student, on average -- match the totals reported by the National Center on Education Statistics. A conclusion from the 2012 Program for International Student Assessment, a test administered to 15-year-old students in 65 countries, called out the United States for high spending and underperforming. While the U.S. spends more per student than most countries, this does not translate into better performance, it read. American students scores on the test weremediocre. In math, American 15-year-olds ranked No. 26 out of the 34 participating countries. That concurs with Trumps assessment that were doing very poorly, education-wise. For a country that spends as much as we do, youd think wed have better outcomes, McCluskey said. Our ruling Trump said that in the United States spends more per student than almost any other major country in the world. Trumps assertion that U.S. taxpayers dont get enough bang for their relative buck, when our students test scores are ranked worldwide, checks out. The most recent numbers put the United States at third for government spending on education, behind Switzerland and Norway.",1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,true

Final Rating: True  ",Rhode Island spends 52 percent more per capita on human service programs than the national average.,"If you're strapped for cash, as Rhode Island certainly is, you're always looking for a way to cut expenses.One area often targeted by pundits, because it makes up such a large share of the state budget, is spending on human services such as Medicaid, which provides health care to low-income people.In April, we looked at one aspect of that portion of the budget, giving a Half True to a statement by Rhode Island Tea Party founder Colleen Conley that Rhode Island has the most generous welfare benefits in New England. (We found that every New England state, except Maine, pays more to its welfare recipients.)During the June 26 broadcast of 10 News Conference, Gary Sasse, former director of the Rhode Island Department of Administration and the business-backed Rhode Island Public Expenditure Council, made a related comparison, saying that the state gives out far more benefits than the national average.Speaking of what is now the 2012 state budget, Sasse said that of the $200-million increase [in overall spending], 90 percent is to support human service programs. We spend 52 percent more per capita on human service programs than the national average.When reporter Bill Rappleye asked for specific numbers, Sasse said, Well, we spend about $9,300 per capita on Medicaid programs, and that's soup to nuts, that's everything from RIte Care to nursing homes. The average for the country is about $6,100. There's a $3,000 difference.So the question on human services is not necessarily cutting back on eligibility, but looking at what optional services we provide. We provide about $60 [million] -- probably more than that, probably about $70 million -- in optional Medicaid services that many other states don't provide.We asked Sasse for the source of his assertion that Rhode Island spends $1.52 for every $1 spent nationally.He gave us two.The first is a Feb. 10 presentation developed by the House Finance Committee, which reported that in 2008, a total of $294 billion was spent nationally on Medicaid recipients. That averages out to $6,120 per recipient (19.4 percent of the money went to children, 13.5 percent went to adults, 43 percent was for the disabled and 24.1 percent was spent on the aged).In Rhode Island that year, the state spent $1.7 billion (about 52 percent of it federal funds) or $9,341 per recipient, with children and adults getting less (13.5 percent and 10.1 percent respectively) and the disabled getting a lot more (51.4 percent). House spokesman Larry Berman said the source of those numbers was the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation, which collects state and federal spending data.The per-enrollee spending is 52.6 percent higher in Rhode Island than the United States. Sasse said that's where his 52 percent statement came from.But what about the per capita spending?Sasse said in an interview that when he said per capita, the population he was referring to was enrollees. However, we believe most people who hear the term will think it's based on the population in Rhode Island.Would the number be different if calculated using the general population?As a second source, he referred us to RIPEC's 2010 How Rhode Island Compares report. It's based on U.S. Census data from 2008 and looks at the cost of public welfare -- Medicaid and cash payments to the poor -- on the basis of state population. That report says public welfare costs were $2,036 per Rhode Island resident, which is 51.8 percent more than the $1,341 spent per capita nationally.If you just look at RIPEC's Medicaid numbers, as the House Finance Committee staff report did, per capita spending in Rhode Island is actually 55.8 percent more than the national average, a bit higher than Sasse said.Why does Rhode Island spend so much more?We have very high residential care costs, said Sasse, a factor others have noted.In addition, Rhode Island covers some services regarded as optional by the federal government, such as adult daycare, assisted living for the elderly and hospice care for the dying.Sasse offered no specific suggestions about what to cut. He said that's for the politicians to decide; he's just looking at the basic numbers.Fred Sneesby, spokesman for the state Department of Human Services, said in April after we published our earlier item that it's important to consider other fiscally meaningful differences among states; for example, the percentage of disabled and elderly in Rhode Island is significantly higher than in neighboring states as well as the national average.He pointed us to section of the Kaiser website, StateHealthFacts.org, showing that since the 2004 fiscal year, the state's growth in Medicaid spending has been significantly less than the U.S. average. He also said that eligibility for Rhode Island programs is as strict -- if not stricter -- than Massachusetts and Connecticut.To sum up, Sasse said Rhode Islands per capita human services spending -- by his definition, Medicaid spending per enrollee -- is 52 percent higher than the national average. By that definition, hes correct.Hes also correct in the more common use of per capita -- spending by population.As often happens, our research on this item raised questions that go beyond the statement we evaluated. Chief among them: How concerned should we be that Rhode Island spends more than the national average?Advocacy groups rarely address the question directly when they offer their reports and statistics.The 52-percent figure could mean that the state is being overly generous with its benefits.Or it could mean that the characteristics of Rhode Island's population require us to spend more to give the same level of service that other states provide.Or it could mean that the national average is depressed by states that are declining to provide some of the optional services, such as hospice care for the poor, that some Rhode Islanders might regard as anything but optional.Such context would help voters and their leaders make intelligent decisions about where to attack the problem. It would also help them ensure that our money is being spent wisely on the services we want to offer.(Get updates from PolitiFactRI on Twitter.

Final Rating: True  ",Says Donald Trump supports eminent domain and the Supreme Courts Kelodecision.,"Slinging any pebbles they can find at the larger-than-life Donald Trump, some Republicans are taking the real estate mogul to task over his support for a legal concept called eminent domain. Eminent domain is the governments power to seize private property in order to make way for public development projects, such as highways or schools. Some conservatives oppose eminent domain because they see it as a breach of property rights. A recent ad by Club for Growth, a conservative anti-tax group, attacks Trump for his support of the practice and a related 2005 Supreme Court decision. The Supreme Courts Kelo decision gave the government massive new power to take private property and give it to corporations, the ads narrator says. Conservatives have fought this disaster. Whats Donald Trump say about the decision? The narration cuts to audio of Trump giving an interview to Fox News. I happen to agree with it 100 percent, Trump said. The narration picks back up: Trump supports eminent domain abuse because he can make millions while we lose our property rights. Is Trump an eminent domain supporter, and does he agree with the Kelo vs. New London, Conn. decision that many conservatives deride? Club for Growth described it as eminent domain abuse -- but whether the practice counts as abuse is a matter of opinion. Trump and Kelo The 2005 Kelo case concerned the government of New London, Conn., which wanted to seize several privately owned homes in order to open up the area for a major commercial development project intended to revitalize the struggling city. Several residents who didnt want to lose their homes, including a nurse named Susette Kelo, sued and argued that this proposal went beyond the governments eminent domain powers. In a liberal majority 5-4 decision, the Supreme Court found in New Londons favor. While eminent domain traditionally involves a proposal for a public -- as in government-run -- work, this decision said eminent domain could be used to make way for private commercial development. The idea was that the development qualified as a public use because it would bring jobs and tax revenues to a blighted area. At the time, Trump said he agreed with the decision, even though it was controversial. We found the July 19, 2005, transcript of the interview quoted in Club for Growths ad. Heres an excerpt of the conversation between Trump and Foxs Neil Cavuto: Cavuto: What did you think of that decision? Was the court overdoing it with that decision? Trump: Well, it's sort of not a good one for me to say, because I noticed every article written about it said, Will Donald Trump take over your home? sort of using me as the example, Neil. And it's sort of -- it's an interesting situation to be in. But I happen to agree with it 100 percent, not that I would want to use it. But the fact is, if you have a person living in an area that's not even necessarily a good area, and government, whether it's local or whatever, government wants to build a tremendous economic development, where a lot of people are going to be put to work and make an area that's not good into a good area, and move the person that's living there into a better place -- now, I know it might not be their choice -- but move the person to a better place and yet create thousands upon thousands of jobs and beautification and lots of other things, I think it happens to be good. As Trump acknowledges, he is somewhat of a poster boy for the pitfalls of eminent domain because of a high-profile case involving his property. In the late 1990s, Trump wanted to build a limousine garage to service one of his casinos in Atlantic City, N.J., but several pieces of private property were in the way -- including a home owned by a woman named Vera Coking. When Coking refused to give her property up for Trump, New Jerseys casino reinvestment authority tried to seize the house instead. The dispute ended up in front of a New Jersey court, which ruled against Trump and the government. Media regularly cited the case as an example of failed eminent domain during coverage of the Kelo case a few years later. So Trump supported eminent domain back in the mid2000s, but what does he think of it now? His current views It appears Trump holds the same position as he did back then. On Oct. 6, 2015, Foxs Bret Baier asked Trump, What do you think of eminent domain? I think eminent domain is wonderful, Trump responded, adding that as a builder, he knows better than anybody how frustrating it can be when youre building a project, and one property holds out and refuses to sell. And you need a house in a certain location because you're going to build this massive development that's going to employ thousands of people. Or you're going to build a factory that without this little house, you can't build the factory, he said. I think eminent domain is fine. Baier pushed Trump specifically on whether he still supports the Kelo decision. Trump did not respond directly to that question, though he reinforced his support for eminent domain in general and acknowledged that his position differs from that of many conservatives. I think it's a great subject -- it's a very interesting subject, Trump said. I fully understand the conservative approach, but I don't think it was explained to most conservatives. Our ruling Club for Growth said Trump supports eminent domain and the Supreme Courts Kelo decision. As recently as this week Trump has expressed support for eminent domain, and he has in the past said he agrees with the Kelo decision, which expanded the power, 100 percent.",1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,true

Final Rating: True",Texas families have kept more than $10 billion in their family budgets since we successfully fought to restore Texas' sales tax deduction a decade ago.,"A declaration about how Texans have benefited from a federal tax deduction led Austin economist Stuart Greenfield to call for the Texas Truth-O-Meter. Greenfield asked us about the accuracy of a statement by U.S. Rep. Kevin Brady, R-Houston, in a Dec. 17, 2014, press release issued after the U.S. Senate agreed with the House to extend the ability of Texas taxpayers to deduct sales taxes on federal income tax returns. Brady, a senior member of the tax-writing House Ways and Means Committee, said: Texas families have kept more than $10 billion in their family budgets since we successfully fought to restore Texas' sales tax deduction a decade ago. Greenfield speculated the $10 billion figure was an overstatement. Congressmans back-up information To our inquiry, Brady spokeswoman Tracee Evans pointed out a news story posted online Sept. 22, 2014, by the Dallas Morning News. That story said that according to the Texas state comptrollers office, if Congress failed to extend the option of deducting state and local sales taxes, Texans would owe an extra $1.2 billion to the IRS in April 2015. Evans emailed us: If its $1.2 billion a year, extrapolate that over ten years and what do you get? In most states, the News story noted, taxpayers can deduct state income tax payments from their federal tax bill. And since 2004, Congress has let taxpayers in states with no income tax — Texas and six others — deduct state and local sales taxes instead. In 2012, the story said, 2.3 million Texas filers (about one in five) used the sales tax deduction with the average deduction for those who claimed it being $1,906, according to a September 2014 Pew Charitable Trusts report. We asked the comptrollers office about the cited estimate. By phone, spokesman Chris Bryan said its revenue-estimating experts reached the $1.2 billion figure by taking the total amount deducted by Texans for sales tax in 2012 -- $4,353,996,000 -- and multiplying that by what its experts calculated to be the average marginal tax rate that year, 27 percent. So, the calculation suggests, Texans who took the deduction in 2012 reduced their federal income taxes by an estimated $1.18 billion all together. (We ran the same numbers, starting from an IRS chart showing federal taxes paid by Texas residents in 2012, reaching the same result.) In October 2007, Evans pointed out, State Comptroller Susan Combs estimated the deduction was saving Texans $1 billion a year. Bryan told us, though, the office doesnt routinely estimate the effect of the deduction and doesnt have a 10-year impact figure. Greenfield, apprised of the comptrollers approach, said its methodology and Bradys cumulative figure seemed to add up after all. Texas tax expert: Beneficiaries tend to be higher-income earners Separately, Dick Lavine, a tax analyst for the liberal Austin-based Center for Public Policy Priorities, stressed by email that Texans at higher income levels disproportionately enjoy the deduction, which only helps taxpayers who itemize deductions. In 2012, 39 percent of Texas filers with adjusted gross incomes of $75,000 to $100,000 took the deduction; 14 percent of filers with earnings of $25,000 to $50,000 did so. Lavine pointed out, too, that Texans deducted $3.2 billion in 2004, the first year the deduction was restored, which might indicate the value of the deduction in reduced taxes over 10 years might be less than $10 billion, he said, especially if the marginal tax rate on average was 25 percent. PolitiFact estimate To reach a savings estimate of our own, we added up all the sales tax deductions claimed by Texas residents for 2004 through 2012, as reported by the IRS. A figure for 2013 has yet to be posted by the agency so we reached an estimate for that year based on averaging what Texans deducted in 2010, 2011 and 2012. All this ultimately led us to estimate the Texas deductions over the decade totaled nearly $40 billion. Next, we calculated the likely tax savings -- that is, money not paid by Texas residents to Uncle Sam thanks to these deductions. Assuming the 27 percent marginal tax rate applied by the comptrollers office to 2012, the deduction would have left $10.8 billion in Texas pocketbooks over the 10 years. At a 25 percent marginal rate, Texans money not spent on federal taxes would have amounted to nearly $10 billion ($9.998 billion, by our calculation.) Asked to comment on our calculations, Alan Cole, an economist for the Washington, D.C.-based Tax Foundation, a non-partisan tax policy research organization, emailed that he would have taken a similar tack. He also cautioned, though, that individuals who take the deduction tend to earn more and hence have higher marginal tax rates, which could justify a larger 10-year savings estimate. Our ruling Brady said: Texas families have kept more than $10 billion in their family budgets since we successfully fought to restore Texas' sales tax deduction a decade ago. While thats a squishy figure -- an estimate that cant be pinned as a fact unless you somehow divine every Texans marginal tax rate for each of the 10 years, for starters -- it appears to be reasonable. Its also so that families that had these savings were mostly better off; lower-income taxpayers tend not to itemize deductions.

Final Rating: True  ",Says he has issued more pardons than any Wisconsin governor in contemporary history.,"During his eight years in office, former Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, a Republican, did not issue a single pardon. In contrast, his successor – Democrat Tony Evers – touts every one he grants. Last week, I granted another 54 pardons, bringing our total to 391 — more than any Wisconsin governor in contemporary history, Evers said in a Jan 13, 2022, news release. On Feb. 7, 2022, he issued another release, setting the number at 416. Pardons, of course, can restore certain civil rights and privileges and relieve some legal issues. They differ from clemency or sentence commutations, which would allow a person to leave prison early. Pardons under Evers have included low-level drug dealers, long-ago drunk driving cases, mistakes made as youth and more. Among other things, a pardon can make it easier for people to get jobs. Is Evers right that the number is the most in contemporary history? The key word in Evers claim, of course, is contemporary. Evers spokeswoman Britt Cudaback said in a Feb. 1, 2022, email that the governors office looked at the past 40 years. They also said they considered Evers contemporaries to be any previous governors still living today. In that timeframe, only Gov. Jim Doyle, a Democrat, came close to granting the same number of pardons — 326, according to the Wisconsin Legislative Reference Bureau. But he did it over eight years in office. Here is a look at how various governors compare: Looking beyond that 40-year period, Gov. Patrick Lucey, a Democratwho served from 1971 to 1977, issued at least 392 pardons. We say at least 392 because tracking pardons requires reviewing Senate and Assembly journals or records held with the Wisconsin Secretary of State. And the exact figure for each governor may vary depending on who collected the information and how it was done. For instance, numbers of pardons issued per governor provided by Evers differed from those provided by the Wisconsin Legislative Reference Bureau. The governors office said Lucey issued 457 pardons through his six years in office. The bureau says the number was 392. For our figures, we are relying on the reference bureau, which compiles information on pardons, commutations and reprieves through the past couple years. The bureau has an ongoing effort to tabulate historical information on the use of executive clemency throughout all Wisconsin history. To find a governor who issued more pardons than Evers or Lucey, you would have to go back to Gov. Julius Heil, a Republican, who served from 1939 to 1943. At the time, Wisconsin governors served two-year terms. In his first term, Heil granted 486 pardons and another 448 in his second term, for a total of 934, according to the Legislative Reference Bureau. Evers said hes issued the most pardons in Wisconsin contemporary history. As of Feb. 7, 2022, Evers had issued 416 pardons. In the last 40 years, only Doyle came close to granting the same number of pardons — 326. To find a governor who issued more, youd have to go back to Julius Heil, whose term ended 79 years ago.

Final Rating: True  ",Says his release of 33 years of tax returns is more than any presidential candidate in history.,"Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush released 33 years of tax returns, casting it as the high water mark of transparency for presidential hopefuls. Today, Im releasing 33 years of tax returns – more than any presidential candidate in history, Bush said on his website. He also bragged about it on Twitter. The returns run from 1981 to 2013. We wondered if Bushs 33 years was indeed the most ever, and that does appear to be the case. We also found its highly unusual for a candidate to share so many returns, especially so early in the campaign. The previous record was held by Sen. Bob Dole, R-Kan., who won the Republican nomination to run against President Bill Clinton in 1996. In January of that year, Dole released 29 years of tax returns, stretching from 1966 to 1994. He added 1995 in April, for a grand total of 30 years. Most of Doles ire at the time was directed at primary rival, publisher Steve Forbes, who was reticent about revealing his finances. Dole took the opportunity to rebuke his opponent for pushing for a flat tax. The next highest number of releases was Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., who released a total of 20 years of returns: five years worth of returns in April 2004, adding to 15 years of returns he had revealed in prior Senate races. Critics of Kerrys campaign were more concerned that his independently wealthy wife, millionaire Teresa Heinz Kerry, wouldnt give out her returns. (She eventually provided two pages of her 2003 return.) There is no law requiring candidates to show their tax returns, but it has become common practice since Jimmy Carter became president in 1976. The releases have been far from uniform, however, down to when candidates make their returns public. Bush is an outlier for providing so many returns so early in the campaign, as the lions share of candidates usually wait until the year of the election to give out their information. The amount of documentation also has varied widely from person to person. George Romney released 12 years in 1968, as did Bill Clinton in 1992. Sen. John Edwards, D-N.C., gave out 10 when he was Kerrys running mate in 2004. The numbers then dwindle, from George W. Bush (nine in 2000) and Al Gore (eight the same year) to Sen. Barack Obama, D-Ill., and Hillary Clinton, who both released seven in 2008. Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., and Mitt Romney both released two years during their campaigns. In 1980, Ronald Reagan only provided one. Releasing tax information is often a part of campaign strategy, usually to force other candidates to reveal their finances. But even then, the move can draw criticism. Liberal political action committee American Bridge 21st Century posted a laundry list of questions about the former Florida governors business dealings on the same day he released his returns. Bushs 1,150 pages of financial documents show that the former real estate executives net worth dropped from about $2 million to $1.3 million during his two terms as governor. The campaign said he is currently worth between $19 million and $22 million. He has earned at least $29 million since leaving office in 2007. Our ruling Bush said his release of 33 years of tax returns is more than any presidential candidate in history. That really is the case. The next highest total by a presidential candidate is from Dole, who released 30 years worth during his 1996 presidential campaign.",1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,true

Final Rating: True  ","When (John) Brennan ... was asked directly  Is there any geographic limitation to your drone strike program? Brennan responded and said, no, there is no limitation.","When Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., staged his historic filibuster over 13 hours on March 6, 2013, he said he just wanted answers.He wanted President Barack Obamas administration to definitively say whether the use of armed drones could ever be justified on American soil. During his epic stand on the Senate floor, which only ended with the inevitable call of nature, Paul cited several statements made by administration officials that concerned him -- including one by CIA Director nominee John Brennan. When Brennan, whose nomination I am opposing today, was asked directly, 'Is there any limit to your killing? Is there any geographic limitation to your drone strike program?' Brennan responded and said, 'no, there is no limitation,' Paul said during the first hour of filibustering. Paul's issue was about the possibility of drone strikes in the United States. After his filibuster, Attorney General Eric Holder addressed Paul's concerns in a letter. Holder wrote that the president does not have the authority to use a weaponized drone to kill an American not engaged in combat on American soil. In looking over Paul's statements during the filibuster, we wondered: Did Paul accurately characterize Brennans answer about geographic limitations to drone use in the global terror fight? Did Brennan say there was no geographic limitation? We reached out to Pauls office but did not hear back. Still, we found three instances of Brennan addressing that issue.In a speech in April 2012 at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars, Brennan -- acknowledging the administrations drone program for the first time publicly -- said drone strikes could be necessary outside of the battlefield. At the time he was Obamas point person on counterterrorism strategy.There is nothing in international law that bans the use of remotely piloted aircraft for this purpose or that prohibits us from using lethal force against our enemies outside of an active battlefield, at least when the country involved consents or is unable or unwilling to take action against the threat, he said.In February 2013, ahead of hearings before the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence to confirm him as CIA director, Brennan reiterated that belief in response to written questions.Question: Would you support legislation to authorize the use of force outside of hot battlefields and codify the standards for the conduct of targeted strikes, including through the use of remotely piloted aircraft? Why or why not?Brennan replied: On your question about whether I would support legislation to authorize the use of force outside of hot battlefields, I believe we currently have the authority to take action in such circumstances against al-Qaida and associated forces. As Jeh Johnson, the former General Counsel of the Department of Defense, indicated in a lecture at Yale Law School in February of last year, the 2001 Authorization for the Use of Military Force does not contain a geographical limitation. Consequently I do not believe additional legislation along these lines is necessary.And in more written questions after his confirmation hearing, Brennan was again asked about geographical limits on the administrations drone strikes.He noted, in part, the government has a responsibility to protect its citizens from these attacks, and, thus, as the attorney general has noted, neither Congress nor our federal courts has limited the geographic scope of our ability to use force to the current conflict in Afghanistan.But he went on to say: This does not mean, however, that we use military force whenever or wherever we want. International legal principles, such as respect for another nations sovereignty, constrain our ability to act unilaterally. Using force in another country is consistent with these international legal principles if conducted, for example, with the consent of the relevant nation – or if or when other governments are unwilling or unable to deal effectively with a threat to the United States.We ran this issue by Paul Pillar, a former CIA official who now teaches at Georgetown University. He responded: Sen. Paul's comment is a generally correct characterization of Brennan's answer regarding the absence of any geographic limitation on the administration's authority to conduct strikes. Brennan's further remark about other considerations coming into play is a way of saying that the administration does not wantonly conduct strikes around the world, but those considerations do not constitute a geographic limitation. Our rulingPaul said during the filibuster, When Brennan, whose nomination I am opposing today, was asked directly,  Is there any geographic limitation to your drone strike program? Brennan responded and said, no, there is no limitation.We found three instances when Brennan cited legal opinion asserting no geographic limit on where the United States can use drones against terrorists. He did add that the absence of a geographic limit does not mean drones can be used whenever or wherever -- that international legal principles still apply. But we agree with Pillar that that addendum doesnt amount to a geographic limitation.Pauls characterization of Brennans comments is accurate.",1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,true

Final Rating: True  ",Things went wrong with the Medicare prescription D plan that George Bush rolled out.,"Democrats are pleading for patience as they try to reassure the country that the online insurance marketplaces critical to President Barack Obamas health care overhaul can be fixed. Big programs have seen rocky rollouts only to achieve success later, they say. Their top example:the 2005 launch of Medicare Part D, President George W. Bushs prescription drug benefit plan. Things went wrong with the Medicare prescription D plan that George Bush rolled out, Rep. Steve Israel, D-N.Y., told MSNBC on Nov. 6. When things go wrong, there are two things we can do as a country. We can spend all our time figuring out who to blame, or we can spend all our time figuring out how to fix it. Eight years after it went live, Medicare Part D is nowwidely popularamong the seniors who use it. Were there major problems with the rollout of Medicare Part D? And were they comparable to the challenges facing Obamacare? We decided to take a more a detailed look at its implementation. Strangely similar Lets play a quick game: who made this statement? This is a huge undertaking and there are going to be glitches. My goal is the same as yours: Get rid of the glitches. A Democrat in 2013? Wrong!Actually, it wasRep. Joe Barton, a Texas Republican who chaired the House Energy and Commerce Committee, about Medicare Part Din 2006. The similarities between the two health care programs, both heralded as the signature domestic achievements of the presidents who signed them into law, are at times eerie. Supporters of the laws asked for time and promised a quick fix. Critics did not mince their words. Even the lingo -- words like glitches -- has been recycled. Areport documenting the history of Medicare Part D was released earlier this year bya group of health policy experts at the Center on Health Insurance Reform at Georgetown University. It highlighted several areas where Medicare Part D struggled in its implementation that sound extremely familiar. For one thing, the Bush administration faced a difficult political battle to get the bill passed in 2003. That damaged public opinion of the law, making it a challenge to educate 43 million seniors on its nuances. Enrollment in the law was set to begin in late 2005. In April of that year, a Kaiser Family Foundation poll found that only 27 percent of respondents understood the law, while only 21 percent favored it. (In a comparable Kaiser poll in April 2013, 35 percent viewed the Affordable Care Act favorably and less than half felt they were well-informed of its details.) The Medicare site, meant to help seniors pick benefit plans, was supposed to debut Oct. 13, 2005, but it didntgo live until weeks later in November. Even then, the tool itself appeared to be in need of fixing, theWashington Postreportedat the time. Visitors to the site could not access it for most of the first two hours. When it finally did come up around 5 p.m., it operated awfully slowly, thePostreported. (Sensing a pattern?) Once seniors began to enroll, problems persisted. According to the report, the online tools had accuracy problems, and local organizations designated with assisting seniors reported problems getting necessary and accurate information. Call centers provided by the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services underestimated the needed capacity to ensure that reliable answers could be provided and service representatives were not knowledgeable or failed to provide accurate information. The Georgetown experts anticipated similar hiccups with the Affordable Care Act, noting that the countrys experience with Medicare Part D suggested the experience will be far from perfect and problems were not always addressed as quickly or as thoroughly as critics would have liked, but fixes were usually found. These days,nine in 10 seniors who utilize the program report they are satisfied with it. Theres really a striking amount of similarity even though this time its a far larger and daunting task. Its a fair comparison, said Jack Hoadley at the Georgetown University's Health Policy Institute and one of the authors of the study. Once something works its way through the problems, you forget the problems. Still different But there are important differences between Medicare Part D and the Affordable Care Act that make the challenges facing the exchanges different. Because it was aimed at seniors and e-commerce was still relatively young, Medicare.gov was not intended to be the main hub for people to purchase and review plans, said David Brailer, the first National Coordinator for Health Information Technology under Bush. The issue with Medicare Part D is there were choices of 70 to 100 plans, Brailer said. People were overwhelmed with the choices, with the options available and didn't know how to navigate and pick one. I dont remember a conversation at all blaming any IT people. This was about how do you really navigate through all these choices. Meanwhile, most people who logged on to healthcare.gov in the opening weeks couldnt even get far enough to review what options were available. Also, prescription drugs are a relatively small and easy-to-understand part of health care. Shopping for an insurance plan is more complicated. For those who did choose to enroll (in Medicare Part D) online, they checked out their options by typing in drugs they used, and once you did, you got an estimated out-of-pocket cost to make your comparisons. In the exchange world you have a full health care benefit to buy, Hoadley said. The drug cost is relatively predictable, certainly a lot more predictable than overall health costs. The challenge for this website is a lot greater, probably by a significant amount of magnitude. And theres the political climate as well. When Medicare Part D passed, Democrats were not happy with the final bill and were critical of its botched rollout. But even then, they were generally supportive of its intended outcome and worked with constituents who had difficulty signing up or utilizing their new benefits. When Medicare Part D faced early troubles, many blue states came to its rescue. The New York Timesreportedin 2006 that about 20 states, including California, Illinois, Ohio, Pennsylvania and all of New England, have announced that they will help low-income people by paying drug claims that should have been paid by the federal Medicare program. By contrast, not a single Republican voted for the Affordable Care Act, and in the years since it passed, the party has made its repeal a top priority. In the states, many Republican governors have bucked the Medicaid expansion and rejected offers to build their own insurance marketplaces, putting greater pressure on the federal government. Henry Aaron, a health policy expert at the Brookings Institute, said the opposition from Republicans has forced the Obama administration into a two-front war Bush did not have to fight. On the one hand, one must and should address the administrative problems that no one denies is plaguing the problem, he said. But youre also waging a war of public opinion against the hysterics of its critics. Our ruling Israel said, Things went wrong with the Medicare prescription D plan that George Bush rolled out. There definitely were problems, and in some cases, the parallels between the prescription benefit programs introduction and the Obamacare marketplaces are strikingly similar. While we also found some serious differences in the laws, we cant find fault with Israels fairly general statement.",1.0,0.0,1.0,0.8,0.0,0.0,0.2,1.0,1.0,true

Final Rating: True",We're borrowing 40 cents of every dollar we spend.,"Government borrowing needs to be brought back under control, and the solutions are not easy, said Sen. Kent Conrad, D-N.D., on This Week with Christiane Amanpour.The American people say, don't touch Social Security, don't touch Medicare, don't cut defense, Conrad said. That's 84 percent of the federal budget. If you can't touch 84 percent of the federal budget -- and, by the way, they also don't want to touch revenue -- you're down to 16 percent of the budget at a time we're borrowing 40 cents of every dollar we spend.So, you know, there needs to be leadership to help the American people understand how serious this problem is and that it's going to take a lot more than cutting foreign aid and taxing the rich. You're not going to solve the problem that way.Conrad was one of three senators who appeared on This Week to discuss bipartisanship. Sen. Joe Lieberman, I-Conn., and Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas, also appeared. All three have announced they intend to retire in 2012.We wanted to check Conrad's statement that we're borrowing 40 cents of every dollar we spend. We looked at whether Social Security, Medicare and defense constituted 84 percent of the federal budget in a different fact-check.We turned to the U.S. Treasury Department's Monthly Treasury Statement of Receipts and Outlays of the United States Government. For the most recently completed fiscal year, 2010, the department reported that the government had revenues of $2.16 trillion, spending of $3.46 trillion and a deficit of $1.29 trillion. Divide the deficit by the outlays and you get 37 percent, which is very close to 40 percent.We initially found the numbers a little confusing, but one of the experts we interviewed for this story explained it this way:It's like a family that earns $60,000 per year, but is spending $100,000. How are they doing it? By getting a new $40,000 loan every year to cover the difference, said Brian Riedl, a budget expert with the conservative Heritage Foundation.In rating Conrad's statement, we find he correctly described how much the government is borrowing in comparison with what it's spending.",1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,true

Final Rating: True  ","100,000 Americans died of an overdose in a single year.","Days afterthe U.S. reached 900,000 total COVID-19 deaths, U.S. Sen. JohnCornyn,R-Texas, highlighted another morbid statistic. Hetweeted on Feb. 14, We recently found out our nation hit a grim milestone: 100,000 Americans died of an overdose in a single year. He also linked this statistic to President Joe Biden's border policy and wrote, Pres. Bidens open borders policies are letting drugs like Fentanyl pour into our communities. This cannot go on - we must secure the border. Is it true that 100,000 Americans died of overdose in a single year? PolitiFact Texas took a look. Cornyn's office pointed toa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Nov. 17 newsreleaseand aFeb. 13 article by The New York Timescitingthat November release. The National Center for Health Statistics estimated there were more than 100,300 drug overdose deaths nationallyin a 12-month period ending April 2021. That matches what Cornyn said. Compared to the same period the year prior, drug overdose deaths had increased 28.5%. Data released Feb. 16 indicate an estimated 104,288Americans died from drug overdoses from September 2020 to September 2021, according to CDC media relations. Marcia Ory,Texas A&M University School of Public Health professorandco-chair of Texas A&M's Opioid Task Force, believesthat number may be an undercount. Ory said she sees that to be the case in Texas' rural counties. Texas has very few medical examiners in all of our 254 counties, so we already know that it's often a justice of the peace or someone who's not medically trained, Ory said. Because of that the symptoms of an overdose death might be interpreted as cardiac failure, respiratory problems. According to 2019 posts by the Texas Medical Association, only 15 of Texas' 254 counties have populations large enough to have a medical examiner's office. Cornyn's tweet included a video of his remarksin the Feb. 14 Senate session, where he described how opioid overdose deaths are driving drug overdose deaths and how the drug overdose death rate changed from 2018 to 2020. Scott Walters— professor at theUniversity of North Texas Health Science Center at Fort Worthanda leaderin a National Institutes of Health-backed initiative to stem the opioid crisis—said Cornyn'scharacterization of overdose deaths decreasing in 2018, increasing in 2019, and skyrocketing in 2020 was right. Cornyn's right that in 2018 we had seen a slow decrease, slow slide, of drug overdose deaths. That's absolutely true. But coinciding with the start of the pandemic, we saw a sharp increase in the number of overdose deaths, Walterssaid. When it comes to drug overdose deaths, the driver of the increase is opioid use. The CDC press release indicated deaths from opioids increased by 35% from theone-year period ending in April 2020 to the one ending in April2021. Cornyn specifically emphasized fentanyl use. Fentanyl is a synthetic opioid that, even in small amounts, can be lethal.The Department of Justicedescribesfentanyl practically and effectively 50 and 100 times more potent than heroin or prescription opioidson its public awareness webpage on opioids. Cornyn wrote in his tweet,Pres. Bidens open borders policies are letting drugs like Fentanyl pour into our communities. This cannot go on - we must secure the border. Cornyn said he believed Customs and Border Protection agents' focus on an influx of migrants hasdetracted from drug interdiction efforts. It's important to note, however, that the one-year period cited by Cornyn's office started during Donald Trump's presidency and ended roughly three months after Biden took office. U.S. Customs and Border Protection in South Texas saw a 1,066% increase in fentanyl seized in fiscal year 2021,according to a January press release from the agency. Mexico and China were the primary source for fentanyl trafficked into the U.S. in 2019,according to a 2020 report by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration. Starting with the beginning of the pandemic and the lockdown, what happened was that the normal —the so-called normal — supply routes for heroin were all pinched. It was just plain more difficult to get heroin anymore, Walters said. So people started to shiftduring the pandemic, Walters said. You saw a shift from heroin and prescription pill-based products to more synthetic products. Synthetic opioids like fentanyl, Walters said. That's responsible for the increase. Jane Maxwell,a University of Texas professor who monitors drug use patternsin Texas, said there is not a lot of data available on users, despite fentanyl'slink to many recent drug overdose deaths. While Cornyn pointed to Biden's border policy as part of the problem, Walters said he isn't sure open borders is the problem. Walters noted people have been moving substances across the border for years, and fentanyl is smaller and easier to conceal. Walters said he believes drug awareness campaigns need to be rethought. Well-established public health education tactics, like forpublic education on the dangers of smoking, assume people have a long time to use drugs before something terrible happens. That long period of time allowsmore opportunities to cut down or quit. With fentanyl, lethal doses are much smaller. It's a lot more like a poison in circulation. And we ought to be thinking more about a poison control solution rather than a stereotypical drug use campaign, Walters said. Cornyn tweeted on Feb. 14, We recently found out our nation hit a grim milestone: 100,000 Americans died of an overdose in a single year. While Cornyn did not specify which year in the tweet, the most recent data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention support this.",1.0,0.0,1.0,0.8,0.0,0.2,0.2,1.0,1.0,true

Final Rating: Half True  ",Greg Abbott defended more than $5 billion in public school funding cuts in fighting hundreds of school districts in court.,"When Republican gubernatorial candidate Greg Abbott visited a Dallas-area school district, the leading Democratic aspirant cried foul. As Greg Abbott visits a Plano ISD school today its unlikely that he will apologize to students for defending school budget cuts and fighting against their school district in court, state Sen. Wendy Davis said in a Dec. 3, 2013, post on her campaign website. Greg Abbotts actions speak louder than his words. While I fought against over $5 billion in unconstitutional budget cuts to our public schools, Davis said, Abbott wasted taxpayer funds to defend those cuts in court. Davis, a Fort Worth state senator, helped force a special legislative session in 2011 by filibustering, and temporarily delaying, a decision by the revenue-strapped Republican-majority Legislature to reduce education funding by more than $5 billion through 2012-13. And did Abbott, the states attorney general, defend the cuts in court? Thats been acknowledged. Abbott was quoted during his Dec. 3, 2013, Plano visit as telling the Dallas Morning News the reason hes defending the cuts is because the Legislature passed them and its his job to defend them. The attorney general in Texas takes an oath of office to defend the laws passed by the legislature, Abbott said, according to the News. Im fulfilling that duty. That news story came to our attention in an email from Davis campaign spokeswoman Rebecca Acuña, who responded to our request for the basis of Davis statement with a document listing web links to additional news stories as well as legal filings by Abbotts office in defending the school funding system in the latest round of litigation likely headed to the Texas Supreme Court. In February 2013, a Travis County state district judge, John Dietz, ruled the system unconstitutional, though he later reacted to legislative actions restoring $3.4 billion in spending cuts and easing mandated high-school tests by scheduling fresh hearings for early 2014, the Austin American-Statesman reported in a news story posted online June 19, 2013. A vital issue in the original trial, the Statesman said in a news story posted online Oct. 20, 2012, was the charge by two-thirds of the states school districts accounting for three-quarters of Texas students that the state was failing to ensure that districts had adequate resources to bring students up to what lawmakers handed down in tougher academic expectations. Texas districts have litigated how the state funds the schools for decades. Each time, expert lawyers told us, the state attorney general has defended the existing law just as Abbott has in the latest legal battle, which is expected to resume in early 2014. Thats in keeping with the duties of the attorney general as specified in the Texas Constitution, which says the attorney general shall represent the state in all suits and pleas in the Supreme Court of the state in which the state may be a party. Lawyers representing groups of districts in the latest lawsuits each said it would be unusual for an attorney general not to defend a state law and related legislative decisions. Buck Wood of Austin, who has long represented property-poor districts in school finance suits, said deputies to Abbott vigorously defended the law during the latest trial before Dietz. Austin lawyer Rick Gray, representing some 400 districts in the latest litigation, said he could not recall any attorney general backing down from defending the school finance system through the decades of court battles. David Thompson of Houston, who represents districts (including the Austin one) serving more than 1.8 million children, stressed that Abbotts office has defended the constitutionality of the funding system and the legislated cuts, not necessarily speaking to whether the spending reductions were good policy. The attorney generals office is actively and I would say vigorously defending the states actions, Thompson said. That would include specifically the cuts to funding as well as just the overall design and structure of the (funding) system. The lawyers each added that while its an attorney generals duty to defend the state and actions taken on behalf of the state, he or she also has discretion to settle cases. Our search of news stories and Abbott-issued press releases yielded no sign of Abbott personally appearing in the courtroom during the latest school funding trial. At our request, Catherine Clark, an administrator for the Texas Association of School Boards, reviewed her notes from the trial. By telephone, Clark said she found no instances of state attorneys defending the 2011 cuts in education aid except to elicit testimony that the reductions were less dramatic than other state budget cuts that year. I dont see them standing up there and saying, gosh, we needed to make those cuts, Clark said. But they did admit there were cuts. We asked a spokeswoman for the attorney general, Lauren Bean, if Davis is correct that Abbott has defended the 2011 cuts in the school funding lawsuits. By email, Bean said yes, Abbotts office defended the law in court. In a follow-up email, she listed court rulings specifying the attorney general has an exclusive role in representing state agencies. Our ruling Davis said Abbott defended more than $5 billion in cuts in public school funding in fighting hundreds of school districts in court. Thats factually correct as far as it goes, but this claim is missing important details and context in that the state attorney general has a legal duty to represent the state in challenges reaching the Texas Supreme Court, which the latest school finance lawsuits are expected to do. It would be unusual for an attorney general not to defend a law and legislative actions in such a suit.

Final Rating: Half True  ",The public option is not funded with public money. It's funded with private insurance premiums.,"Amid debate over a health reform bill, the House adopted new restrictions on funding abortions, and Democratic congresswoman Diana DeGette is not happy about the development.As chairwoman of the Pro-Choice Caucus, DeGette of Colorado is upset that under the bill low-income individuals would not be able to use federal subsidies to buy abortion coverage through a health insurance exchange. Furthermore, a government-run health insurance option would not offer abortion coverage except in the case of rape, incest or when the life of the mother is endangered.Here's what she had to say about the issue on the Nov. 9, 2009, episode of theRachel Maddow Showon MSNBC.Nobody in the public option would be able to get an insurance policy that offered abortion coverage, she said. And we need to remember, the public option is not funded with public money. It's funded with private insurance premiums. So, let's say you have a small business owner who goes in to the public option because they can't get insurance anyplace else, and they want to buy a policy with their own private money, no federal money, that they would be banned from doing that.We'vealready exploredthe second part of DeGette's claim, that small businesses and individuals would not be able to buy abortion coverage through the exchange, and found it to be False. In fact, insurers can still offer abortion coverage through the exchange so long as the administrative structure behind it is not supported by federal money, and individuals can buy abortion coverage through the exchange so long as they use their own money.So, for this fact-check, we'll focus on DeGette's other point -- that the public option is funded by private insurance premiums, not public money.The public option has turned out to be the most controversial part of the health care reform. It's a government-run option for people buying insurance on the individual market, not through their employer, and it would be one of many plans offered through a new insurance exchange -- think of it as a one-stop shop for consumers where they can compare costs and benefits between plans. The hope is to increase competition and accountability within the insurance industry.So far, the Senate version of the bill does not include a public option, but Democratic Leader Harry Reid says the bill that comes to the Senate floor will likely include such a plan.The public option has become a flashpoint between Republican opponents of the bill and its Democratic advocates, in part because members of the GOP see it as a government effort to socialize medicine and too expensive. And now that the House has adopted an amendment that officially severed any ties between the public option and abortion coverage, tension between lawmakers on both sides of the abortion debate has only intensified.DeGette's point is that the public plan isn't really public at all because it will be sustained through premiums paid by consumers, so it should not exclude abortion coverage.We looked into exactly how the public option would be funded, and here's what we found: According to the House Energy and Commerce Committee, which has jurisdiction over the plan, the public option would be administered through the Department of Health and Human Services, and it would negotiate rates with providers in the public option. To make sure the public plan doesn't have an unfair advantage, the bill requires that the plan be self-sustaining; funding would come from the premiums consumers pay to get coverage.But the feds aren't exactly off the hook. The government will front the operation $2 billion to cover initial administrative costs and claims, though lawmakers expect that sum will be recouped after the program has been in operation for 10 years.So DeGette is right and she's wrong. In the long-term, the public option is meant to be self-sustaining. But first, it will require a big chunk of of public money to get started.

Its hard to believe that so many women are still paid less for men than the same work, with even wider gaps for women of color.

Their rankings show that the United States is 65th out of 142 nations and other territories on equal pay. Imagine that. We should be No. 1. That sounds pretty bad for a nation thats considered the worlds economic superpower. We wondered whether the United States is really that far back in the pack. We found a more complex picture than Clintons comments showed. One study that surveyed executives supported her point, but another study of wage data actually undermined it. Framing the wage gap question PolitiFact has written frequently in the past about how much of a pay differential exists for working men and women in the United States. While the exact phrasing has sometimes made a difference in our ratings, weve generally rated Mostly True the claims that women earn 77 or 78 cents for every dollar a man does, while weve generally rated Mostly False the claims that said women earned 77 or 78 cents for every dollar a man earned for the same work. Thats because the 77 to 78 cent figure refers to earnings by men and women irrespective of the specific job held. The 77 to 78 cent statistic reflects that men and women tend to choose different professions and work different numbers of hours per week -- factors that may be noteworthy for policymakers, but which do not directly reflect wage discrimination on the part of employers for women and men who hold the same job. When you compare men and women who hold the same or similar jobs, the pay gap shrinks significantly, though it does not disappear entirely. Global comparisons The new wrinkle in Clintons comments is the international comparison. The study she referred to was released by the World Economic Forum, a Switzerland-based group that describes itself as committed to improving the state of the world through public-private cooperation. It is best known for its annual meeting of world economic and political leaders in Davos, Switzerland. The groups Global Gender Gap Report 2014 says it quantifies the magnitude of gender-based disparities and tracks their progress over time. The group explained that the gender gap index looks at the relative gaps between women and men across four key areas: health, education, economy and politics. The primary yardstick in the report ranked the United States 20th out of 142 countries. By contrast, the 65th place ranking comes from one of the subcategories. Specifically, that 65th-place ranking came from a survey in which executives were asked to rate on a numerical scale their answer to the question, In your country, for similar work, to what extent are wages for women equal to those of men? So Clinton engaged in a bit of cherry-picking. By focusing on the United States 65th-place ranking, rather than its 20th-place ranking, Clinton painted a much grimmer picture. In addition, the particular data point she used is based on a survey of several hundred business executives in the United States. That means its based heavily on perceptions of how much gender-based wage bias exists, not just on hard data showing actual wage differentials. Those executives perceptions may or may not be based on accurate assumptions. That said, Clinton does have some justification for citing the ranking she did. On the question of cherry-picking, it does appear that the 65th-place data point is the one most directly focused on gender-based wage discrimination; the other data points refer to elements that are less directly related, such as labor-force participation rates and overall compensation. And on whether its appropriate to use a survey rather than wage statistics, doing so does at least has the advantage of recording answers from executives in a wide range of countries across the globe. There does not appear to be comprehensive wage data for all or most countries by gender. The Clinton campaign expressed confidence in the value of the World Economic Forum survey and emphasized that it involved a larger number of countries. Hard data on the unexplained gender gap However, the more limited hard data that does exist puts the United States in a more favorable light on wage equity than Clintons talking point would suggest. That data comes from the International Labor Organization, a division of the United Nations. The groups Global Wage Report 2014/15 compared data from 29 developed countries, plus Europe as a whole. This data looks not just at gender-based wage gaps, but at how much of that gap can be explained by demographic factors unrelated to employer discrimination, such as education, experience and the divergent career choices made by men and women. Once you remove the explained portion of the wage gap, whats left -- the unexplained portion of the gender gap -- is considered a more direct approximation of how much discrimination is occurring against women when compared to men who hold the same job. And on this score, the United States rates well. Of the 30 nations studied, only Germany has a smaller unexplained wage gap than the United States does. By this measure, the United States outpaces such advanced industrialized rivals as the United Kingdom, France, the Scandinavian countries and Europe as a whole. Thats a much less dire picture than the one Clinton painted in her speech. Our ruling Clinton said the United States is 65th out of 142 nations and other territories on equal pay. She has cited a finding from one international survey of executives, but other data -- including actual wage data from more than two dozen advanced countries -- shows the United States second only to Germany in the lack of gender-based wage discrimination for men and women who hold the same job.",0.5,0.5,1.0,0.5,0.0,0.5,0.5,1.0,0.5,half-true

Final Rating: Half True",Ive never supported legislation that invades peoples choices about contraception.,"Republican gubernatorial candidate Ken Cuccinelli is combating accusations that hes tried to restrict the types of birth control Virginians could use. Ive never supported legislation that invades peoples choices about contraception, Cuccinelli told reporters on Aug. 27 while campaigning in Northern Virginia. His comment was reported by The Washington Post and The Loudoun Times. Cuccinelli made a similar comment during a July 20 debate with Democrat Terry McAuliffe when he was asked by moderator Judy Woodruff, Would you again seek to make several forms of contraception illegal as you did several years ago? Well, I certainly didnt do that several years ago, Cuccinelli replied. We examined Cuccinellis claim. At issue is his support of support of two personhood bills that sought to provide human embryos with legal rights. Both bills died in the General Assembly. Supporters say personhood laws provide a legal remedy to parents if an unborn child is killed by the negligent or criminal act of a third party. Opponents say the measures are a ruse to challenge abortion and contraception rights. In 2007, Cuccinelli as a state senator co-sponsored legislation that would have given pre-born humans the right to the enjoyment of life from the moment fertilization. Critics, including McAuliffe, say the bill would have outlawed birth control pills and other forms of contraception that prevent a fertilized egg from implanting in a uterus. As attorney general, Cuccinelli last year spoke at a rally for a similar bill that would have extended to human embryos and fetuses, from the moment of conception, all the rights available to others living in Virginia. Anna Nix, a spokeswoman for Cuccinellis campaign, said her bosss statements are accurate because the legislation he backed simply defined life and had no language or reference to any form of contraception or any access to contraception. Nix added in a follow-up email that Cuccinelli does not believe the government should regulate contraception and supported this legislation because he is pro-life, and this bill would protect innocent life. The debate on personhoods effect on contraception centers on how various forms of birth control work. No one disputes that condoms and other forms of birth control that merely prevent fertilization would unaffected by a measure to provide legal rights to preborn children. But various forms of FDA-approved contraception can also work to prevent the implantation of fertilized egg in the uterus. For example, although birth control pills mainly work to prevent fertilization by preventing the release of an egg, they can also make the lining of the uterus inhospitable to implantation after its fertilized, according to WebMD. Emergency contraceptives if taken soon after intercourse can prevent the release of an egg to prevent fertilization. But if taken later, they can prevent the implantation of an egg. Some abortion opponents believe life begins at the moment of fertilization and consider anything that prevents a fertilized egg from attaching to the uterus as tantamount to producing an abortion. Thats sparked concerns from supporters of contraceptive access that conveying rights to human eggs from the moment of fertilization could open the door to limiting birth control products that can prevent affect implantation. Nix, in her statement, did not spell out exactly how Cuccinelli defines contraception. We asked if he includes in his definition any method that prevents implantation of a fertilized egg, but didnt get a clear response. The pharmaceutical structure for contraception is one that changes with ongoing medical research, Nix said. Ken Cuccinelli is not interested in legislating contraception. We should note that as a state senator back in 2003, Cuccinelli voted against a Democratic measure that would have specified contraception does not constitute abortion. The bill, which passed the Senate but died in the House, defined contraception as methods that block fertilization or prevent implantation of a fertilized egg in the uterus. The American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists weighed in on that debate last year warning that personhood laws being considered around the nation saying it threatened certain forms of contraception. Although the individual wording in these proposed measures varies from state to state, they all attempt to give full legal rights to a fertilized egg by defining `personhood from the moment of fertilization before conception (ie. pregnancy/implantation) has occurred, ACOG wrote.  That would make condoms, spermicides and natural family planning the only legally allowed forms of birth control, the group said. In other words, the doctors said that only birth control devices that prevent sperm from joining an egg would remain legal. Thus, some of the most effective and reliable forms of contraception, such as oral contraceptives, intrauterine devices (IUDs) and other forms of FDA-approved hormonal contraceptives could be banned in states that adopt personhood measures, ACOG said. Three days after ACOGs statement, the Virginias 2012 personhood bill was approved by the Republican-led House on an almost straight party line vote. Democrats unsuccessfully offered an amendment that specified the legislation shall not be interpreted as affecting lawful contraception. Two days later -- on Feb. 15, 2012 -- Cuccinelli endorsed the bill at rally on the Capitol grounds, although news stories contain no mention addressing contraception in his speech. The bill, however, died in the Senate. Both the 2012 and the 2007 measures may not have survived legal challenge even if they had passed. A.E. Dick Howard, a University of Virginia constitutional law professor, pointed out to us that the U.S. Supreme Court in 1972 ruled that couples have a right of access to contraception. Our ruling Cuccinelli, in a carefully-worded statement, says hes never supported legislation that invades peoples choices about contraception. While hes never cast a vote on legislation that explicitly restricted birth control options, Cuccinellifor a decade has been one of the strongest anti-abortion voices in Virginia. Hes supported personhood bills that recognized life as beginning at the moment of conception or fertilization and bestowed human embryos with legal rights. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists says such legislation could outlaw birth control pills and other forms of contraception that prevent a fertilized egg from implanting in a uterus. Cuccinellis wording also allows him to gloss over a vote he cast in 2003 against legislation that would have specified contraception does not constitute an abortion. So Cuccinellis claim has some accuracy, but omits his consistent support of bills that would have opened or protected legal avenues to challenge the use of certain contraceptives.",0.5,0.6,1.0,0.4,0.0,0.5,0.5,1.0,0.5,half-true

Final Rating: Half True  ","The Legislature passed Gov. Walkers so-called property tax relief bill, but the Republicans are still raising your property taxes.","Soon it will be December and time for presents -- including your annual property tax bill. Oh, the suspense in opening the envelope: Will this years bill be lower or higher? But wait. On Oct. 24, 2013, Republican Gov. Scott Walker used his weekly radio address to herald a $100 million property tax relief bill he signed into law four days earlier. Relief means lower taxes, right? After we heard the opening lines of the Democratic response, put out the same day, we werent sure what to think. Last week, the Legislature passed Gov. Walkers so-called property tax relief bill, Ashland state Rep. Janet Bewley said in her address. Lost in all the hype is the fact that the governor and Republican-controlled Legislature are still raising your property taxes. So, is the property tax relief real? Is it somehow superseded by property tax increases? And dont school districts and other local governments help determine how big your property tax bill is? Property tax primer Well start by reviewing how a property tax bill comes to be. Every fall, each local unit of government -- cities, villages, towns, counties, school districts, and technical college districts -- adopts a budget for the following year. They subtract what they expect to receive in revenue, such as state aid, license fees, tuition, etc. The remainder has to come from property taxes, which happens to be the largest source of tax revenue in Wisconsin. In total, local governments levy more than 99% of all property taxes; the state claims the last sliver, for forestry programs. Nevertheless, state government plays an important role in how much your property tax bill turns out to be. First of all, the local governments levies get reduced by three state tax credits, including the state lottery credit. Second, the state has imposed a variety of caps on how much money local governments can raise or spend. So, even though the locals are the ones levying property taxes, the state puts strict limits on how much they can levy. For example, school districts are limited in the amount of money they can raise in total from property taxes and state aid. On the other hand, school districts can exceed their limits if voters approve a referendum. For municipalities and counties, their levy growth, if any, is limited to the amount of property taxes generated by new construction in their communities. The new law Reining in property taxes has been one of Walkers priorities as governor. On Oct. 10, 2013, citing growth in state tax revenue, he called a special session of the Legislature to take up property tax relief -- specifically by increasing state aid to school districts. So, the approach was not a simple across-the-board tax reduction. The property tax relief measure was approved overwhelmingly on bipartisan votes -- 82-12 in the Assembly, with Bewley among the Democrats voting for it, and 28-5 in the Senate. The law raises state aid payments to school districts by $40 million (0.92%) in 2013-14 and $60 million (1.36%) in 2014-15. But, as we discussed earlier, school districts are under revenue limits. So, while individual levies for school districts will vary, statewide the additional $100 million in state aid to school districts triggers a corresponding $100 million decrease in property taxes. State schools Superintendent Tony Evers pointed out that while the new law provides property tax relief for some school districts, it does not increase spending for public schools. Now, to Bewleys claim that Walker and the GOP-run Legislature are still raising your property taxes. The state budget In her radio remarks, Bewley argued that despite the property tax relief, the average persons property taxes will rise. When we asked for evidence, her office cited an October 2013 memo from the nonpartisan Legislative Fiscal Bureau. It takes into account not only the property tax relief, but also the 2013-15 state budget that Walker signed into law several months earlier. In contrast to the property tax relief bill, the state budget was adopted without a single Democratic vote. It passed 55-42 in the Assembly, with three Republicans voting no; then it passed 17-16 in the Senate, with one Republican voting no. According to the fiscal bureau, the property tax for a median-valued home -- $151,148 -- was $2,943. Under the biennial state budget, the tax was to drop by $5 in the first year, then increase by $36 in the second. That put the tax bill on the typical home at $2,974 -- a net increase of $31 over the two years. But with the property tax relief law, the tax on the typical home is now estimated to go down by $18 in the first year and increase $29 in the second. That would put the tax bill at $2,954 -- a net increase of $11. Walker spokesman Tom Evenson agreed with the figures, but noted that property tax increases have been held down under during Walker's first two years in office. He cited an August 2013 Wisconsin Taxpayers Alliance report that said total property taxes, not just the portion levied by school districts, rose by 0.2% in 2011-12 and 0.8% in 2012-13. That was the first time since at least 1946 that the total levy rose by less than 1% in two consecutive years, the report said. Our rating Bewley said the Legislature passed Gov. Walkers so-called property tax relief bill, but the Republicans are still raising your property taxes. Bewleys right that under the Republicans 2013-15 state budget, its estimated that property tax bills will rise, by an estimated $11 over two years for a typical home. But the increase would have been larger without the property tax relief, and property tax bills are affected by actions taken by local governments, not just the GOP-controlled state government. For a statement that is partially accurate but leaves out important details, we give Bewley a Half True.

Final Rating: Half True  ",Says shedebated her opponent multiple times.,"Charles Francis wants to stand on stage with Raleigh Mayor Nancy McFarlane and debate the best ways to address the citys issues. Francis on Sunday called for a runoff against McFarlane after the mayor, in municipal elections on Oct. 10, fell about 2 percentage points short of reaching the 50 percent required to secure the win. Francis, who trailed with 36 percent of the vote, says the two candidates have yet to debate. McFarlane, reacting to Francis announcement, on Monday challenged the idea that they havent debated. We debated multiple times, McFarlane said. Im not sure why he keeps bringing up this narrative that weve never debated. We had multiple forums. There were maybe five. How can one candidate say hes still waiting to debate while another says theyve debated multiple times? Because they appear to have different definitions of the word debate. Francis, an attorney, says McFarlane has declined his offer to stand on stage with him in a televised event where they argue the issues one-on-one. Debates are important so that voters can better see the clear alternative that they have in this race, he said in a statement. Mayor McFarlane has now tentatively agreed to a televised debate during the runoff election. I believe that this debate will point out the clear differences for voters to make an informed decision. McFarlane, a longtime pharmaceutical business owner, considers it a debate if the two candidates are in the same location at the same time explaining their political positions to voters. Her campaign notes that Francis has twice referred to events they attended as debates: in closing comments during the Aug. 15 Raleigh Wake Citizens Association forum; and on his Facebook page when he referred to a Sept. 28 forum as a debate. That may be true. But that doesnt necessarily mean either candidates definition of debate is accurate. Defining debate Merriam-Webster defines debate as a regulated discussion of a proposition between two matched sides and Dictionary.com says its a discussion, as of a public question in an assembly, involving opposing viewpoints. By those definitions, McFarlane certainly has a case. Both candidates have been in the same location at the same time answering the same questions. The Commission on Presidential Debates is a nonprofit group that has organized debates for presidential and vice presidential candidates in every general election since 1988. The commission doesnt offer a definition for a debate or list requirements to hold one. Instead, it offers a wide range of formats that can be used in debates and suggests that political debates should be structured and allow for rebuttals. The aforementioned descriptions are so vague that they dont necessarily help us in this situation. So we asked experts on political science, communication and forensics (which means debate) what they consider to be a true political debate. Key components They all suggested political debates include three elements: a stage, a large audience, and a format that allows for two candidates – and preferably no more – to engage each other in a way that allows for claims and rebuttals. The experts cast doubt on McFarlanes claim that forums qualify as debates. Forums where candidates answer the same questions could qualify as debates if the candidates are given time to engage each other, said David McLennan, professor of political science at Meredith College in Raleigh. But typically, they dont. Unless theyre addressing one another in the same venue, it wouldnt be a political debate, McLennan said. Allan Louden, chair of the communications department at Wake Forest University, researches argumentation theory, political communication and presidential rhetoric. Louden referred to forums not as debates but as joint appearances. He says debates are supposed to inform the public about key policy differences between candidates and that, by allowing candidates to challenge each other, face-to-face arguments are the best way to do that. He noted that the size of the audience matters. Debates are not much good if you dont have an audience. Robert Imbody, director of forensics at the University of Alabama, said he doesnt think any of the events qualify as a traditional political debate. He echoed McLennan and Louden in saying theres got to be crossfire. When we talk about what is a debate, were talking about an organized clash, Imbody said. If theres no clash or discord, then theres nothing to debate. Youre just giving speeches. So lets look at the events McFarlane and Francis attended together. McFarlanes campaign says she and Francis attended seven events together between Aug. 15 and Sept. 28. Three stood out to PolitiFact. Raleigh events On Aug. 15, McFarlane and Francis both attended the Raleigh Wake Citizens Association forum at Martin Street Baptist Church. James Sonneman, a spokesman for McFarlanes campaign, said the mayoral candidates were interviewed separately from council candidates. During the mayoral portion, only Francis and Nancy participated and were given ample room to engage in a discussion regarding questions posed by community members, Sonneman said. The event was not televised or streamed online. A recording provided by Sonneman includes audio of McFarlane and Francis answering the same questions, one at a time, and occasionally asking the moderator for a chance to respond to the other candidate. In closing comments, Francis said, I want to thank you all for your attention in the debate tonight. On Sept. 18, Sonneman says they attended a similar event: the Wake County Voter Education Coalition Forum at Garner Rd. Community Center. As I understand, it had a very similar agenda to the RWCA forum in that Mayoral and Council candidates went separately and that an engaging discussion between Nancy and Francis was fostered, he said. On Sept. 28, Francis and McFarlane attended a forum hosted by the League of Women Voters and WakeUP Wake County Forum at Avent Ferry United Methodist Church. The event, where mayoral and City Council candidates were asked the same questions, was streamed online at wral.com. The video shows McFarlane and Francis often taking turns answering the same question. In Mondays press conference, McFarlane pointed to the WakeUP event as a debate. Karen Rindge, executive director of WakeUP, said the format allowed for the candidates to engage each other. They could have raised a point about their opponent if they chose, Rindge said. However, I would not describe our candidate forum as a structured debate. Our ruling McFarlane said she has debated Francis multiple times. The candidates were indeed in the same place and exchanged ideas back-to-back. And Francis referred to a couple forums as debates. But political experts say most of the events shes referring to didnt include the key elements often needed for a fair, informative political debate.  ",0.5,0.5,1.0,0.5,0.0,0.5,0.5,1.0,0.5,half-true

Final Rating: Half True  ",The Trump administration has denied 4.2 million American workers overtime.,"As President Donald Trump praises his economic record while campaigning for re-election, Florida Democrats say that he hasnt done enough to help the middle class. The Trump administration has given corporations a $1 trillion tax cut — with almost nothing going into the pockets of workers — while at the same time, gutting workers rights, consumer protections, and denying 4.2 million American workers overtime, the Florida Democratic Party said in a press release, a day before Trumps Orlando rally. Its an exaggeration to say almost nothing is going into the pockets of workers, as our previous reporting shows. We wondered if the Trump administration denied 4.2 million American workers overtime. It turns out thats something of an exaggeration, too. Most employees are eligible for time-and-a-half overtime pay if they work more than 40 hours a week. But theres an exception for white-collar workers. To be considered a white-collar worker by the government, an employee has to make more than $455 per week, be paid a salary, and work in an administrative, executive or professional position. People who meet these criteria do not qualify for overtime pay. The Obama administration sought to boost the amount of money a white collar worker could earn and qualify for overtime. So in 2016, the Obama administration announced it would extend overtime eligibility to white collar salaried workers earning less than $913 a week, or $47,476 a year, about double the exemption level set in 2004 of $455 per week or $23,660 a year. The change would have extended eligibility to 4.2 million additional Americans, the Obama administration said. But a federal court in Texas halted the rule amid a challenge by Republican-led states and business trade groups. The Trump administration did not defend the Obama-era rule change, dropping the governments appeal in 2017. Instead, the Trump administration proposed its own rule; its number was more than the earlier exemption level but lower than the Obama rule. In March, the Labor Department proposed making workers eligible for overtime if they earn $679 per week, or $35,308 per year. Above this salary level, eligibility for overtime varies based on job duties. (The rule does not change overtime protections for various blue collar workers including police officers, firefighters, nurses and non-management employees in construction.) While the Obama rule would have automatically adjusted the salary threshold every three years, the Trump rule doesnt include that. The new Trump rule is expected to be finalized in 2020. The Democrats statement omits that the Trump administration wants to extend overtime to some Americans, though a much smaller number than Obamas rule intended to help 4.2 million in the first year. The Trump Labor Department estimates that its rule would provide overtime to around 1.3 million extra workers. Heidi Shierholz, who was the chief economist at Obamas Labor Department when the overtime rule was proposed and now works for the Economic Policy Institute, estimated that the Obama rule would have given new protections to 4.6 million workers in 2020 due to automatic updating. Daniel S. Hamermesh, a Barnard College economist, put the figure somewhat lower. He estimated that it would have led to about 3 million more people getting overtime. So the best conclusion is that the Trump regulation would leave unprotected about 2 million workers who would have been protected under the Obama regulation, he told PolitiFact. However, these are estimates, and its not possible to precisely know how many would have gotten overtime as a result of the Obama rule or the proposed Trump rule. Some factors are unknown, such as how employers would attempt to skirt the rules. We do know one thing, Hamermesh said. We know for sure the Trump partial rollback of the regulation will undoubtedly result in fewer people getting overtime pay than would have been the case under the Obama regulation, and the total amount of overtime paid to all people will also be less compared with the Obama rule. Rachel Greszler, a research fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation, said that there isnt a guarantee that all of those additional people would end up getting a higher paycheck under the Obama or Trump plan. Corporations could respond to changes in overtime thresholds by reducing base wages and other compensation, leaving workers total compensation the same. The Florida Democratic Party said the Trump administration has denied 4.2 million American workers overtime. In 2016, the Obama administration set a rule that would have raised the salary threshold for overtime pay, which it said would extend overtime to 4.2 million more workers. The Democrats omit that the Trump administration has proposed raising the salary threshold to extend overtime to about 1.3 million workers. Thats less than Obamas proposal, but not a denial to all 4.2 million workers.",0.5,0.5,1.0,0.5,0.0,0.5,0.5,1.0,0.5,half-true

Final Rating: Half True  ","Thanks to the Trans-Pacific Partnership, Vietnam is drafting and presenting unprecedented labor reforms, changing their Constitution to recognize worker organizations in Vietnam for the first time.","At a press conference with Singapores Prime Minister Lee Loong, President Barack Obama said the Trans-Pacific Partnership would improve global labor rights. Specifically, he said Vietnam had agreed to improve its labor policies as a condition of entering into the 12-country trade agreement, which has been contentious this election cycle. Vietnam is drafting and presenting unprecedented labor reforms, changing their Constitution to recognize worker organizations in Vietnam for the first time, Obama said. We fact-checked another TPP claim from the press conference, on tariffs, elsewhere. Here, we look at Obamas Vietnam claim. Labor law Before diving into what the TPP asks of Vietnam, lets look at what protections Vietnam already affords workers. The 2013 Vietnamese Constitution provides for break policies, equal and safe work conditions and protects against discrimination, forced labor and under-age workers. It also establishes trade unions to represent workers and protect their legal rights. According to a 2012 Law on Trade Unions, however, this is an entity placed under the leadership of the Communist Party of Vietnam. Essentially, all trade unions must affiliate with the Vietnam General Confederation of Labour. We consulted various law firms that cover Vietnamese labor law, and they detailed Vietnams already-existing labor protections. According to the the Southeast Asian law firm Tilleke & Gibbins, Vietnam sets a maximum of 48 hours per week and provides mandatory rest periods of at minimum 24 consecutive hours per week. Employers are required to provide protective equipment, and there is maternity leave typically around four months. The labor law firm Fisher Phillips classified Vietnams labor law as employee-friendly. We spoke to White House representatives who acknowledged Vietnam had such provisions. So, what then, was Obama referring to as unprecedented labor reforms? Work-in-progress The White House pointed us to a consistency plan negotiated as part of the TPP, titled the United States — Vietnam Plan for the Enhancement of Trade and Labour Relations. Key to the plan is the decoupling of labor unions from the government. Workers must be allowed to spontaneously form a grassroots labour union.The union must be registered, but not affiliated with, the government, thus allowing it to operate by its own rules and procedures. Vietnam shall ensure that its law does not mandate a labour union registered with the competent government body to operate according to the Statutes of Vietnam General Confederation of Labour, the plan states. Experts we spoke to said the term unprecedented is valid. The workers can form their own unions, said K. William Watson, a trade policy analyst at the libertarian Cato Institute. That's going to be a big change for Vietnam just because of the way it currently regulates labor unions. Its not going to be compatible with the TPP at all. John Sifton, Asia Advocacy director at Human Rights Watch, said independent unions are the first step to having workers enforce their own rights. This other stuff about minimum wage and working ours, all of that, is meaningless if you dont have unions, he said. Without unions, without the capacity to organize, whatever workers rights are written down on paper dont have teeth. Changes to labor laws are still going through the countrys legislative process, they said. While acknowledging that might be the case, Sifton said Obamas claim was premature for suggesting current changes. Theyve signed up to a whole lot of things and if President Obama had simply said, Vietnam has promised and must do a whole bunch of things under the TPP, then he would have been perfectly accurate, Sifton noted. But he made it sound like Vietnam has already started to do things and thats just not true. Enforcement Changing the law is one thing, but actually implementing it is another. Prior to the TPP entering into force, Vietnam must change its labor code to correspond with the side agreement, the White House explained. The plan also provides a review mechanism after-the-fact whereby the United States can impose higher tariffs on Vietnam if the provisions are not being implemented. Nonetheless, experts questioned both the likelihood of Vietnam implementing the new rules and of the United States enforcing them. Both Sifton and Watson noted Americas poor track record in enforcing other free trade agreements labor provisions. They have a terrible record of enforcing labor chapters as evidenced by the Central American Free Trade Agreement and the North American Free Trade Agreement and the Colombian Free Trade Agreement, Sifton said. So he says theyre enforceable and thats true on paper and its true technically, but it doesnt mean it would be be enforced. Watson, on the other hand, said it is in Vietnams economic interest — due to their significant gains from the TPP — to abide by the proposed legal changes. In order to attract investors, they have to follow the rules and wont be too antagonistic to the agreement, he explained. Its not a situation where this was something that they didnt want and now theyre going to try to sidestep it, he said. Vietnam is — economically — the country that will benefit the most from the TPP. Vague language in the consistency plan could also hinder implementation, said Angie Ngoc Tran, a professor at California State University. In an article in New Mandala, she criticized the deal for not offering enough protection for independent unions and other procedural issues. On the flip side,Cathleen Cimino-Isaacs at thePeterson Institute for International Economics, said the TPP has made progress to address past failures. ThePeterson Institute for International Economics has been described as a pro-trade economic policy group. Although the TPP does not address all the concerns of labor rights advocates, it represents an important step forward, Cimino-Isaacs wrote. The bilateral plans negotiated alongside the TPP are a major innovative component, targeted to address the substandard labor conditions of most concern. Implementation of the mandated reforms would deliver signiﬁcant improvements in Brunei, Malaysia, and Vietnam. The monitoring mechanisms attached to Vietnams plan in particular seem more proactive than past U.S. efforts. Our ruling Obama said Vietnam is drafting and presenting unprecedented labor reforms and is changing their constitution to recognize worker organizations in Vietnam for the first time. There are some problems with the claim. Experts said actual changes to the law have not happened yet but acknowledged the drafting process might be underway. They did agree, however, that the changes proposed would qualify as unprecedented. More critically, they said its hard to enforce the changes being described and the United States has a particularly poor track record of doing so. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/0b4621f6-693f-412e-9d5f-d66f11d089be (Update Aug. 5: This fact-check was updated to includeCimino-Isaacs' comments.)",0.5,0.5,1.0,0.5,0.0,0.0,0.5,0.5,0.5,half-true

Final Rating: Half True  ","I think if you look at the entire federal government and the presidents commitment to (fighting opioid addiction), youll see that there are actually hundreds of millions of dollars increase on this issue.","President Donald Trump has made a lot of promises to solve the countrys opioid crisis, which killed over 33,000 people in 2015 alone. They included the pledge to build a wall on the southern border to stop the flow of drugs from Mexico and Latin America and more money to accelerate new treatment and prevention programs. Secretary for the Department of Health and Human Services Tom Price and Counselor to the president Kellyanne Conway reiterated Trumps commitment to end the opioid crisis this month, as they visited New Hampshire - a state that has been one of the hardest hit by drug deaths. Their visit came a week after it was announced that the Trump administration had been planning to gut the Office of National Drug Control Policy, slashing the long-running agency's budget by $364 million, or about 95 percent, in its proposed budget. As it turned out, they did not go through with such a steep cut in Trumps final budget. Asked about the proposed cuts, Price said, I think if you look at the entire federal government and the presidents commitment to this challenge, youll see that there are actually hundreds of millions of dollars increase on this issue. But do Trumps proposals mesh with Prices statements about increasing money for treatment, prevention and recovery? Crunching the numbers To get some clarity, we reached out to the Department of Health and Human Services to get a numbers breakdown. A spokesman for HHS responded, pointing to funding in the Congressional omnibus bill, the temporary spending measure to keep the government running that was passed in early May. At minimum, the Omnibus provides $213 million in new funding to combat the opioid epidemic across the federal government, Alleigh Marre said. With all that in mind, the Secretarys comment that there is a hundreds of millions of dollars increase across the federal government, is true. However, that number includes money that was passed by Congress in 2016, before Trump was president, and doesnt account for the presidents proposed federal budget. Heres the breakdown of whats in that number: $500 million in 21st Century Cures Act grant money, which was passed by Congress under President Obama. $150 million as part of the 2017 omnibus, which includes money for the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, Centers for Disease Control and Health Resources and Services Administration to fight addiction. Marre also highlighted $12.5 million in funding for four new heroin enforcement groups within the DEA and $50 million to the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs to fund opioid and substance abuse prevention and treatment programs.  But since Price cited Trumps commitment to combat the opioid crisis, its important to note what money was approved before he took office. Budget and health care bill Beyond these budget increases, however, experts on addiction and recovery say that other proposals by Trump wont help ease the opioid crisis and could actually make it worse. His budget is asking for almost $400 million in cuts to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, which could result in fewer mental health block grants being distributed. And the recently proposed Republican health care bill, which Trump supports, proposes drastic cuts to Medicaid. The House bill calls for $800 billion of cuts to Medicaid in 10 years, on top of the $610 billion cut to Medicaid benefits sought in Trumps budget. That means Medicaid spending could be cut by 45 percent in 10 years. This has serious implications for people who get health insurance through expanded Medicaid in New Hampshire and elsewhere, many of whom get mental health treatment and substance abuse coverage paid. And that has many treatment advocates in New Hampshire worried. We need a system of response that includes access to treatment, recovery, and also, we have to address the supply side through supporting law enforcement in their work. Im not seeing evidence that thats actually happening, said Linda Saunders Paquette, director of treatment advocacy organization New Futures. Its worth noting that the presidents budget is just a blueprint; members of Congress have said they are unlikely to approve the spending plan as written. Our Ruling Citing Trumps commitment to fight the countrys opioid crisis, Price said the government is already spending hundreds of millions of dollars more to that end. More funding was approved in the recent Congressional omnibus bill to keep the government running, but other policies hes seeking to pursue -- notably cuts to Medicaid -- could wipe out that increase and then some.",0.5,0.5,1.0,0.5,0.0,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,half-true

Final Rating: Half True  ",In every other major industrial country in the world  inflation is higher.,"When President Joe Biden sat down for an interview with The Associated Press, it was inevitable that the nations 40-year-high levels of inflation would come up. During the interview, Biden said his policies are not to blame. Instead, he pointed to global conditions to show that the United States is not alone in facing such challenges as high oil prices, lagging supply chains during the pandemic, and disruptions from Russian President Vladimir Putins war in Ukraine. Biden said, First of all, (a recession is) not inevitable. Secondly, were in a stronger position than any nation in the world to overcome this inflation. Its bad. Isnt it kind of interesting? If its my fault, why is it the case in every other major industrial country in the world that inflation is higher? You ask yourself that? Im not being a wise guy. A reader noticed this statement and asked us to fact-check it. The statement can be read two ways. Is Biden (as the reader understood it) saying that every other major industrial country has a higher inflation rate than the U.S. does right now? Or is Biden saying that every other major industrial country has higher inflation than they normally do? The White House did not respond to an inquiry for this article. But well look at both interpretations. The accuracy of his statement depends on how his words are interpreted. If this is what Biden meant, he would be wrong. We turned to data collected by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, a group of advanced industrialized nations. Looking at the most recent monthly inflation numbers, more than a dozen OECD members had a higher inflation rate than the United States 8.6%. These were predominantly Baltic and Eastern European nations, which have been hit especially hard by the consequences of Putins invasion of Ukraine. But a larger number of OECD members had inflation rates lower than 8.6%, and these include all but one member of the G-7 group, which is limited to the worlds very largest democratic economies. Among the G-7 nations, Germanys most recent inflation rate was 7.9%, the United Kingdoms was 7.8%, Italys and Canadas were 6.8%, and Frances was 5.2%. (The final G-7 member, Japan, hasnt released current inflation numbers.) So the United States has a higher inflation rate currently than its closest economic peers do.  If this is what Biden meant, he would be right. In the six G-7 nations for which current inflation data is available — including the United States — pre-pandemic inflation rates hovered around 1% or 2%, rather than the 5% to 9% being seen now.  Some analysts would suggest that these two observations are consistent. They say that Bidens coronavirus relief bill — the American Rescue Plan, which passed shortly after he took office in 2021 — drove inflation higher in the United States than it did in the other countries, which had no equivalent fiscal stimulus of that scale that late in the pandemic. The Biden administration and its allies in Congress provided entirely too much stimulus into an economy that was already dealing with supply shortages, said Michael Faulkender, a finance professor at the University of Marylands Robert H. Smith School of Business. This is necessarily inflationary and was totally predictable. However, the U.S. may have benefited in other ways from its expansionary monetary and fiscal policy during the pandemic compared to other rich countries,Brookings Institution economist Gary Burtless said. The U.S. may have obtained some advantage from those expansionary policies in terms of faster real economic growth than its rivals, Burtless said. The downside, he added, is that these policies also seem to have produced the disadvantage of higher inflation. Biden said, In every other major industrial country in the world  inflation is higher. Hes right in one sense but wrong in another. Every other major industrialized nation has seen inflation spike well above pre-inflation levels. But the United States has seen its inflation rate spike higher than its most direct competitors.",0.5,0.5,1.0,0.5,0.0,0.5,0.5,1.0,0.5,half-true

Final Rating: Half True  ","Thanks to our policies, for the first time in state history, we have put millions of dollars into our rainy day fund in consecutive years.","With a better-than-expected tax-collection estimate and savings from delaying some debt payments, Gov. Scott Walker on May 10, 2012 made a small deficit at the mid-point in his two-year budget -- poof -- disappear.Gone along with it: An issue Democrats were using against Walker in the June 5, 2012 recall election.This was posted the following day on the Walker campaign blog:Not only have we turned away from the failed policies that drove us to the brink of insolvency with chronic billion-dollar budget deficits, double-digit tax increases and record-setting job loss, but we have taken a complete 180 degree turn to true prosperity with a budget surplus that will help far into our future, the post read in part.The Walkers campaign boasted the news was so good extra funds will be socked away in budget-stabilization account: For the first time in state history, we have put millions of dollars into our rainy day fund in consecutive years.History, or course, can be an awful long time.Did back-to-back contributions happen thanks to Walkers policies?Wisconsin first created a stabilization fund in 1985, so its actually a fairly new thing. But the state has seldom put money into it. Thats one reason Wisconsin lives closer to the fiscal edge than many other states.According to the Legislative Fiscal Bureau, the first deposit into the fund was in 2006-07, during the final term of Democratic Gov. Jim Doyle, Walkers predecessor.That deposit totalled $55.6 million, but was quickly used up in a budget crisis later in Doyles term.The second deposit made to the fund -- $14.8 million -- came at the end of Doyles last budget, 2010-11. The deposit was made after Walker had taken office. His first six months overlapped the final six months of the Doyle budget.That brings us to May 2012.Thats when Walker signalled that he could make another deposit, estimated at $45.4 million, after the fiscal year ends June 30, 2012.So, did Walker -- for the first time in state history put millions of dollars into our rainy day fund in consecutive years?Not exactly.First, the deposit is a projection. It would make two budgets in a row for the first time if it happens. It looks likely that a deposit will be made, but its premature to say it already happened.Second, the numbers are not based on the official revenue estimates that come from the Fiscal Bureau, the neutral scorekeeper on budget items. That caused Democrats to howl in protest when Walker put out the well-timed news.In February 2012, the Fiscal Bureau said that tax revenues were coming up short, leaving a small projected deficit by June 2013.The new Walker estimate is based on revenue forecasts compiled by Walkers Department of Administration for February, March and April. In a May memo to Walker, Administration Secretary Mike Huebsch described it as the potential for a $45.4 million deposit when the books close at the end of June 2012.While not official, the estimates are based on the same sources of data used by the Fiscal Bureau. Bureau Director Bob Lang told us he didnt verify Walkers numbers but said they dont appear unreasonable.Well know the size of the actual deposit, if there is one, when the state completes its annual financial report once accounts are settled, in late summer. Its also possible the deposit could exceed the projected $45.4 million.Who deserves credit?While 2011 was Doyles final budget year, it was Walker who brought the budget back into balance with his budget-repair bill in early 2011.You may recall that little old bill -- the one that included higher pension and health-insurance payments from state and local government employees, and curtailed collective bargaining for most public employees.Likewise, the expected 2012 surplus would clearly be on Walkers watch.But its arguable how much a governor has to do with rising tax collections. Walkers administration attributed the brighter tax-collection forecasts in large part to improved job-creation figures and personal income growth, which are subject to economic cycles. Additionally, putting money in the stabilization fund is not a matter of choice. By law, 50 percent of any surplus from higher-than-expected income and other tax collections must be transferred to the rainy day fund. Thats exactly what Walker is saying he would deposit.I believe that both the Doyle deposit and pending Walker deposit were not done by volition or predetermined plan but by a state law requirement when excess funds appear, said Todd Berry, president of the Wisconsin Taxpayers Alliance.But we attribute budget deficits to elected officials, so they must also get some credit for surpluses.Our ratingWalkers took credit for what the campaign said was a historic double-up of surplus tax funds into a rainy day fund for stabilizing future state budgets. The chances for a second straight transfer into the fund appear good, but its premature to say the money is in the bank.Walker gets the bulk of the credit, but his campaign claim is just partially accurate, because it skips over the important fact that the deals not done yet.

Final Rating: Half True  ","Three of the 11 most violent cities in the U.S. are in Missouri — St. Louis, Kansas City, and Springfield.","The FBI releases its Uniform Crime Report every year. And every year politicians, news outlets and pundits use it to rank cities by their rate of violence, despite FBI cautions against doing so. This year was no different. In his first State of the State address, Missouri Republican Gov. Eric Greitens used the data to make a point: The state has a crime problem. Three of the 11 most violent cities in the U.S. are in Missouri — St. Louis, Kansas City and Springfield, Greitens said. And its not just in the cities. When you talk to sheriffs, chiefs of police and front line officers around the state, theyll tell you its getting harder to do police work. We wondered if the statistic was true. Were Missouris three largest cities also some of the most violent in the country? The limits of comparing cities Taken at face value, the crime reporting data paints a bleak picture of crime in the state. If you were to compare the rate of violent crime for U.S. cities with a population of at least 100,000, Greitens would appear to be on target. In 2015, the most recent year with available data, St. Louis was in first place with a crime rate of 1,817 per 100,000. Kansas City came in 10th place (1,417 per 100,000) and Springfield in 11th (1,355 per 100,000). However, according to Richard Rosenfeld, a criminology professor at University of Missouri-St. Louis, rankings should be taken with a grain of salt. Crime statistics are simply not accurate enough to, for example, meaningfully distinguish city number five from city number six or seven in a ranking of city crime rates, Rosenfeld said. But they can be used to compare the crime rates in cities of similar size and demographics. Lets take, for instance, the 50 largest cities in the country. Detroit, with a population of 673,225, had the highest rate of violent crime, at 1,759 per 100,000. Kansas City fell in 6th place. But St. Louis isnt even included on that list. The city, which does not include the smaller, suburban cities around the downtown area, is the 57th largest city with a population of 317,095. And Springfield, with a population of 166,860, isnt anywhere near as large as Kansas City (473,373). Why does this matter? One reason is that any increase in crime has a larger effect on smaller populations than it does on more populous areas. An increase of 200 more violent crimes in Springfield would bump the city up three places on the list. The same hypothetical increase for Kansas City bumps it up one place. Over the last few years, Kansas City and St. Louis have remained around the same spot on the rankings, give or take two or three ranks. Springfield, however, was in the 27th spot in 2012. To Greitens credit, if you were to compare these cities to other cities with about the same population, the three have higher than average crime. St. Louis crime rate was 2.5 times the average rate of violent crime for cities with a population of 250,00 or more. Kansas Citys was a little under twice the average rate. Springfield has surprisingly high crime rates, Rosenfeld said. Compared to the average rate of violent crime for cities with between 100,000 and 250,000 people, Springfield had almost three times as much violent crime. Rosenfeld said much of that has to do with poverty. When you see high levels of poverty, you tend to see high levels of crime, he said. Almost 55 percent of kids in the Springfield R-12 school district qualify for free or reduced-price lunches, a measure of poverty, according to data from the Missouri Department of Education. Because factors like crime and other underlying characteristics vary from city to city, even the FBI says its unfair to rank them on a single variable like crime. Data users should not rank locales because there are many factors that cause the nature and type of crime to vary from place to place, reads an FBI disclaimer. UCR statistics include only jurisdictional population figures along with reported crime, clearance, or arrest data. Rankings ignore the uniqueness of each locale. The disclaimer lists several dozen different factors, including economic conditions, citizens crime reporting practices and population density. Cities are considerably different from another based on things like demographics, tourism, commutes, said James Alan Fox, a criminology professor at Northeastern University. Where does the city end? Because crime doesnt respect political boundaries, presenting data from a crime-infested area as an exact reflection of an entire city can be misleading. The FBI estimated the St. Louis metro-area population at 2.8 million in 2015, and Kansas Citys was a little more than 2 million. Yet the populations considered in the crime reporting data were 317,000 for St. Louis and 473,000 for Kansas City. One of the problems is the extent to which nonresidents spend time in the citys center, Fox said. Suburbs have a moderating effect on the data, so crime rate can depend on how many suburbs are included in the citys jurisdiction. For St. Louis, that appears to be the case. Sam Dotson, the police chief of the St. Louis Metro Police Department, said the Uniform Crime Reporting statistics are absolutely not reflective of crime in the region. Unlike almost every major metropolitan area in the country, St. Louis city is independent from its county. In 1877, the two split after a contentious and narrow vote among county residents and city voters, many of whom were tired of the extra tax burden from the county. When St. Louis city made a decision to separate itself, it was political, Dotson said. Were living with the repercussions today. The county crime data has an equalizing effect. If you were to combine the county with the city, St. Louis crime rate would fall to around 44 on the list, Dotson said. He did not deny that the city has a crime problem, which he said has everything to do with the citys level of poverty. We have crime, Dotson said. We have too much crime. So does everywhere else. To single us out is wrong. Dotson also disagreed with Greitens comments blaming crime on the ability of police departments to perform their job. Policing has a piece and responsibility, he said. But police officers cant fix school systems. Police officers cant fix the economy. If you want to reduce crime in Kansas City, St. Louis and Springfield, you have to address those issues too. Our ruling Greitens said, Three of the 11 most violent cities in the U.S. are in Missouri — St. Louis, Kansas City and Springfield. Greitens is basing his comments on high-quality data, but he uses the data in ways that experts recommend against. Experts dispute the reliability of ranking one city against others based on crime rates. Even the FBI, which compiles the statistics, has a policy against the practice. Greitens statement is partially accurate but takes things out of context.",0.5,0.5,1.0,0.5,0.0,0.5,0.5,1.0,0.5,half-true

Final Rating: Half True  ",Says 282 Texas school districts have requested emergency waivers to increase elementary school class sizes because of unprecedented fiscal challenges.,"In a Jan. 9, 2012, press release, U.S. Rep. Silvestre Reyes, D-El Paso, urged Republican Gov. Rick Perry to convene a special legislative session so lawmakers can provide more money to under-served schools. Citing the Legislature's 2011 decision to give school districts $4 billion less through August 2013 than they would have gotten under previous funding formulas, Reyes said: Our school districts are now experiencing unprecedented fiscal challenges and being forced to take drastic measures, like increasing class sizes and cutting instructional supports. In fact, the Texas Education Agency is reporting that 282 school districts have requested emergency waivers to increase class sizes. That would be nearly a third of the state's 1,000-plus districts. Is the congressman right? His statistic checks out, we found, but it's unlikely that all the requests were driven by financial difficulties. Texas has capped the size of classes in kindergarten through fourth grade since 1984, when the Legislature passed a measure setting the limit at 22 students per teacher. The thinking at the time was that smaller classes would result in greater student achievement. But the caps had an out. Currently, a school district may receive a waiver if the state education commissioner finds the limit works an undue hardship on the district. In an interview, Texas Education Agency spokeswoman Debbie Ratcliffe told us that state education officials originally set two scenarios under which waivers would be granted: if a district were unable to hire enough teachers or lacked the classroom space to meet the 22:1 ratio. Later, she said, the agency added an additional factor — if a district had experienced unanticipated enrollment growth. From fall 1993 through spring 2010, the number of districts granted class-size waivers generally fluctuated between 90 and 150 each semester, according to information in two reports from the education agency. Ratcliffe told us that over the years, the agency approved virtually every waiver (request) that was submitted. To support Reyes' claim that the number of Texas school districts seeking waivers rocketed to 282 this school year, his office sent us a Jan. 3, 2012, El Paso Times article containing figures attributed to the state. As of Dec. 21, 2011, the article says, 282 districts had requested waivers for 1,643 campuses and 8,186 classrooms. When requesting a waiver, a district must designate how many classes at each campus will exceed the cap. Ratcliffe, confirming the 282 figure, told us that of those requests, 266 were granted outright while 16 districts were given partial approval, meaning some campuses could exceed the limit while others could not. The education agency generally rejected waivers for campuses rated academically unacceptable under the state's education accountability rating system, Ratcliffe said. As of Jan. 10, 2012, a total of 286 districts had sought class-size waivers. Of those, 270 — including the Austin, Del Valle, Eanes, Hays, Lake Travis, Leander, Manor, Pflugerville and Round Rock districts — had been granted waivers outright. That's an all-time high, Ratcliffe said. For comparison, she said, there were 168 waivers granted to districts in the 2010-11 school year. So, as of early 2012, district class-size waivers had increased 61 percent since the previous school year. Whats going on? Even before the 2011 legislative session began in January, state funding for education was expected to be stressed because of lawmakers' vow to balance the 2012-13 state budget without raising taxes. In addition to the $4 billion drop in formula-based funding to districts, lawmakers also did not renew about $1.3 billion in grant funding for education programs. Some districts had local funding problems as well, Ratcliffe said, as declining property values reduced property tax revenue. To help districts deal with the budget-tightening, lawmakers considered softening the 22-to-1 class-size cap. They did not agree on any change, but in the fall, Education Commissioner Robert Scott made it easier for districts to exceed the limit by adding financial hardship as a fourth reason districts could qualify for a waiver. Ratcliffe told us that this school year is unusual because some districts had enough classroom space to adhere to the class-size rule and had access to qualified teacher candidates, but still lacked the funds to hire them. Ratcliffe speculated that districts' financial difficulties are what led to the big uptick in waiver requests this school year. Another likely factor, she said, is that some districts built their budgets assuming that lawmakers would loosen the class-size cap — and when that didn't happen, they were too far along in budgeting for the year to adjust. We asked the education agency whether all the districts that had requested waivers as of early 2012 had cited financial hardship in their applications. Ratcliffe said the agency had not crunched the data that way. On Jan. 19, 2012, we looked at the data ourselves after generating a report on this school years waivers from the education agencys website. The report had 2,911 entries, one for each grade level of each school that would be affected by a waiver. For example, if a district received a waiver for kindergarten and fourth grade at one elementary school, there would be two entries in the report for that campus. Our overview: ** At least 163 school districts that had received waivers cited financial hardship as the reason for seeking the exception for at least one campus. That's 60 percent of the total number of districts that had received waivers as of early January. ** Some districts that requested waivers hadn't cited financial hardship as a reason, including Houston, the state's largest school district, which had received waivers for 441 grade levels over 146 campuses, and Austin, which had received waivers for 18 grade levels in 16 elementary schools. ** Some districts exclusively cited the financial hardship reason in their requests, including Dallas, which had received exceptions for 45 grade levels on 34 campuses, and Bexar County's Northside, which had received waivers for 150 grade levels on 63 campuses. Our ruling Reyes accurately recaps how many districts had requested class-size waivers from the state education agency as of late December 2011 — a number that subsequently grew. Yet, his suggestion that financial difficulties born from the 2011 Legislatures actions are responsible for all of the waiver requests is an overstatement, considering that historically, dozens of districts have sought and received waivers each year. Then again, 60 percent of districts that had received a waiver as of early January cited the new financial hardship reason when seeking permission to exceed the class-size law.",0.8,0.6,1.0,0.7,0.4,0.5,0.5,0.9,0.6,half-true

Donald Trump's strategy is real simple, Clinton told a crowd Oct. 29 in Daytona Beach, Fla. They have even said in his campaign it's to get women to stay home, get young people to stay home, get people of color to stay home, and get a lot of smart, intelligent men to stay home, too. Has Trumps campaign really said that? It turns out Clinton is referring to news articles that quote anonymous Trump advisers who say the campaign's strategy is to keep Clinton supporters home on Election Day by ratcheting up her negatives. Suppression? More like voter depression Clintons campaign pointed to news reports that quote anonymous Trump officials. The first example is a Bloomberg Businessweek article from Oct. 27 that takes readers behind the scenes of Trumps marketing operations. The article quotes a senior Trump campaign official saying that the campaign has three major voter suppression operations under way. The article doesnt offer any more details about the source other than the fact the person was a senior official. According to the Bloomberg story, the suppression operations are targeting white liberals, young women and African Americans through radio spots, social media and targeting specific neighborhoods. What specifically is Trump telling those groups? Clintons 1996 remark where she suggests some African-American males are super predators is being used in social media posts aimed at discouraging African-Americans from voting. The group of women who say they were sexually assaulted by Bill Clinton and degraded by Hillary Clinton are meant to dismantle young womens positive views of Clinton and so on. This isnt the only article that quotes an unidentified Trump adviser making a similar claim. Trumps advisers told the Wall Street Journal the campaign is trying to depress Democratic voter turnout. After news broke of Trumps 2005 lewd comments about sexual assault and women, the Trump campaign implemented a scorched earth strategy to keep voters home on Nov. 8, the Wall Street Journal reported. Just like what was reported in the Bloomberg article, Trump advisers told the Wall Street Journal that Trump was looking to use the attacks over Clintons email server and allegations about her husband to keep Clinton supporters home on election day. Theres also a Yahoo News article with a similar story from another unidentified source. Caveats There are caveats that come with Clintons claim. First, we cant independently verify if Trump officials said these things. Trump, himself, has said not to trust articles that dont name specific sources. Remember, don't believe sources said by the VERY dishonest media. If they don't name the sources, the sources don't exist. Also, publicly, Trump has gone to great lengths to court women and African-American voters. He has called for six weeks of mandatory paid maternity leave and tax credits for child care. And he has tried to attract African-Americans by touting his business plan, saying the Clinton and Democrats have failed. What the hell do you have to lose? said Trump, asking for black voters' support. Further, experts say what the media reports are describing are not all that shocking or atypical. In some ways, Clinton is describing modern-day politics warts and all. Tobe Berkovitz, an associate professor of advertising at Boston University, who has worked as a political media consultant for presidential campaigns, said its likely that Trumps campaign is trying to curb Clinton voters with negative campaigning. He said this is not unusual because modern politics based in negativity is an inherent part of campaigns, adding that negative campaigning discourages the hell out of all voters. If you look at Trumps strategy as negative campaigning, then it seems that Trump is not trying to suppress voters, but depress them. Our ruling Clinton said, Donald Trump's strategy is pretty simple. They have even said in his campaign it's to get women to stay home, get young people to stay home, get people of color to stay home, and get a lot get a lot of smart, intelligent men to stay home, too. Thats leaving a lot of details out. Trump never literally told women, young people, people of color and intelligent men, to stay home on Nov. 8. Clintons remark refers to news articles that quote anonymous sources from the campaign saying the strategy is to reduce turnout for Clinton by targeting specific groups of people, including young people, women and people of color. Yet Trump himself has tried to woo women and African-Americans on the campaign trail and said anonymous-sourced stories from his campaign should not be trusted. Lastly, experts say what Clinton is describing is a fairly typical type of negative campaigning. Clintons statement is partially accurate.",0.5,0.5,1.0,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,1.0,0.5,half-true

Final Rating: Half True  ",Says Donald Trump wants to kick thousands of kids off of BadgerCare.,"Addressing the Wisconsin Democratic Partys annual convention, U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin laid into Republicans, particularly President Donald Trump. You know, I remember Donald Trump coming to Wisconsin during the campaign and saying the same things Republicans always say here: Im on the side of the little guy, Im for working families, Ill fight for you, the Baldwin said on June 2, 2017. But it was another scam. Baldwin, a Democrat who faces re-election in 2018, then criticized several proposals backed by Trump, including the GOP replacement plan for Obamacare. He wants to kick thousands of kids off of BadgerCare, Baldwin charged, echoing comments she made a few days earlier on MSNBC. Who would cut health care for children? Lets see if shes right. What is BadgerCare? BadgerCare (also known as BadgerCare Plus) provides health insurance coverage to low-income Wisconsin residents, including pregnant women, childless adults and children. It is funded through Medicaid. The latest enrollment numbers, from May 2017, show 790,189 residents enrolled, including 412,208 children. Several days after Baldwins speech, GOP Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker proposed changes in the program for able-bodied adults, saying he wants to move them from government dependence to true independence, partly through drug testing. If the federal government gives Walker permission, Wisconsin would become the first state to do such drug testing. Under the plan, those who fail and refuse substance abuse treatment would have their coverage rejected. Baldwins evidence To back Baldwins attack on Trump, her campaign cited estimates made in May 2017 by two left-leaning research groups. The Wisconsin Budget Project, a program of the nonprofit Wisconsin Council on Children and Families, said in a blog post that a group of about 5,000 children in Wisconsin is particularly at risk of losing their eligibility for BadgerCare as a result of funding reductions to the Childrens Health Insurance Program that would be made under Trumps 2018 budget proposal. Jon Peacock, the groups research director, told us that while the budget would not dictate that children be removed from BadgerCare, Wisconsin would have to make up for the funding reductions in order to keep those children on BadgerCare. He said a total of 80,000 children would be put at risk of losing BadgerCare. The Washington, D.C.-based Center for American Progress made a longer-term estimate, saying 53,600 children would lose BadgerCare in 2026 because of Medicaid funding reductions proposed by the GOPs replacement for Obamacare that has been approved by the U.S. House of Representatives. That figure was based on estimates done by David Cutler, a professor of applied economics at Harvard University who was a campaign adviser to Barack Obama; and Emily Gee, a health economist at the center who formerly worked at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. Other evidence A spokeswoman for the Wisconsin Department of Health Services, which administers BadgerCare, said the department has not done a full analysis of Trumps budget or the GOP health plan, but told us the state is committed to ensuring that everyone living in poverty has access to affordable health insurance. The two estimates, however, include people with family incomes above the federal poverty level. So, they would not be covered by such a commitment from the Walker administration. Zach Hunter, a spokesman for a House committee that wrote much of the GOP replacement bill, said the bill contains tax credits that would provide families up to $14,000 a year to purchase insurance. He also said the Center for American Progress estimate is based on projections made by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, which he said has repeatedly struggled to estimate coverage impacts with accuracy when it comes to Obamacare. Our rating Baldwin says Trump wants to kick thousands of kids off of BadgerCare. The presidents budget proposal and the GOP replacement for Obamacare, which he supports, dont dictate that children lose their BadgerCare health insurance. But both would make cuts to federal spending that two left-leaning research groups say would threaten the BadgerCare eligibility of thousands of children.",0.5,0.5,1.0,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,1.0,0.5,half-true

Final Rating: Half True  ",What is the maximum number of students allowed in your classroom? ... 30 or more!,"A battle has erupted among parents, educators, taxpayers and politicians about how many students should be allowed in Florida classrooms.That battle will be waged on the Nov. 2, 2010, ballot when voters statewide will decide on Amendment 8, which would change the rules about class sizes that voters approved in 2002. Groups urging Floridians to vote yes or no have created catchy websites and mailers with photos of eager students, stern-looking teachers in crisp white button-down shirts and claims about what will happen to children's futures.In a related Truth-O-Meter, we examined a claim from a group pushing for passage of Amendment 8 about the number of empty classroom seats statewide. In this Truth-O-Meter, we will examine a claim by the groupopposingpassage of the amendment.In a mailer we saw Oct. 18, 2010, the Vote NO on 8 group wrote: Amendment 8 dramatically increases the number of students per class by at least 20%. In fact, some classes will have over 30 students! The other side of the flierresembles a test question and asks What is the maximum number of students allowed in your classroom? It shows five numbers crossed out ranging from 18 to 29 and a pencil broken in half, then states the answer: 30 or more!If Amendment 8 passes, will there be 30 or more students in a classroom?First, some background. The 2002 amendment was intended to limit classrooms to 18 students per teacher in kindergarten through third grade, 22 for fourth through eighth grade, and 25 for high school classes. The rules apply to core courses, and don't include some courses such as gym or band. The amendment was phased in over time -- last year schools could go over the limit as long as they met average class sizes for the school. This school year was the first timethat districts must meet the caps in each classroom.Amendment 8 would tweak the rules to allow class sizes to be measured based on school averages rather than on individual classrooms -- though there are also caps in terms of how many students can be assigned per teacher.To pass, the amendment needs 60 percent of the vote. Supporters of the amendment say the 2002 rules are too rigid and expensive to implement. According to the Florida Department of Education, districts have spent about $15.8 billion through the 2009-2010 school year on class size implementation statewide and are on track to spend an additional $2.9 billion for the 2010-2011 school year..But opponents say it's crucial to limit class sizes as the previous amendment intended.The Florida Department of Education has a handy website that explains how the rules would change if voters approve the constitutional amendment. The new rules state that the maximum class size would be calculated based on a schoolwide average in core classes:• 18 students in prekindergarten through grade 3;• 22 students in grades 4 through 8;• 25 students in grades 9 through 12.Also, the new rules would set the maximum number of students assigned to each teacher while not exceeding the schoolwide average:• 21 students in prekindergarten through grade 3;• 27 students in grades 4 through 8;• 30 students in grades 9 through 12.Note that the Department of Education says that if Amendment 8 passes, the maximum number of students per classroom would be 30 -- not more than30 -- and that figure only applies in grades 9 through 12. But it isn't as rigid as it seems.We asked Ingrid Olsen, spokeswoman for Vote NO on 8, how the group arrived at the 30 or more figure. Their conclusion is two-fold: one part has to do with those non-core classes such as physical education and band -- a simpler issue we will address first -- and the other part has to do with districts trying to game the system, Olsen says.The class size requirements of this subsection do not apply to extracurricular classes....,'' Olsen wrote in an e-mail Accordingly, a significant number of classes in all grade levels now do, and will continue to be able to exceed the maximum class size goals (i.e., it will not be unusual for those classes to vastly exceed 30 students; it occurs today).Thomas Butler, a spokesman for the Florida Department of Education, confirmed for us that the class size rules don't apply to non-core classes. But that's the case right now -- and will be the case whether Amendment 8 passes or fails.Olsen also wrote:In their attempts to comply with the class size requirements in the absence of the required funding from the state, we are hearing about school districts gaming the system; a practice which will become more widespread if Amendment 8 were to be enacted. Doubling up classes with a primary teacher and an associate teacher, renaming core classes to resemble non-core classes and carrying ghost teacher assignments on rosters, are practices which appear to be occurring today. Amendment 8 will cause increases in those actions.(No -- ghost teachers aren't educators who dress in scary costumes and distribute chocolate bars for Halloween. We'll explain who they are later.)We asked Olsen to point us to specific examples of districts taking such actions. Here are the people and sources she sent us to:• We interviewed Beverley Dowell, who teaches 5th grade language arts and other subjects at Treasure Island Elementary in North Bay Village in Miami-Dade County. Dowell told us that she has 41 students in one of her sections -- the most she has ever had during her on- and off-again teaching career that started in 1971. Dowell said she has a paraprofessional who assists her and sometimes another teacher.Miami-Dade school spokesman John Schuster confirmed Dowell's class size. He said she can have 41 students because the school's reading coach shares responsibilities with the teacher and a paraprofessional assists.• From an Aug. 21, 2010, article in the Miami Herald about schools facing the class size deadline: For a while, some districts considered ignoring the limits and paying millions in fines, figuring that would be cheaper than corralling enough teachers to make the teacher-student ratios work. In the end, most found creative ways to comply, such as offering more Internet-based virtual classes to older students and shifting athletic directors and media specialists into the classrooms to teach.• Several additional news sources across the state stated that some schools are using co-teaching or associate teaching (which adds a lower-paid educator to the classroom) to allow more students in each classroom since there is more than one educator. An Aug. 22, 2010, story in the St. Petersburg Times stated: Some schools have moved to co-teachers, effectively doubling the number of students they can house in a classroom.• A letter from T. Alan Cox, principal of Lawton Chiles High School in Tallahassee, told parents as the new school year approached that One adjustment that was made at Chiles that will allow a core class to have more than twenty-five students is the participation of more than one teacher per class -- a reference to him hiring associate teachers. (The letter we saw did not have a date but it starts with summer is quickly coming to a close.)And now, about those ghost teachers. Lynda Russell, a public policy advocate for the Florida Education Association who is aligned with the Vote NO side, said a ghost teacher refers to math or reading coaches who aren't assigned a classroom because they are floaters who assist students in need. Russell saidcoaches have been asked to sign paperwork showing they are responsible for a classroom -- though they are essentiallyassigned one on paper only,hence the reference to ghost. We asked her for proof that this is occurring and she said she obtained an e-mail from a union official in Osceola County from a coach who raised questions about this practice. We asked for the e-mail but have not received it.Right now we've got this limit that is not adhered to at 25, Russell said. So if Amendment 8 passes, we will have a cap that is not adhered to at 30.We asked Butler, the DOE spokesman, whether districts can use co-teaching to increase those caps on numbers of students in the classroom if Amendment 8 passes. He said co-teaching is allowed and pointed us to a statute that shows several other options including virtual instruction programs or use non-traditional school calendars or hours.If Amendment 8 passes, will there be 30 or more! students in classrooms?That depends. For starters, the class size issue is far too complicated for such a simple numerical claim without explanation on a mailer. The suggestion that there will be 30 or more! students in your classroom could suggest to the average reader that school classes could hit those numbers in any classroom no matter what subject or age. While there are certain ways that could occur, it's impossible to quantify at this point how often that will happen under Amendment 8.Yes, there will be more than 30 students in non-core classes -- but that's the case today. And the number 30 only applies to 9th through 12th grades -- the numbers are lower for younger children.But as the Vote NO group points out, districts across the state are experimenting with co-teaching this year that allows them to put two educators in a room and therefore more students than the caps. If they're doing that now, they could continue that practice if Amendment 8 passes.",0.5,0.7,0.9,0.6,0.4,0.6,0.5,1.0,0.5,half-true

Final Rating: Half True  ",Weve seen more filibusters on judicial nominees by the Republicans under President Obama than we saw in the whole history of the United States Senate.,"Republicans changed Senate rules to break a Democratic filibuster and confirm Neil Gorsuch to the U.S. Supreme Court, and blamed Democrats for necessitating the change along the way. Democrats, as you might imagine, saw it differently. In a post-mortem on the Senate showdown, Fox News Sundays Chris Wallace asked Sen. Ben Cardin, D-Md., whether the Democrats made a strategic mistake deciding to filibuster Gorsuchs nomination. Cardin said both parties are to blame, noting that Republicans engaged in the same type of action during President Barack Obamas first term, when Republicans held up Obamas judicial nominees. Weve seen more filibusters on judicial nominees by the Republicans under President Obama than we saw in the whole history of the United States Senate, Cardin said April 9. Both sides have blame here. We heard a similar claim on ABCs This Week. Former DNC pollster Cornell Belcher said Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell who blocked more of President Obama's nominees than have been blocked in history. Is that so? Defining, counting filibusters Cardin used the term filibuster, but measuring filibusters is troublesome, experts say, because it has an overly broad meaning. Senators tend to consider any type of obstruction to scheduling a nomination or measure as a filibuster, said Steven Smith, a political scientist at Washington University in St. Louis. The whole use of the term filibuster is problematic, given its evolution over the years, added University of Kansas political scientist Burdett Loomis. It ends up being a regular event, used all the more frequently in more partisan Congresses. As a result, experts say a way to approximate — but not entirely count — filibusters is to count the number of times the Senate attempts to break a filibuster by forcing an up-or-down vote through a process called cloture. In recent years, a cloture motion required the approval of 60 senators. But in 2013, Democrats changed the rules so that a simple majority could invoke cloture for presidential appointments and lower court nominees. The 60-vote threshold stood for legislation and the Supreme Court.  To confirm Gorsuch, Republicans eliminated the 60-vote threshold for Supreme Court nominees. It remains in place for legislation. What the research shows Cardins claim stems from a 2013 report by the Congressional Research Service, the independent research arm of Congress. The document, along with a subsequent memorandum on the report, lists every instance in which a presidential nominee was blocked and cloture was filed through Nov. 20, 2013, when Democrats changed Senate rules.  According to the Congressional Research Service, senators sought attempted cloture action on judicial nominations approximately86 times between 1967 and the end of 2013. (Pre-1967, the Congressional Research Service lists no cloture attempts -- so history as Cardin put it, is relatively short.) Of those, 50 were made before President Barack Obama took office in 2009, and 36 were made between 2009 and when the Senate changed its rules in 2013.Miguel A. Estrada, a judge nominated in 2001 to the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals, saw seven cloture attempts to break a logjam by Senate Democrats before withdrawing his nomination in 2003. So through that prism, Cardin is off. Cardin is closer if you look at individual judicial nominees who were subject to a cloture filing (because nominees like Estrada were subject to a cloture filing multiple times). Pre-Obama, 36 judicial nominees were subject to a cloture filing, we found. From 2009-2013, it was the same -- 36 judicial nominees. To put that in perspective, and to see Cardin's point, look at it this way: Less than one nominee per year was subject to a cloture filing inthe 40 years before Obama took office. From 2009-13, the number of nominees subject to a cloture filing jumped to over seven per year. In 2013, then-Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid was much closer to being correct when he said, In the history of the United States, 168 presidential nominees have been filibustered, 82 blocked under President Obama, 86 blocked under all the other presidents. His figure included non-judicial nominees. As part of that fact-check we noted that By our calculation, there were actually 68 individual nominees blocked prior to Obama taking office and 79 (so far) during Obamas term, for a total of 147. Senate Democratsmade that same point in a tweet April 6. (Cardin's team said Sen. Chuck Schumer's inquiry on the Senate floor was the basis of Cardin's claim.)  Sen. Schumer asked the Parliamentarian to confirm this fact. The Secretary of the Senate, confirms this. pic.twitter.com/pYPLT1DUt2 Our ruling Cardin said, Weve seen more filibusters on judicial nominees by the Republicans under President Obama than we saw in the whole history of the United States Senate. Cardin used an imprecise term, filibuster, to describe a precise Senate parliamentary procedure, cloture. Asfar as cloture data kept by the Congressional Research Service,Cardin would be on safer ground if he avoided focusing on judicial nominees. By our count, cloture was filed on 36 judicial nominations during the first five years of Obama's presidency, the same totalas the previous 40 years combined.",0.5,0.5,1.0,0.5,0.0,0.5,0.5,1.0,0.5,half-true

Final Rating: Half True",Says Joni Ernst claims she pushed for new funding for hospitals and COVID-19 testing after opposing It for weeks.,"The Iowa Democratic Party claims in its 2020 campaign against U.S. Sen. Joni Ernst, R-Iowa, that Ernst reversed her support for a coronavirus relief plan 3.5, which offered nearly half a trillion dollars for small businesses, hospitals and testing. The Iowa Democratic Party claimed in the headline of an April 21 statement that Ernst opposed funding for hospitals and COVID-19 testing for weeks before $75 billion to reimburse health-care providers and $25 billion for COVID-19 diagnostic testing was included in an interim coronavirus relief bill passed by the Senate April 21 and signed by President Trump April 24. Its a claim Democrats have continued to make against Ernst. Both Republicans and Democrats blocked interim economic relief packages proposed by the other party in April before the final half-a-trillion-dollar package cleared the Senate. The Republicans proposal wouldve solely funded the quickly depleted Paycheck Protection Program, a loan program created by the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act and launched April 4 for businesses that keep employees on their payroll. Democrats pushed for a $500-billion-dollar-plus aid package with Paycheck Protection Program funds as well as $100 billion for hospitals and $150 billion for state and local government, of which some of the hospital funds made it into the final deal. Iowa Democratic Party Communications Director Jeremy Busch referred in an interview with The Daily Iowan to a series of interviews and public statements Ernst made in April as proof her tune had changed on the expanded relief funding. As negotiations on refilling the Paycheck Protection Program were ongoing, Ernst said in an April 16 Fox News interview she supported the program and disagreed with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi that Congress should wait. We have small businesses that desperately need this funding to keep their employees on payroll. If they can't do that, those employees will go unemployed and that is not the route. So, I do believe that what we had was a narrowly crafted bill to replenish the funds for PPP, but the Democrats wanted to hijack it with unrelated items and additional changes. We have a program that's working, now we need to make sure that it's properly funded. In an email to the Daily Iowan's PolitiFact Iowa, Ernsts spokesperson, Brendan Conley, wrote that Ernsts comment on unrelated items and additional changes referred to an early House version of what eventually became the CARES Act, the third relief bill. The version Conley referred to was noted in a March 23 article in the Hill; it didnt clear the Senate but included funding to curb airline pollution. However, the Paycheck Protection Program launched after that article, on April 3, as part of the $2.2 trillion CARES Act, making it unlikely that the narrowly crafted bill to replenish the funds for PPP referred to the measure that created the loan program. The proposal that better fits what Ernst is describing in the Fox News interview wouldve bumped up funding for the Paycheck Protection Program. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, asked senators on April 9 to approve with unanimous consent a measure that would have added $250 million in federal funds to the Paycheck Protection Program. He argued on the Senate floor that the small business loan program's funds were running out and that negotiations for hospital, local government, and test funding should be part of a separate congressional package at a later date. The reason: the extra funding wouldnt pass unanimously, he said. However, McConnells measure did not receive unanimous consent, as two Democrats voiced opposition. No formal recorded vote was taken to gauge Senate support for the initial proposal, so there's no formal record of Ernst's support or opposition to that measure. Minutes after the two Democratic senators from Maryland rejected McConnells ask to fast-track the measure, the pair proposed their own amendment which was double the dollar figure of McConnells. It included $100 billion for hospitals dealing with COVID-19 and $150 billion for state and local governments. A final proposal to McConnells original interim bill included $500 billion for hospitals, the Paycheck Protection Program and COVID-19 testing, but none for local government. The Senate approved that measure April 21 with unanimous consent, a procedural fast-tracking move that means no senators voiced opposition. Again, the Senate didnt record a vote tally, but Conley wrote to the DI in an email that Ernst supported that half-a-trillion-dollar bill. A day before the final proposal was approved in the Senate, Ernst said in an April 20 town hall, that she supported the $3.5 coronavirus relief bills extra $75 billion to reimburse health-care providers and $25 billion for COVID-19 diagnostic testing. We will also get the additional dollars we wanted for diagnostic testing an additional $25 billion there as well as another $75 billion for our hospitals. And again this is something that Ive pushed for because we want to make sure that our rural hospitals are sustaining through this COVID-19 pandemic, Ernst said. Conley wrote in an April 24 email to the Daily Iowan: Sen.Ernst fully supports the additional funding for hospitals and testing —which are very much related to the COVID-19 pandemic — as she reiterated on Monday (April 20), and that's exactly why she supported the bill that passed the Senate this week. Her voting record shows, in no uncertain terms, that she supports those measures. In other statements as well before the final interim package passed, Ernst reiterated her support for a narrower agreement. According to a RadioIowa report, Ernst said April 16 that discussions about extra funding for hospitals and local governments could wait until Congress passed the PPP funds. No political gimmicks, just a simple ask to put more money in this program, RadioIowa reported Ernst saying. Unfortunately, politics got in the way. In a statement from Ernsts office April 9, the day Democrats and Republicans rejected each others interim relief plans, Ernst criticized Democrats for rejecting Republicans proposal, stating that passing small business loan relief funds was too urgent to delay. After hearing from Iowans and seeing the overwhelming response of small businesses across the country, its clear we need to bolster the Paycheck Protection Program. We dont have time for political games; were in a crisis. Workers and employers in Iowa and across the country need this relief now more than ever, so lets put aside the politics and swiftly get this specific additional support for small businesses approved so money can keep flowing, Iowa workers can continue to collect a paycheck, and our states small businesses can stay afloat, Ernst said. Congress put $350 billion toward the PPP at it's creation. The program stopped taking applications when the funds ran dry April 16 date, and resumed taking applications April 27. The interim package was one of several COVID-19 relief packages Congress has passed. The Iowa Democratic Party claimed that Ernst reversed her support for a coronavirus relief in a recent bill that offered nearly half a trillion dollars for small businesses, hospitals and testing. Due to a lack of concrete voting record, we reviewed Ernst's statements before and after the passage of the interim coronavirus-relief bill. Ernst hasn't said she directly opposed hospital funding, but in public statements she was critical of putting a proposal on the floor with funding that was more broad than the Paycheck Protection Program. When Democrats brought their version of the interim relief proposal, which included extra dollars for hospitals and local government, to the senate floor April 9, McConnell objected. Ernst is the Vice Chair of the Senate GOP Conference, meaning she is part of Republican leadership. However, she didnt vote down additional funds for hospitals or COVID-19 testing in the final half-a-trillion-dollar package. She said later she pushed for hospital funding included in the interim relief package. But, she never said she directly opposed that funding. Rather, she said it should be discussed at a later date. The claim is partially accurate but needs additional context. ",0.5,0.5,0.8,0.5,0.3,0.4,0.6,0.7,0.5,half-true

I would remind my colleagues that the American revolution was in no small part spurred by just such political pamphlets: Thomas Paine's Common Sense. To suggest that the government now has the power to suppress that kind of speech is breathtaking. Sessions' comment does get to the heart of the controversy surrounding the government's position on the case, but Sessions paints the substance of those arguments with a very broad brush and ignores the limits of the legal questions involved. The case before the Supreme Court challenged the application of a campaign reform bill known as the McCain-Feingold Act with respect to whether the nonprofit corporation Citizens United could air a video critical of then-presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. In a broader sense, though, the issue was whether the government had the authority to ban corporate or labor union funding of independent political broadcasts advocating for a candidate just prior to an election. In her oral arguments before the Supreme Court, Kagan argued that pamphlets were pretty classic electioneering, and therefore fell into the category of corporate-financed election materials that could be limited by the McCain-Feingold Act. Now, corporations could still form separate political action committees (PACs) to get their message out. But Kagan said she argued in favor of the position taken by Congress that corporations and labor unions had such a corrupting influence on elections that they should not be allowed to directly fund political messages for or against a particular candidate very close to an election. In a 5-4 decision, the Supreme Court went the other way, arguing that the First Amendment protects the speech of corporations and individuals alike. In his concurring opinion, Justice John Roberts wrote that the government's position asks us to embrace a theory of the First Amendment that would allow censorship not only of television and radio broadcasts, but of pamphlets, posters, the Internet, and virtually any other medium that corporations and unions might find useful in expressing their views on matters of public concern. So, right off the bat, we are talking about pamphlets directly funded by corporations or labor unions. That's a big qualifier left out of Sessions' comment. And Sessions' point is further muddled when he drops in the example of Thomas Paine's pamphlet Common Sense, -- which in 1776 argued for American independence from British rule. Paine's 48-page pamphlet was not corporate-financed, so it's technically not applicable in this discussion. And it might not have been even if it was. Solicitor Kagan was arguing that, under the Federal Election Campaign Act, corporate funds could not be used to publish a pamphlet that expressly advocated the election or defeat of a specific candidate for federal office, said Brett Kappel, an attorney specializing in ethics and lobbying law at the Washington, D.C.-based law firm Arent Fox. The Act would not have prevented Thomas Paine from publishing Common Sense since that famous pamphlet had nothing to do with candidates running for office. Today it would be considered an issue ad, not an electioneering communication. The Federal Election Commission doesn't regulate advertising unless it includes the name or image of a candidate for federal office, Kappel noted. Others argue that whether Common Sense was technically not corporate-financed is not the issue. Common Sense itself was probably not published by a corporation, but in today's world, it surely would have been, said Bradley A. Smith, Professor of Law at Capital University Law School. How many such efforts can you name that are not? The statement by Sessions was a bit of rhetorical excess, perhaps, said Sean Parnell, president of the Center for Competitive Politics, a campaign-finance advocacy group. Obviously, he said, Sessions could have added a good bit of context. Kagan never argued that the government could ban any pamphlet. Nonetheless, Parnell said, in the context of limited corporate-financed political messages, Sessions' comment accurately described Kagan's position that in addition to a video, the government could ban a pamphlet. During some close questioning by Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, on the Citizens United issue on the second day of the confirmation hearing, Kagan quickly framed the limits of the issue, stating that the statute ''applies only to corporations and unions when they make independent expenditures, not to their PACs ... within a certain period of an election. She also noted that as solicitor general, she was defending the statute as written by Congress, which made the determination broadly that corporations and trade unions had this corrupting influence on Congress. And the statute as it was written applies to pamphlets as well as to the movie in the case, and we made a vigorous argument that the application of that statute to any kind of classic electioneering materials, not books -- because they aren't typically used to electioneer -- but that the application of the statutes to any kinds of classic electioneering materials was in fact constitutional and that the court should defer to Congress' view of the need for this, Kagan said. Given the time constraints on opening statements, we are willing to allow Sessions a bit of rhetorical leeway. Kagan did argue that pamphlets should be included in the types of communication the government could prohibit. But again, that's in the context of pamphlets paid for directly by corporations or labor unions making independent expenditures (not through their PAC) for a pamphlet advocating for a specific candidate within the last months of an election. That's an awful lot of limiting context left out. And the point is further muddled by using the example of Paine's Common Sense. It's not at all clear that that pamphlet would have fallen under the regulation of the McCain-Feingold Act.",0.5,0.5,1.0,0.5,0.0,0.5,0.5,1.0,0.5,half-true

Final Rating: Half True  ",Dan Patrick got caught not paying his taxes and pocketed his employees payroll taxes.,"David Dewhurst says the Republican who led him in the March 2014 primary for the partys lieutenant governor nomination has a financially shaky background. Dewhurst, lieutenant governor since 2003, faces challenger Dan Patrick, a Houston state senator, in a May 27, 2014, primary runoff. In Dewhurst's video ad that came public April 16, 2014, the narrator said Patrick got caught not paying his taxes and pocketed his employees payroll taxes. In the ad, those claims are prefaced by an excerpt from a lieutenant governor debate in which a reporter said Patrick had walked away from more than $800,000 in debts when he declared personal bankruptcy. Patricks bankruptcy filing has been covered before. But did he get caught not paying taxes and also pocket employee payroll taxes? Backup from news story, tax liens Via the Quorum Report, a Capitol newsletter, we came to a Dewhurst web page on his ad attributing most of what he said to a Sept. 19, 2013, Dallas Morning News story on Patricks financial troubles. According to the News' story, Patrick filed for bankruptcy in October 1986 under his birth name, Dannie Scott Goeb, and walked away from about $800,000 in debts. The story said that years later, he legally changed his name to Dan Patrick. The bankruptcy was connected to a failed business venture. According to a January 2007 Texas Monthly story, Patrick and others in the 1980s had opened Dan and Nicks Sportsmarket, one of the first sports bars in the U.S. Located in tony Rice Village, the combination bar and restaurant was all polished brass and fine woods, full of local jocks and celebrities, TVs tuned constantly to sporting events. (Too constantly: The NFL would sue Patrick and five other bar owners in 1987 for showing blacked-out games.) For a while the business thrived, largely on the strength of Patricks personality, the story said, but he soon fell prey to the same financial lunacy that infected so many Houstonians in the early eighties. He bought another bar and restaurant, and then another, expanding, finally, to five. Then the oil bust hit, and in short order the man who had made $100,000 as a sportscaster closed four of his businesses, declared bankruptcy, and watched his annual income plummet to $10,000. Payroll taxes unpaid When Patrick filed for bankruptcy, the News story said, he listed more than $816,000 in debts and just over $104,000 in assets. Among his debtors, the story said, was the Internal Revenue Service, which Patrick owed $13,186 in federal income taxes withheld from his restaurant employees paychecks. By email, Dewhurst campaign spokeswoman Eliza Vielma sent us information indicating that from April 1986 into November 1988, Patricks companies were hit with five federal tax liens totaling $18,272.26--with unpaid employee payroll taxes comprising the bulk of that total. Vielma pointed out too that Patricks online response to the Dewhurst claim concedes he filed for personal bankruptcy and once owed payroll taxes. Patricks ad response states his bankruptcy filing doesnt prove he collected and pocketed the taxes, adding: This is not a defense; however, it is a technical distinction. According to Patrick, these taxes were ultimately paid and the debt to the federal government was settled. Generally, employers collect half of each employees payroll taxes and pony up the other half, with the resulting money going to the federal government for Medicare and Social Security. The essence of Dewhursts charge appears to be that Patrick pocketed payroll taxes paid by workers in failing to forward it to the IRS. The News story said Patrick also owed smaller amounts in property taxes to two Houston-area school districts, who later sued his companies for nonpayment. And his businesses were slapped with more than two dozen tax liens by federal, state and local governments. Patrick said he worked extra jobs and eventually paid off the IRS, the newspaper said, also quoting Patrick as saying he couldnt recall details of his bankruptcy cases closing in 1992. More than a decade later, as he got ready for his first bid for the Senate, the story said, Patrick cleared up all the tax liens through the secretary of states office. Patrick: Taxes paid up We asked Patricks campaign for relevant documentation. Logan Spence, his campaign manager, emailed us state and federal documents showing that in April 1986, an IRS administrator signed off on a lien against Patricks company of $15,356.68 for unpaid employee payroll taxes. Another document showed an IRS official approving a lien of $4,297.22 for unpaid federal income taxes. At our inquiry, the Morning News emailed us excerpts from Patricks bankruptcy case file. The provided 10 pages show Patricks bankruptcy filing was initiated Oct. 27, 1986 and was closed Oct. 22, 1992. Also, a document indicates, Patrick (whose legal name was then Goeb) was released from all dischargeable debts on May 4, 1987. But 941 taxes incurred by Watchbear, Inc., in 1985 and 1986 were still owed to the federal government, another document indicates, totaling $13,186.29--a figure that matches what the News story described as taxes withheld from restaurant employees pay checks. By phone, Spence noted the $13,186 figure on the bankruptcy filing was accompanied by the words less recent payment, which Spence described as referring to Patrick already paying some unpaid taxes. Saying all of Patricks debts associated with the bankruptcy of his restaurants have been settled, Spence also emailed a photo of a Nov. 5, 1990, letter from an IRS official to Patrick, whose legal last name remained Goeb, stating that $13,186.29 had been paid in full on Nov. 6, 1989. Spence also emailed documents indicating that in January and February 2006, then-State Comptroller Carole Keeton Strayhorn cleared Patrick of liens for sales taxes previously unpaid to the City of Houston and Metropolitan Transit Authority of Harris County totaling $11,717.73. At the time, Patrick was making his first run for the Senate. Experts say records inconclusive about 'pocketing' By email and telephone, a couple tax and accounting experts who looked over the News-provided documents at our request said they indicate Patricks company failed to submit payroll taxes to the government, though both said the documents did not demonstrate Patrick pocketed the employee shares of payroll taxes--or otherwise. Arthur Agulnek, who teaches accounting at the University of Texas at Dallas, said the 941 liens show Patrick failed to pay the payroll taxes to the IRS; he didnt pay it where it was supposed to go. Michael Harris, a professor of accounting at St. Edwards University, speculated: The money was very likely spent on other bills. Our ruling Dewhurst said Patrick got caught not paying taxes and pocketed employees payroll taxes. The first part of this claim is backed up by records showing the IRS filed liens because Patricks company didnt submit payroll taxes in parts of 1985 and 1986. Patrick also had liens filed against him for unpaid state and local sales taxes. Documents indicate Patrick caught up on his federal tax tab in 1989 and met his sales tax obligations in 2006, the year he ran for the Senate. We see no confirmation, though, that Patrick pocketed employees payroll taxes, though such taxes did go unpaid to the government at times.

Final Rating: Half True  ","A new manufacturing plant is slated to create about 3,000 jobs in central and northeast Georgia and create about a $3 billion infusion into the economy.","Primary Election Day is less than two months away, which means U.S. Rep. Paul Broun of Athens is busy burnishing his accomplishments.Broun marked the recent launch of his re-election campaign by saying his proudest achievement is helping to lure the manufacturer Caterpillar to the Athens area, where it will open a plant to make construction equipment, he said in a television interview.Caterpillars factory is going to create about 3,000 jobs here in central Georgia and northeast Georgia. Its going to be about a $3 billion infusion of cash into our economy, Broun said May 23 on WMGT-TV in Macon.Those numbers make it sound like Broun is doing a heck of a lot for his constituents. But is he padding his resume?Landing the 1 million-square-foot Caterpillar plant was a coup for Georgia. Gov. Nathan Deal announced the victory himself, and both his office and Caterpillar headquarters issued news releases that described the plants economic impact.Caterpillar will invest about $200 million to open the plant, and it expects to employ 1,400 people when it opens for business in late 2013, the Governors Office announced. In return, the state and its taxpayers are giving the company a $75 million package of incentives.PolitiFact Georgia called and emailed Brouns office for more than a week but received no replies. So we took to our own research and found that Brouns figures are problematic.First of all, Brouns figures dont match the estimates by Caterpillar.Caterpillars news release about the new facility cited economic impact figures from Sharon Younger, who runs a market research firm with headquarters in Jackson, Tenn., that also specializes in public relations.Youngers research was funded by Caterpillar, although she did not know what firm she was working for when she did her calculations, she told PolitiFact Georgia.Younger told PolitiFact Georgia that she estimated the impact for 12 counties that surround the plants site: Banks, Barrow, Clark, DeKalb, Gwinnett, Jackson, Madison, Morgan, Oconee, Oglethorpe, Rockdale and Walton.The Caterpillar plant will create more than 3,600 jobs for this area, and its economic impact will total about $2 billion in a single year when it starts running, Younger said. (In Caterpillars news release, she placed the impact at about $2.4 billion.)When compared with Caterpillars official estimate, Brouns job number is about 17 percent too low, while his economic impact number is about a half-billion dollars too high.Also, Brouns geography is wrong. Caterpillars impact figures are for counties in northeast Georgia only. None of the counties Younger considered are in Middle Georgia.Younger released only the bare outlines of her methodology, saying most of the information is proprietary. This means that no one can verify her numbers. Younger defended her estimates by saying that she used a standard method to make them. But that doesnt mean her estimates are correct. PolitiFact Georgia frequently writes about economic impact studies, and weve found that the information she did not release can make the difference between a credible study and one thats bunk.This is why:Researchers must predict how much a new factory will change economic activity in the local area in order to make an accurate economic impact estimate, according to the manual that outlines the method that Younger used and Bruce Seaman, an economist with Georgia State University. This prediction is crucial, Seaman said. If the Caterpillar plant gets all its parts and materials for its excavators from the Athens area, itll have a much bigger impact on the local economy than it would if it uses steel from China and electronics from Germany. Figuring out how much of this activity takes place locally can take a great deal of research. Younger said she did this work but did not detail how.Another impact estimate released by a University of Georgia expert is more conservative. Jeffrey Humphreys, the director of UGAs Selig Center for Economic Growth, said the economic impact would be $1.4 billion, according to an article in The Atlanta Journal-Constitution.For each job at the plant, 2.4 will be created across the state. Caterpillars estimate was for a smaller 12-county region.Humphreys was on leave and could not be contacted by deadline.How do we rule?Brouns jobs figure is lower than those released by Caterpillar, while the amount of economic impact he described is at least a half-billion dollars higher than the one the company gave.Broun also gave an incorrect description for the region covered by Caterpillars economic estimate. Its for northeast Georgia, not northeast and Middle Georgia. Caterpillars estimates were not peer-reviewed or conducted by an independent professional. Most importantly, the methodology behind them is not transparent.Brouns overarching point is this: The new Caterpillar plant will bring a lot of jobs and inject a lot of money into Georgias economy. But he strays on some of the finer points, and PolitiFact could not verify the methodology used to come up with some of the numbers.His estimates need a lot of context and clarification, even though his larger point has merit.We therefore rule Brouns statement Half-True.",0.5,0.5,1.0,0.5,0.0,0.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,half-true

Final Rating: Half True  ","In a period of roughly 72 hours, a small group of angry black students managed to force the resignation of the two highest ranking officials at that school.","A heated debate over race has erupted on several college campuses. This prompted Fox News host Megyn Kelly to lead off her show Wednesday this way: What started as a campus protest in Missouri might be spreading to more colleges and universities as small groups of students use complaints about race and diversity in a big play to rewrite the rules for everyone, Kelly said on the Nov. 11, 2015, edition of The Kelly File. In a period of roughly 72 hours, a small group of angry black students managed to force the resignation of the two highest-ranking officials at that school, complaining they did not show enough concern about racial issues at the school. There have been conflicting reports over what led Missouri University president Tim Wolfe and chancellor R. Bowen Loftin to step down Nov. 9. We thought it would help to examine Kellys summary that a small group of black students forced that much change in basically three days. The Fox News press office added some nuance to the short timeline Kelly cited. A spokesperson told us while tensions formed weeks ago, things came to a head in the three days before the resignations. Events did pile up quickly in the days before Nov. 9 but evidence coming out of Missouri paints a much more complicated picture than the one Kelly offered her viewers. Most importantly, Wolfe and Loftin fell for different reasons. Race relations were the dominant factor in Wolfes demise, but Loftins problems stemmed from a revolt among the universitys deans that peaked a month earlier. It also seems that opposition to both men was broader than, as Kelly said, a small group of angry black students. The standard (simple) storyline Fox News told us that a Google search pulled up more than 8,000 news articles about the role of the students in the resignations. The stories we read generally noted the same series of events leading up to the administrative shake-up at Mizzou. In mid September this year, the president of the Missouri Student Association wrote on Facebook that riders in a pick-up truck had repeatedly used a racial slur toward him. In early October, as a black student group rehearsed outdoors for a homecoming performance, a passing white student began using a racial slur. A few days later on Oct. 10, about a dozen black students surrounded the Missouri presidents vehicle demanding that he address racial tensions on campus. Roughly two weeks after that, feces smeared in the shape of a swastika appeared on a college dorm. No suspect was found. On Nov. 2, a black student started a hunger strike. On Nov. 7, a group of black players on Missouris football team announced they would neither practice nor play until Wolfe, the president, resigned. Missouri football coach Gary Pinkel tweeted his support for the players strike Nov. 8. On Nov. 9, both Wolfe and Loftin resigned. (Loftin said he would remain with the university in a different role.) Its easy to understand why the downfall of the two men would merge in the public mind, but that doesnt make it accurate. Loftins long decline Its important to note that Loftin answered to Wolfe. As university president, Wolfe oversaw the entire university system. Loftin ran all of the academic divisions of the university, from the medical school, to the law school, to the college of arts and sciences, and more. You dont have to look far to discover that Loftins relationship with large swaths of the university community was on the rocks for reasons having nothing to do with the bubbling racial tensions. In fact,nine of the universitysdeansin charge of academic divisions asked for Loftins removal a month before he stepped down.(Interim and acting deans did not participate.) We said to the president on Oct. 9 that Loftin should go, Dave Kurpius, dean of the Journalism School told PunditFact. Kurpius said the deans repeated that demand to Wolfe at three meetings in early October. The morning Wolfe resigned in November, they had just sent a letter to Wolfes boss, the board of curators, calling for Loftins removal. That letter blamed Loftin for creating a toxic environment through threat, fear and intimidation. Their specific issues involved his botched effort to eliminate graduate assistant health insurance and a total disregard for their roles as managers of their academic centers. Graduate students also had been opposing Loftin. Sarah Senff is co-chair of the Action Committee on the Forum on Graduate Rights. The group was formed in August after Loftin gave them less than a days notice that they would lose their health insurance assistance. After an outcry, Loftin reversed himself. I would vociferously deny that this happened in 72 hours or that this was just black students,  Senff said. Particularly for Chancellor Loftin, there were numerous issues relating to his competence to lead the university. Senff and other graduate student leaders we contacted cited a bevy of problems including cutbacks in aid for housing, childcare, and tuition waivers. They also rejected Loftins decision in September to sever ties with a Planned Parenthood clinic where medical and nursing students had been going to fulfill hands-on experience requirements. Senff said it has been a semester thathas seen protest after protest from various groups. The graduate students woes spilled over to the academic departments. William Kerwin is director of graduate studies at Missouris English department. On Nov. 3, the faculty voted to declare No confidence in Loftin. Their complaints mirrored those of the deans and graduate students. A whole host of issues were in play regarding Chancellor Loftin, Kerwin said, Yet the national narrative now sees his departure as driven by the same forces as ended President Wolfes tenure here. It is not as though this story was unknown outside of Missouri. The day before Kellys show, the Wall Street Journal published an article with the headline Race Wasnt the Only Issue at University of Missouri. Wolfes sudden demise University of Missouri insiders we contacted uniformly told us that race relations were the driving factor in Wolfes resignation. Several highlighted his refusal to engage with black students after the incidents in September and October. That precipitated the moment when a dozen activists surrounded his car at the October homecoming. When Wolfe told a group of black students on Nov. 7 that systematic oppression is because you dont believe that you have the equal opportunity for success, the uproar only intensified. Eric Scott, a graduate student leader, said its accurate to say a core group of black students organized protests. But Smith, who is white, said that hardly captures the extent of the popular rejection of Wolfe. If we count all the people who have participated in their marches and demonstrations, there were hundreds of members, Smith said. Hardly a small group of angry black students.  Samuel Cohen is an associate English professor. He said Kelly had it right regarding the general role of the students and racial tensions. What she missed, he said, was the two or three months of growing frustration and the upswell of support for his ouster. The tipping point, Cohen said, was the football players who put their scholarships and careers on the line. It is technically correct to say it was a small group of students, but if they had been protesting the campus smoking ban or the chancellor's twitter handle, it wouldn't have led anywhere. he said. It had to be something important that many others saw as worth fighting against. The others who joined in, Cohen said, included students, faculty and staff of many ethnicities. Our ruling Kelly said in a span of about three days, a small group of black students forced the resignations of two top administrators at the University of Missouri. Multiple press reports and interviews with members of the Mizzou community tell us Kellys shorthand falls short on several key points. Deans, graduate students, and faculty had been pressing for the ouster of Loftin for at least a month prior to his departure. It is no small matter for deans to make such a demand and they did so three times in early October. Loftins problems with the university community go back well into the beginning of the semester. Theres more support for the role of black students in the removal of Wolfe. The evidence tells us that pressure from black students was the driving force and the momentum shifted rapidly against him when a student went on a hunger strike on Nov. 2. However, anger had been growing since midOctober and a much larger number of people from across the university community joined the call for Wolfe to step down.

Final Rating: Half True  ","In 2002, Iran was more or less an American ally.","President Barack Obamas State of the Union address fueled an extended political pre-game show that almost rivaled the chatter ahead of the Super Bowl. Every network fielded experts to assess what the president might say, why he would say it, and what could happen next. On the afternoon of the speech, MSNBCs Andrea Mitchell was deep in conversation with MSNBC political director Chuck Todd and Washington Post political reporter Chris Cillizza. The three agreed that despite the hype, these speeches deliver few surprises. But Mitchell said in her mind, the great exception came in 2002 when President George W. Bush named Iran, North Korea and Iraq as part of an axis of evil. Up until that moment, Iran was cooperating with the United States on the border of Afghanistan, Mitchell, MSNBC's chief foreign affairs correspondent, said. Post 9/11, Iran was more or less an American ally. By being included in the axis of evil, it turned the Iranian government in a completely different direction. It was a turning point in American politics and in foreign policy. To say Iran and American ally in the same breath drew ridicule from the conservative community. The website Townhall.com wrote of Mitchells stunning historical ignorance. Breitbart.com called her claim a delusion. For this fact-check, we go to the record to assess whether in January 2002 Iran qualifies as more or less an American ally. A tortured relationship Ties between the U.S. and Iran have been troubled for over 50 years. With the help of the CIA and the British, a coup toppled Irans elected leader in 1953 and led to the autocratic control by the Shah, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi. An Islamic fundamentalist revolution displaced the Shah in 1979, producing the famous hostage crisis with American embassy staff. The U.S. has had no embassy in Iran since. Over the decades, there have been episodes when tensions between the two countries eased, but the dominant climate has been one of profound distrust if not outright hostility. The U.S. backed Iraqs Saddam Hussein in his war with Iran. Iran supported the Hezbollah in Lebanon as a military surrogate to strike at Israel. In recent years, the desire to shut down Irans nuclear program has defined American policy toward the Middle Eastern nation. With that background, it would come as a surprise to ever characterize Iran as anything approaching a partner of the United States. But if there was such a moment, it was immediately after the Sept. 11 attacks on American soil. The enemy of my enemy Iranian and American interests dovetailed in Afghanistan, which lies along Irans eastern border. Iran viewed the Taliban as a threat. For many, many years, the Iranians backed the Northern Alliance, the opponents to the Taliban, said Hossein Askari, a professor at George Washington Universitys Elliott School of International Affairs. The Northern Alliance became Americas wedge into Afghanistan in an offensive that overthrew the Taliban in a matter of weeks. Askari said Iran had boots on the ground in those attacks. Iran had its military advisers within the Northern Alliance forces, Askari said. I was told they fought side by side. To block a resurgent Taliban, both Iran and the U.S. wanted to establish a strong centralized government in Afghanistan. This required a partnership between two ethnic groups, the Tajik leaders of the Northern Alliance and the Pashtuns of Hamid Karzai. But the Northern Alliance was not interested. According to a RAND report prepared for U.S. Marine Corps, Iran brought the two sides together. Iranian political pressure on Northern Alliance leaders during negotiations in Bonn, Germany, persuaded them to reach a compromise and agree to the formation of the new government, the RAND report said. Soon after Sept. 11, Iran also helped the U.S. with al-Qaida. This also fit with Irans interests. Al-Qaida is on the other side of the religious divide that splits the Arab world. Al-Qaida is Sunni while Iran is Shia. Iran gave no harbor to members of the terrorist organization. They turned al-Qaida operatives out of their country, Askari said. A former Bush administration official told the Associated Press that Iran copied the passports of about 300 of those operatives and sent them to the United Nations where they were handed over to the Americans. Temporary partners, not allies While all of these moves put Iran and the U.S. on the same side, Askari would not goes as far as Mitchell suggested. I totally disagree that they were allies, Askari said. Their interests merged on this one issue, the Taliban and al-Qaida in Afghanistan. Iran wanted to have a say in what happened in Afghanistan. But on other issues, they kept their distance. As an historical note, Askari believes the Iranians became most interested in a new relationship with the U.S. only when American forces rapidly drove Saddam Hussein out of power. They were shaking in their boots, Askari said. They really thought that if the U.S. could do that to Saddam Hussein so quickly, they could be next. But whatever overtures Iran made at that moment were met with no response from the Bush administration. Our ruling Mitchell said that in 2002, Iran was almost an ally of the United States. While Iran provided critical assistance in the military defeat of the Taliban in Afghanistan and helped undermine al-Qaida, this cooperation did not reflect deeper ties. It was a moment when both countries sought similar goals in one country. Mitchells point was the Bush administration squandered an opportunity. That might have merit, but there is no fact-checking a hypothetical situation. What we can assess is the degree to which Iran was more or less an ally.",0.5,0.5,1.0,0.5,0.2,0.5,0.4,1.0,0.4,half-true

Final Rating: Half True  ","Ohio lost 400,000 jobs on his (Ted Stricklands) watch.","Like the refrain of a ubiquitous pop song, the phrase -- Ohio lost 400,000 jobs on his watch -- is playing over and over on the airwaves. And like any good lyric, the phrase is catchy.Republican U.S. Senate candidate Rob Portman sings it about his Democratic challenger Lee Fisher, who is Ohios lieutenant governor and former head of the states economic development department. Republican gubernatorial candidate John Kasich sings it about incumbent governor Ted Strickland.Now the Republican Governors Association has made the phrase the central theme of three commercials attacking Strickland on behalf of Kasich.Ohio lost 400,000 jobs on his watch, is the opening line for one of the ads.With the phrase getting aired so often, we thought it was time to check the accuracy of the playlist.The Republicans are referring to the states net job losses since Strickland -- and by extension Fisher -- took office in January 2007. Ohio lost 386,600 non-farm jobs from January 2007 through June of this year, the latest figure available. So Republicans are largely accurate when they say Ohio has lost 400,000 jobs since January of 2007. Job losses were as high as 438,900 at the end of February of this year.But the claim breaks down when Republicans suggest that the governor -- or any one official -- is responsible for the job losses.Ohio has been losing jobs since January of 2000 - 568,300 according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Of those, 403,800 came in the manufacturing sector. Its also worth noting, since campaigns are trying to blame those in charge when the state lost jobs, that Republicans held the governors office seven of those years and held both houses of the legislatures until January 2009. Republican George W. Bush was president for eight of those years.Strickland argues that Ohio - like Michigan and other Midwest states -- was especially hurt by forces beyond his control, namely a recession and the decline of manufacturing. Ohio and the nation have suffered through two recessions, one that started in 2001 and one that started in 2008, which triggered an avalanche of job losses here and was considered a global economic crisis.Strickland is not the only one making this argument.Indiana Gov. Mitch Daniels, a Republican elected in 2004 who is in his second term, says the same thing, at least he did July 22 during an interview in Cleveland. What makes the Daniels comments worth highlighting is that the rising GOP star was in town campaigning with Kasich. The two were beating up on Strickland for the states job losses.But Daniels became a bit defensive when questioned about Hoosier State less than stellar performance in the last several years. Indiana lost 174,000 net jobs since January of 2007 and the state has a current unemployment rate of 10.1 percentage points compared to Ohios 10.5 rate.In a time when every state that is not sitting on a pile of natural gas is struggling, you bet we are, Daniels said. He argued that Indiana is adding jobs faster than other states and its business climate is better than Ohios. But, echoing the sentiments of other governors in defense of their states economic woes, he said, To some extent, everybody is at the mercy of national and global events, and we are no different.Thats right. Daniels delivered the line that many Democrats make to defend themselves from the charge that the states job losses are all their fault.So even if the campaign phrase -- Ohio lost 400,000 jobs on his watch -- is stuck in a voters head, the claim does not reflect the larger economic backdrop, one that both Democrats and Republicans in charge of states admit produced results out of their control.If the roles were reversed, and Ohio were led by a Republican governor and it was Democrats making the accusation, our rating would be the same.We find the Republican Governors Association claim to be Half True.

Final Rating: Half True",Less than half of jobs at the Carrier manufacturing plant in Indiana are actually staying.,"Supporters of Donald Trump have praised the president-elect for working out a deal to keep jobs at a manufacturing plant in Indiana from being moved to Mexico. Appearing on NBCs Meet the Press Dec. 4, Vice President-elect Mike Pence said the deal with Carrier, which makes heating, air conditioning and refrigerator parts, meant more than a thousand Hoosiers have certainty in their jobs and in their futures going into this Christmas season because of the leadership of Donald Trump. Later in the show, pundits from the left and right raised concerns that painted the deal in a less twinkling light. National Review editor Rich Lowry said the government incentives involved were not ideal, and he doesnt like Trump threatening to retaliate against businesses with tariffs for moves he disapproves of. Heather McGhee, president of the left-leaning think tank Demos, said the number of saved jobs is overhyped. Did you actually read the Carrier letter? McGhee asked the panel. It started out saying we are pleased to inform you and ended up talking about all the jobs that would still be shipped overseas. The numbers I'm looking at say less than half of them are actually staying. With so many numbers in the mix, we decided to see if McGhees claim hadmerit. McGhee was talking about aletter related to1,400 Carrier jobs in Indianapolis. Most jobs, but far from every job,at the Indianapolis plant ended up being saved thanks to the deal with Trump's team. The outlook worsens when you factor in that plant's joblosses with another Indiana plant slated for closure and owned by Carrier's parent company. The making of a promise In February, United Technologies, the parent company for Carrier Corporations,announced it would be closing an Indianapolis Carrier plant and moving its 1,400 jobs to Monterrey, Mexico. Trump talked about the news throughout his campaign, using Carrier as an example of how trade deals like NAFTA have destroyed the manufacturing industry. We're not going to let Carrier leave, Trump said in Indiana, of which Pence is governor, in April. Because say what you want, Indiana. I've been talking about Carrier now for four months, right? About three weeks after the general election, Carrier confirmed talks with Trump and Pence but did not elaborate. Carrier has had discussions with the incoming administration and we look forward to working together. Nothing to announce at this time. Five days later, Trump tweeted that a deal had been struck, jobs had been saved, and his promise to Americans had been fulfilled. Big day on Thursday for Indiana and the great workers of that wonderful state.We will keep our companies and jobs in the U.S. Thanks Carrier We are pleased to have reached a deal with President-elect Trump & VP-elect Pence to keep close to 1,000 jobs in Indy. More details soon. The state of Indiana vowed to give the company $7 million in tax incentives over a decade, and the company agreed to invest $16 million in keeping the company in the state. While many workers celebrated saving their jobs, free-market capitalists balked, including Trump ally and Republican Sarah Palin, who described the deal as crony capitalism. Lost in the jubilation was that hundreds of jobs at the Carrier plant would not be spared from export. On top of that, Carrier's parent company, United Technologies, said it will continue with previously announced plans to close a factory in Huntington, Ind., and move its 700 jobs to Mexico. Behind the numbers So how does McGhees statement add up? The best numbers available can be reasonably examined a couple ways. We could not reach a spokesperson for United Technologies for comment Sunday, so we're going by reported estimates inthe Washington Post, New York Timesand the Wall Street Journal, among others. The first way to add up the number — which doesnt support McGhees point — is by looking just at Carrier jobs. Again, more than 1,400 Carrier jobs were heading to Mexico before the incoming administration intervened. Multiple reports put the number of saved jobs from that plantat 800 union workers, mainly those involved with buildingfurnaces. So thats more than half, or 57 percent, of the estimated 1,400 jobs that were slated to be lost from the Indianapolis plant. Thats a bit lower than the more than 1,000 jobs talking point weve heard from Pence, Trump and Carrier. According to CNNMoney, that total is inflated by factoring in 300 primarily administrative and engineering jobs held by parent company United Technologies that were not at risk of moving to Mexico. The letter that McGhee talked about on the show was sent to employees Dec. 1. Carrier said it would move forward with its earlier plan to relocate its fan coil manufacturing lines out of the country.  Breaking: Carrier confirms in letter to workers that fan coil jobs will relocate to Mexico by end of 2017. @rtv6 @IndyThisWeek pic.twitter.com/pcHo5ZPuh4 While this announcement is good news for many, we recognize it is not good news for everyone, reads the letter. We are moving forward with previously announced plans to relocate the fan coil manufacturing lines, with expected completion by the end of 2017. While the letter doesnt use specific numbers, news reports have said that the fan coil relocation will cost 600 U.S. jobs. And theres more to the story. The incoming administration was not able to work out a deal to prevent the closing of United Technologies'Huntington factory. So 700 of those jobs will be outsourced to Mexico. So between the U.S. job losses at the factories in Carrier andHuntington, approximately 1,300 jobs willbe moved to Mexico under theumbrella of United Technologies. Going by the broader view, McGhee is right that less than half (or 38 percent) of the 2,100 jobs in danger of being exported actually ended up staying. Our ruling McGhee said that less than half of the jobs from the Carrier deal actually stayed in the United States.  If you just count the number of jobs at the Carrier plant, which is what Trump promised to save and what McGhee referenced on the show, then her claim is not accurate. In fact, more than half of the jobs will stay in the United States because the deal is keeping approximately 800 jobs out of 1,400at the Carrier plant. However, herstatement is correct when applied more broadly to include jobs that will be lost from the United Technologies' factory closure in Huntington, as well as the hundreds of jobs not saved in the Carrier deal. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/228c9aa4-bea8-420d-b946-dd81fe8327f9",0.5,0.5,1.0,0.5,0.0,0.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,half-true

Final Rating: Half True  ",Cuba has a lung cancer vaccine we in the US had no access to because we sanctioned Cuba.,"Online supporters of Bernie Sanders came to his defense on the issue of Cuba, touting the communist island nations accomplishments beyond improving literacy rates. Cuba has a lung cancer vaccine we in the US had no access to because we sanctioned Cuba, the Feb. 24 post said. Cuba eliminated HIV transmission from mother to child. Cuba has a literacy rate of nearly 98% now. The post was flagged as part of Facebooks efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Well focus on the claim about the lung cancer vaccine because the facts behind the statement lead to a less certain conclusion than the Facebook post suggests. (The other elements in the post are accurate.) Though we tend to think of vaccines as protecting you from getting sick, cancer vaccines work differently. In 2016, nearly 150,000 people died from lung cancer in the United States. Neither the United States nor Cuba nor anyone else has developed a vaccine that would stop those deaths. Thats because cancer vaccines dont block disease; their purpose is to shrink existing tumors, and failing that, slow them down. There are 91 lung cancer vaccines under study today in the United States, according to the National Institutes of Health. During the 1990s, Cuba began testing a drug called Cimavax and found that it extended lung cancer patients lives by about three months. In 2011, Cuba began offering the drug to Cubans for free. That same year, Cuban researchers discussed the results with the Roswell Park Cancer Institute in Buffalo, N.Y. Four years later — the same year that the United States and Cuba re-opened embassies in each others capitals — scientists from both countries agreed on a collaborative research project. It was the first time since the Cuban revolution that Cuban and American institutions had been permitted to engage in such a joint venture, Roswell Parks chief executive, Candace S. Johnson told the New York Times. The initial results in Cuba were ambiguous, and they needed to be replicated in the United States to meet Food and Drug Administration rules. Ultimately, the Roswell Park study hopes to have 180 patients. These are people with advanced cancer who have exhausted other treatments. So far, the study has not met its goal. Approximately 100 people have gone to Cuba on their own for treatment. With about 200,000 new cases of lung cancer each year, the fraction of patients accessing Cimavax is about one tenth of one percent. When the Trump administration re-imposed restrictions on travel to Cuba, it created a legal bind for Americans — about 100 since 2016 — who have gone there for this treatment. According to the new rules, they were now breaking the law. But this highlights that opening the doors to Cuba also increased access to the drug, although access was limited to patients who could afford to make the trip. A Facebook post said Cuba had a lung cancer vaccine that the United States had no access to due to the decades-long embargo. There is an element of accuracy here, but it lacks several important pieces of information. A lung cancer vaccine doesnt prevent the disease; it is judged a success if it slows down or stops tumor growth. The drug in this case, Cimavax, extended life by about three months in the Cuban study. Access to Cimavax is limited to about 180 patients in one American study and those who go on their own to Cuba. The combined total represents a tiny fraction of people with lung cancer. There are about 90 cancer vaccines under study in America today. None of this would be apparent to people who read the Facebook post.",0.5,0.5,1.0,0.5,0.0,0.5,0.5,1.0,0.5,half-true

Final Rating: Half True",Says President Obama has cracked down on employers who are attracting undocumented immigrants and hiring them more than any previous president.,"President Barack Obama is the boss-buster in chief when it comes to going after employers who hire undocumented workers, according to U.S. Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, D-Fla. President Obama has the most border patrols and border security deployed at the border of any previous president, said Wasserman Schultz, in a June 20 interview on MSNBC. Obama has cracked down on employers who are attracting undocumented immigrants and hiring them more than any previous president. In a related fact-check, we gave Wasserman Schultz, who also serves as the Democratic National Committee chair, a Mostly True for her claim about border patrol and security. Here, we will explore if Obama holds the record for cracking down on employers who hire undocumented immigrants. Workplace raids vs. paperwork raids For some background, we turned to the Migration Policy Institute, a think tank that studies worldwide migration. Their 2013 paper about the history of immigration enforcement includes a chapter on workplace enforcement. We also found some background in a 2010 investigation from the Orange County Register. After multiple efforts, Congress passed the 1986 Immigration Reform and Control Act, which stated that employers couldnt knowingly hire unauthorized workers. Employers must attest that they made a good faith effort to verify the eligibility of workers by completing an I-9 form. The documents are easy to counterfeit, so the federal government developed an online employer verification system in the 1990s under President Bill Clinton, and the use of it soared after 2007. That system, now known as E-Verify, is currently voluntary, though some states mandate it for certain employers. (The Corker-Hoeven amendment to the Senate immigration bill would make it mandatory.) E-Verify spending dramatically increased under President George W. Bush and Obama. Still, immigration rules have proved difficult to enforce. As of 2010, about 8 million unauthorized immigrants worked in the United States. The federal governments worksite enforcement strategy has changed over time as well, making it difficult to compare data and declare any president the leader in cracking down on employers, experts across the political spectrum told us. At times, members in Congress have called for stiffer workplace enforcement. But when the reality hit home in their districts and led to complaints from business owners, politicians urged the federal government to ease up, according to border expert and University at Albany professor Rey Koslowski. Thats why border security has been more politically popular to fund than worksite enforcement. (We should note that a significant percentage of people working illegally don't cross the border; they simply overstay their visas.) Doris Meissner, the Immigration and Naturalization Service commissioner Clinton, called worksite enforcement a bit of a third rail. (She is one of the authors of the Migration Policy Institute paper. The Immigration and Naturalization Service is now called Immigration and Customs Enforcement, known as ICE.) Under Bush, workplace raids on factories and meatpacking plants received much attention. But after Obama took office, the Department of Homeland Security unveiled a new strategy and ditched the workplace raids, which also tended to punish employees, in favor of paper raids -- I-9 paperwork audits of employers to determine if they complied with employment eligibility verification laws. ICE will focus its resources within the worksite enforcement program on the criminal prosecution of employers who knowingly hire illegal workers in order to target the root cause of illegal immigration, Homeland Security chief Janet Napolitano said in April 2009. The change was dramatic: the number of I-9 audits soared from 503 in 2008 to more than 8,000 in 2009. Under Obama, ICE announced sanctions against major employers. That included a $1 million fine gainst Abercrombie and Fitch that grew out of an I-9 inspection in November 2008 while Bush was president, and the termination of hundreds of workers at Chipotle restaurants. In 2007, ICE arrested 92 employers, while in 2012 it arrested 240, according to ICE. Final orders -- rulings at the end of the case which show employers violated hiring rules -- also increased under Obama. In 2007, there were two final orders, while in 2012 there were 495. But Obama doesnt hold a record on final orders against employers. The numbers of final orders hit higher numbers in the 1990s. Those 495 final orders under Obama were consistently exceeded between 1992 and 1998, with a peak 1,063 final orders in 1992, according to data from the governments Immigration Statistics yearbook. Wasserman Schultz spokesman Jonathan Beeton sent us news reports showing an increase in I-9 audits and fines under Obama compared to Bush. (We were unable to obtain I-9 audit statistics from the 1990s, so we dont know if Obama holds the record merely over Bush.) Still, I-9 audits arent the only way to measure immigration enforcement. While audits have soared under Obama, other metrics have fallen, including arrests of employees, said Jessica Vaughan, director of policy studies at the Center for Immigration Studies, which favors restricting immigration. Thats not a surprise, since Obama turned the focus away from the workers and toward employers. However, by ignoring the workers, they are choosing to cut off a line of inquiry to nail employers, Vaughan told PolitiFact in an interview. We asked Vaughan if she thinks Wasserman Schultz was correct to state that Obama holds the record on enforcement of employers. It depends on which metric you choose, she said. If your metric is the number of audits, yes. If your metric is bringing cases to prosecution that seriously punish employers, to the point where I would say there would be a deterrent effect, I would strongly disagree with her statement. Additionally, I-9 audits are not a complete or perfect measurement of worksite enforcement against employers who hired illegal workers, said former U.S. Rep. Bruce Morrison, D-Conn., who chaired the immigration subcommittee from 1989 to 1991. Morrison now lobbies on immigration matters and has informally advised hospitals and other businesses that have faced I-9 audits. He described some of the I-9 audits as paperwork snafus -- for example an employer who didnt check the right box. If there are no illegals, you are more likely to be cut a break on penalties than if you hired a lot of illegals, but you get fined anyhow... he said. Trying to say who is being tougher on this aspect of enforcement I think is kind of a silly discussion, because what were people fined for? And did that help prevent unauthorized employment or not? We also interviewed Carl Hampe, an attorney at Baker McKenzie who has represented employees in immigration cases since the 1990s and was an attorney for the Senate committee that drafted the 1986 law. Hampe said that Wasserman Schultzs claim is not inaccurate, but given the changing enforcement strategies, its not quite that black and white. In the 1990s, INS handled a higher number of civil cases, while Bush focused on criminal investigations against employers and workers. Obama has pursued civil audits and criminal investigations against employers. Its hard to say whether Bush 43 or (Obama) is the hands-down winner, he said. Our ruling Wasserman Schultz said that Obama has cracked down on employers who are attracting undocumented immigrants and hiring them more than any previous president. She used the word employers and not employees here for a reason: Obama shifted away from Bushs strategy of workplace raids and turned the focus on employers. Between 2008 and 2009, immigration audits soared from 503 to more than 8,000. But other metric tell a more nuanced story. Final orders against employers, for example, were higher in the 1990s than they are now.",0.5,0.5,1.0,0.5,0.0,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,half-true

Final Rating: Half True  ",Said that his batting average with Congress is higher than every other president since Dwight D. Eisenhower except Lyndon Johnson.,"Thirty years since losing the White House after a single term, Jimmy Carter is at ease with his presidential legacy.In his recent book White House Diary, Carter released excerpts from a journal he kept as president. In its afterword, he acknowledged it may be his last chance to comment on the work he and his team carried out, and he is proud of what we accomplished.This pride extends to what he described as a winning record with the U.S. Congress, according to his Sept. 20 interview with NBC anchor Brian Williams.And as you probably know, I had the highest batting average with Congress than any president in modern days except Lyndon Johnson, Carter said. Better than John Kennedy, better than anybody else. Despite the fact that we had some highly controversial things. So I had a very successful term.The Carter Center uses his success rating (batting average) from Congressional Quarterly, a leading authority on Congress. They calculate percentage of votes that go a president's way during his term. It's also based on a University of Virginia essay on his presidency.But wasn't Carter famously at odds with Congress? How could he possibly have been successful?We looked at Carter's White House Diary, where he elaborated more carefully on his track record in commentary accompanying Carter's April 19, 1977, entry:Despite the controversial and often unpopular nature of my proposals to the Congress, I had remarkably good success in congressional approval of bills I supported. The Congressional Quarterly reported that since 1953 Lyndon Johnson, John Kennedy and I ranked in that order in obtaining approval of legislation proposed to Congress. The Miller Center reported that my record exceeded Kennedy's.CQ Almanac publishes vote studies each year that determine how often the president took a clear position on a vote in Congress, and how often they went his way.The almanac lists success rates by term of Presidents Dwight D. Eisenhower through George W. Bush. If you average those rates for each president, Carter is third. He got his way 76.6 percent of the time. That's right behind Kennedy at 84.6 and Johnson at 82.2.That seems simple enough, but things get complicated from there.We also looked at the Miller Center of Public Affairs' website, which he cited for saying he was second only to Johnson. The book's afterword quoted the site directly:Carter gained a reputation for political ineptitude, even though his actual record in dealing with Congress belied that image. His success rate in getting presidential initiatives through Congress was much higher than that of Bush [...] Carter was also close to Johnson's success rates, and higher than Kennedy's record.The problem is that the website has since been revised since the book was published. Carter's CQ scores contradict it, so it was changed to avoid confusion, a Miller Center spokeswoman said.The Miller Center's assessment that Carter's congressional record is much better than it is perceived still stands, the spokeswoman emphasized.  We located no study that found Carter was second only to Johnson. Still, even if he's third behind Kennedy, who did not serve a full term, the change does not make that big of a difference, said Steven H. Hochman, director of research at the Carter Center.The difference was just Kennedy. Was he before or behind Kennedy? And it's not too much of a difference, Hochman said.Now for the tough part. There are many ways to assess a president's legislative success. Scholars think CQ's measure is helpful, but it does not take into account whether the president manages to turn his proposals into law. For instance, a tax package might pass the Senate but fail in the House. CQ would count the Senate vote as a success even though the overall effort failed.Furthermore, it may not be fair to compare the average of a two-term president with Carter's single term, one scholar noted. Second-term scores tend to be lower and drag a president's overall average down. If you compare first terms only, Carter drops to fourth behind Dwight D. Eisenhower. And if you look at how many of Carter's initiatives actually were enacted, his record is unexceptional. According to an analysis by Andrew Rudalevige, a political science professor at Dickinson College in Carlisle, Pa., who has studied presidential legislative successes, only 44 percent of his initiatives became law. This puts him behind Johnson, Bill Clinton, Eisenhower, George H.W. Bush and Kennedy, in that order. (Eisenhower and George H.W. Bush are tied.) Plus, if you compare Carter to other presidents who served while their parties controlled both the House and Senate, he's at or near the bottom, according to another analysis published in 1990. Still, Carter won nearly 70 percent of his contested and important votes, according to CQ numbers cited in Rudalevige's analysis. Other problems with the CQ score are that it doesn't measure whether a president's proposal was watered down, or take into account whether he worked under unusually hostile conditions.And Carter did push an ambitious agenda during a very difficult time, experts agreed. His proposals included reforms on health care, welfare and energy, topics that remain difficult today.Furthermore, the Democratic Party was deeply divided during Carter's administration. Reforms in the House of Representatives dispersed power more widely among its members, making it difficult to influence the body as a whole.Even Johnson, who is renowned for his legislative skill, would have struggled under those conditions, notes Mark A. Peterson, a professor at the University of California Los Angeles who has written extensively on presidential legislative successes.Yes, by one measure Carter did very well legislatively, but not quite as well as he has claimed, Peterson said. He didn't do well compared to other presidents whose parties had majorities in both houses of Congress, but considering his party's divisions, his achievements are notable, he added.And by another measure that really matters -- actually enacting legislation -- Carter fared quite poorly, with the recognition that he tried to push a bold, difficult agenda, Peterson said.Overall, though, experts we interviewed said Carter's legislative record exceeds its reputation.It's somewhat of a mixed case, but it is more successful than most people think, Rudalevige said.Consider his victory on the 1978 Panama Canal treaties, noted George C. Edwards III, a professor of political science at Texas A&M University who has written about Carter's legislative record. In 1976, almost half of the Senate pledged they would vote against altering the existing arrangement. Carter managed to get the two-thirds vote needed to change it in 1978.Now, what do we make of all this?We found no evidence that Carter's record surpassed every president since Eisenhower's but Johnson's, but according to one measure, he was close.A broader look at Carter's legislative record showed it was mixed. In at least one case, the Panama Canal treaties, his achievement was exceptional.Yet while his proposals garnered favorable votes in one chamber, many never became law. It's hard to call that a true record of legislative success.Still, he did better than most people think.AJC PolitiFact Georgia defines Half True as an accurate statement that leaves out important details or take things out of context.",0.7,0.6,0.9,0.7,0.2,0.5,0.4,0.8,0.6,half-true

Final Rating: Half True  ","Research found that over the course of the existence of the Brady Bill ban, the use of assault weapons in crimes decreased by two thirds.","Coming off his emotional congressional testimony backing legislation to renew a ban on military-style assault weapons, Milwaukee Police Chief Ed Flynn appeared on MSNBC.Asked about criticism alleging that the previous ban had almost no impact on the nations homicide rate, Flynn cited studies on the ban done for the U.S. Department of Justice.Researchers, said Flynn, found that over the course of the existence of the Brady Bill ban, the use of assault weapons in crimes decreased by two-thirds. He added: Now, they couldnt prove causation. Police implemented and embraced a wide variety of strategies and tactics during those 10 years as well. But its foolish not to see that there was a correlation. And to demand perfect social science causation proof before we can say that something had an impact on a phenomenon is foolish, its rhetorical and it doesnt relate to the reality of policing.As Congress debates tightening gun controls after the Newtown school massacre, we thought it was worth checking Flynns assertion about assault-weapon use during the ban that began in 1994 and expired in 2004.Did a study show a two-thirds drop off in use of assault weapons in crimes?The claim is in wide circulation, having found its way into talking points that U.S. Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-California) offers for the renewal of the assault weapons ban. The National Rifle Association, which is fighting the ban, disputes the number.At issue is a 2004 study, sponsored by the National Institute of Justice, an arm of the U.S. Justice Department. Its author, Christopher S. Koper, also did the federally sponsored report for Congress on the short term (1994-1996) effect of the ban.Koper is a veteran criminology researcher, formerly of the Police Executive Research Forum. At the time of the 2004 study he was a professor affiliated with the Jerry Lee Center of Criminology at the University of Pennsylvania. He is now at the Center for Evidence-Based Crime Policy at George Mason University.The 1994 ban was aimed at semiautomatics, including rifles and pistols, with features that appear useful in military and criminal applications but unnecessary in shooting sports or self-defense (examples include flash hiders, folding rifle stocks, and threaded barrels for attaching silencers), the study said.Flynn and Feinstein point to a conclusion in Kopers 2004 report that found a big decline in the percentage of assault weapons among the guns seized by law enforcement and sent to federal officials for tracing.That percentage dropped by 70 percent between 1992-03 and 2001-02. That is, the percentage went from 5.4 percent to 1.6 percent of guns seized, the study found. The percentages are low because the guns are rarely used in gun crimes.That 70 percent drop is the main evidence for the two-thirds claim.Theres another piece of data from Kopers study that suggests such a major decline. Its the experience in Boston pre-ban (1991 to 1993) and post-ban (2000 to 2002). There, police saw a 72 percent drop in assault weapons among all guns recovered by police.Lets take a closer look at both.The overriding point is that we found consistent evidence across multiple national and local data sources that the use of (assault weapons) declined substantially during the ban years, Koper said in an email to PolitiFact Wisconsin. The apparent drop was mainly in assault pistols, not assault rifles.In addition, Koper wrote, based on figures collected in six metro police department there were indications in the data that (assault weapons) were becoming increasingly rare over time.Koper, however, made clear that he did not try to come up with one definitive number that illustrated the decline in assault weapons seen in the data.A reading of the study shows why. It cautions in great detail that data that shows a 70 percent decline nationally is not conclusive.First, a large majority of guns recovered by police are not sent to federal authorities who trace the gun from its manufacture to sale. So those guns may not be representative of the types of firearms seized by police, the study noted.In addition, the drop may be attributable in large part to changes in tracing practices, the study noted.Still, Koper noted in the 2004 study that the dramatic decline started in the year of the ban.Ultimately, he concluded that the trace data suggest an actual decline in use of assault weapons in crimes.Koper told us the national tracing data may overstate the drop, but it's understandable that people cite that number since it's a national figure.He added: At any rate, there are lots of subtleties in this and no one right answer.The National Rifle Association critique of the Flynn-Feinstein claim is that traces are not synonymous with crimes.The study acknowledges that, but cites a variety of reasons why guns recovered by police should serve as a good approximation of the types of guns used in violent crime, even though many are not clearly linked to such crimes.When we asked Flynn about this, Police Inspector WilliamJessupwrote back saying: While there are limitations with any type of data, Chief Flynn does consider the 70 percent drop in ATF traces on assault weapons to be a reasonable proxy for the level of crime involving assault weapons during that period.Local findingsKoper told us that people who refer to a two-thirds drop might also be referring to the studys finding of a 72 percent reduction in assault weapon use in Boston based on police data about crime guns there.Other metro areas in the study also saw a decline, but only Bostons dropoff was in the two-thirds range.Milwaukee County was in the study. Data collected here -- just on guns used in homicides -- showed a 17 percent drop from 1995 to 1998 compared to before the ban.That was the smallest reduction among weapon trends studied in Baltimore, Boston, Miami-Dade, St. Louis, Milwaukee and Anchorage. The reductions generally were between 32 and 40 percent, the study said.The Koper study concluded by finding mixed success at reducing criminal use of banned guns -- as well as ammunition feeding devices known as large capacity magazines.The decline suggested by the national trace data and the experience in several cities was offset throughout at least the late 1990s by steady or rising use of other guns equipped with large capacity magazines, based on data studied in Baltimore, Milwaukee, Louisville, and Anchorage, the study found. There was an immense stock of exempted pre-ban magazines and it grew as more imports came in, it noted.Bottom line, the study said, was that because the ban has not yet reduced the use of (large capacity magazines) in crime, we cannot clearly credit the ban with any of the nations recent drop in gun violence. The bans exemption of millions of pre-ban weapons and magazines ensured gradual effects that are still unfolding and may not be fully felt for several years into the future, the study found.Our ratingIn a cable TV appearance, Flynn said researchers had found that over the course of the existence of the Brady Bill ban, the use of assault weapons in crimes decreased by two thirds.Flynn accurately quotes the 70 percent figure from an oft-cited study by a veteran researcher for the U.S. Department of Justice. The study makes no claim that the ban caused the apparent decline, but neither does Flynn.Flynns claim suffers somewhat, though, from an excess of certainty. The study and its author offer numerous and serious cautions that make clear the 70 percent figure -- while suggestive of a major drop -- is not a definitive figure. And the study makes clear that not all weapons traced by authorities are, as Flynns statement implied, used in crimes.Those are important details that were missing.",0.7,0.5,1.0,0.6,0.0,0.4,0.5,1.0,0.5,half-true

Final Rating: Half True  ","In 2018, the providers the state paid through the ACO reduced the amount of money spent on healthcare services by $7.7 million.","Clarification: This article has been revised from its original posting, after Gov. Phil Scotts office reached out with additional information clarifying his statement as focusing on the Medicaid patient pool. This made the statement more accurate — we changed the ruling from mostly false to half true — but Scott still left out important context about overall costs associated with the OneCare program. Gov. Phil Scott trumpeted the successes of Vermonts health care reform efforts in his budget address last month. There are compelling stories to be told, and accountable care is showing more potential than any other health care reform I can remember, he said of OneCare Vermont, the states accountable care organization. In 2018, the providers the state paid through the ACO reduced the amount of money spent on healthcare services by $7.7 million, Scott said. That savings figure jumped out at us. Our research on OneCare has found mixed results — and an open admission from health care officials that the program has not yet created the savings they hope to achieve. Did we miss something? We asked Scotts office for evidence and were referred to Ena Backus, director of health care reform for the state. She cited a Department of Vermont Health Access report on 2018 results for Medicaid patients. The $7.7 million in savings came from a small portion of Vermonts nearly 200,000 Medicaid patients. About 42,000 of those Vermonters participate in OneCare, said Alicia Cooper, director of payment reform for the department. An even smaller portion of those patients see doctors who are paid a set fee each month, rather than payments for each procedure. And its that subset of patients — those participating in OneCare whose doctors are paid a monthly fee — who cost the state $7.7 million less to care for than was originally expected, according to Backus. That point that was made [by Scott] demonstrates that there was a change in provider behavior that we can measure, Backus said. Ethan Latour, a spokesperson for Scott, further clarified this point in an email to VTDigger. Those words, STATE and THROUGH THE ACO, explicitly describe the population, he wrote. The problem? Scott referred in his speech to the amount of money spent on health care services. First off, his statement implies that there were savings in the entire health care system — not just a small piece of it. Secondly, the $7.7 million wasn't returned to taxpayers. Under the new model, OneCare Vermont and hospitals keep the savings, as a reward for keeping patients healthy. OneCare actually spent more money than expected —about $1.5 million —on all medical care for state Medicaid patients in 2018, if you factor in the doctors who charged traditional fee per procedure rates. Scott also didnt mention that Vermont taxpayers paid OneCare $11.7 million for administrative costs that year. OneCare collects money from Medicaid, Medicare and commercial insurance and then distributes it as a flat monthly payment for patient care. The administrative costs and incentives paid by the state cannot be entirely divorced from savings created by the program. In addition, the governor cited savings in the Medicaid program but across the OneCare there were no net decreases in spending after administrative costs and incentives for providers. Scotts assessment led him to urge the Legislature to grant OneCare $5.7 million in additional Medicaid monies during the state budget adjustment process -- on the condition the accountable care organization applies for nonprofit status or meets equivalent transparency standards. The real problem, Scott said, is OneCares ineffective public relations effort. In his budget speech, the governor invoked the states head regulator, Green Mountain Care Board chair Kevin Mullin, who in November urged the organization to tell a better story. I understand the ACO hasnt done a great job explaining how theyre improving peoples health and reducing costs, Scott said. But there are compelling stories to be told. Cooper, from the Department of Vermont Health Access, said Scotts $7.7 million assertion may be one of those stories. At Medicaid, were encouraged by these early results, she said. Thats enough to warrant continued testing of the model. Scott said, in 2018, the providers the state paid through the ACO reduced the amount of money spent on healthcare services by $7.7 million. That statement is partially accurate, but it does not account for the administrative costs or financial incentives paid by the state. Politifacts guidance describes half true as: The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context. Scotts claim ignores important facts about the cost of OneCare that would lead his audience to draw a different conclusion about the program's financial performance — even for the specific patient population that he references in his statement. ​",0.5,0.5,1.0,0.5,0.0,0.5,0.5,1.0,0.5,half-true

Final Rating: Half True  ",Says President Obama waited two weeks to call the attack in Libya terror.,"For weeks, Republicans have been hammering the Obama administration for allegedly concealing the true nature of the attack in Libya that claimed the life of the U.S. ambassador and three other Americans. During the second presidential debate, Mitt Romney charged that it took the president 14 days before he called the attack in Benghazi an act of terror.Obama had bristled at the idea that his administration had played politics with the attack. He called the suggestion offensive. Obama: The day after the attack, governor, I stood in the Rose Garden and I told the American people in the world that we are going to find out exactly what happened -- that this was an act of terror -- and I also said that we're going to hunt down those who committed this crime.Romney: I think interesting the president just said something, which is that on the day after the attack he went into the Rose Garden and said that this was an act of terror.Obama: That's what I said.Romney: You said in the Rose Garden the day after the attack, it was an act of terror. It was not a spontaneous demonstration, is that what you're saying?Obama: Please proceed, governor.Romney: I want to make sure we get that for the record because it took the president 14 days before he called the attack in Benghazi an act of terror.Obama: Get the transcript.We went to the transcript, and the president has a point. On September 12, the day after the attack, in the Rose Garden, Obama condemned the attack and said, No acts of terror will ever shake the resolve of this great nation. In the days since, some have parsed Obama's remarks and argued he didn't say the Benghazi attack was specifically an act of terror. However, given the overall context of his comments, it seems a fair conclusion that he was including the attack in the acts of terror that he said would never shake American resolve.However, in the days that followed, the White House spokesman and the U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations suggested that the attack seemed to have taken advantage of a demonstration over an American-made video that disparaged Islam.On Sept. 13, White House spokesman Jay Carney said, The protests we're seeing around the region are in reaction to this movie. They are not directly in reaction to any policy of the United States or the government of the United States or the people of the United States.The next day, a State Department spokeswoman said, We are very cautious about drawing any conclusions with regard to who the perpetrators were, what their motivations were, whether it was premeditated. But she ended with this: Obviously, there are plenty of people around the region citing this disgusting video as something that has been motivating.On Sept. 16, five days after the attack, Susan Rice, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations said, We do not have information at present that leads us to conclude that this was premeditated or preplanned.On Sept. 20, Carney told reporters, It is, I think, self-evident that what happened in Benghazi was a terrorist attack. Our embassy was attacked violently, and the result was four deaths of American officials.But that same day, Obama told an audience at a town hall meeting, What we do know is that the natural protests that arose because of the outrage over the video were used as an excuse by extremists to see if they can also directly harm U.S. interests.It wasnt until Sept. 21 that everyone in the administration as a whole stated publicly that the attack was planned and executed by a terrorist group.Our rulingRomney said it took the president 14 days before he called the Libya attack terror.In fact, Obama described it in those terms the day after the attack. But in the days that followed, neither he nor all the members of his administration spoke consistently on the subject. There were many suggestions that the attack was part of demonstrations over an American-made video that disparaged Islam. Update: After we published this item, we heard from readers that the president called the attack an act of terror two more times -- on Sept. 13 in Colorado and Sept. 14 in Nevada.As for the ones we lost last night: I want to assure you, we will bring their killers to justice, Obama said at a campaign event in Nevada. And we want to send a message all around the world -- anybody who would do us harm: No act of terror will dim the light of the values that we proudly shine on the rest of the world, and no act of violence will shake the resolve of the United States of America.So as we noted in our original item, Romney is off the mark as it relates to the word terror. But Obama contributed to the administration's mixed message when he spoke at the Univision Town Hall event on Sept. 20. A questioner asked: We have reports that the White House said today that the attacks in Libya were a terrorist attack. Do you have information indicating that it was Iran, or al Qaeda was behind organizing the protests?Here is Obamas reply:Well, were still doing an investigation, and there are going to be different circumstances in different countries. And so I dont want to speak to something until we have all the information. What we do know is that the natural protests that arose because of the outrage over the video were used as an excuse by extremists to see if they can also directly harm U.S. interests.So although Obama acknowledged the uncertainty, he emphasized the inflammatory video and the protest as contributing factors in the attack.By mentioning the video, Obama drew attention away from the possibility that the attack had been a planned assault. This lies at the heart of the dispute over what Obama and his administration were saying in the days after the attack. The president had the chance to be more complete and direct in Florida, but the administration was continuing to focus on the response to the video.Just four days earlier, Ambassador Rice downplayed the possibility that the attack was premeditated. The presidents words did not correct that impression.So while Obama did use the word terror, there is also some truth to Romney's point that it took many days for the administration to fully characterize the attack as the work of a terrorist group. So we're still rating this Half True.",0.5,0.5,1.0,0.5,0.0,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,half-true

Final Rating: Half True  ",SaysStacey Evans voted for (school) vouchers...in the beginning.,"As public school advocates, Georgia Democratic gubernatorial frontrunners Stacey Abrams and Stacey Evans haveboth taken a firm stance against privatized public education and especially school vouchers. But at a recent forum featuring the two candidates, Abrams accused Evans of voting for vouchers when she was a state representative. You voted for vouchers. You didnt vote for it the last two times, but you voted for it in the beginning, Abrams said on Oct. 2. Abrams later said she was referring to Evans involvement with a bill about the Georgia Student Scholarship Organization. The program began in 2008, three years before Evans held a seat in Georgias General Assembly. Back then, the Student Scholarship Organization bill established a program that allows independent individuals and businesses to receive tax credits if they make donations to local private schools. The money is then used to fund scholarships that are given to qualified, low-income students to attend the private institutions. Abrams claims that Evans had voted in favor of school vouchers a few years later, when the Legislature made revisions to the program. Evans did vote for an early version of the 2011 bill, but not for the final version. According to her campaign, she only voted for the measure because it had provisions that improved the programs transparency. When the final bill hit the House floor with its final revisions, the transparency clauses were removed, so Evans voted against the bill. Evans has also maintained that she has never voted for vouchers because the Student Scholarship Organization is not a voucher program. On June 26, 2017, theGeorgia Supreme Court ruledthat stated that the scholarship program is not a voucher program, because it is financed by private individuals, not public revenue, a fact that Abrams had acknowledged during the debate. Despite the Supreme Court ruling, the Student Scholarship Organizations status as a voucher program is still subject to debate. Before the forum, the Evans campaign had already been defending her stance against vouchers, and on Oct. 12 the Abrams campaign shared its opinion on Facebookthat the funds in the program are vouchers by another name. Our ruling Abrams said Evans voted for (school) vouchers...in the beginning. Abrams said she was referring to the Student Scholarship Organization program. Some aspects of Abrams statement are wrong. Evans wasnt in the legislature in 2008 when program was approved. In 2011, Evans voted for revisions to the program, although she voted against the final version after those revisions were dropped. Over the years, theres been a legal dispute over whether the tax credits that fund the Student Scholarship Organization make the program different from school vouchers. In June 2017 Georgias Supreme Court ruled that the voucher label did not apply. Abrams'claim had some accurate points, but it left out important details.",0.4,0.6,0.8,0.5,0.2,0.5,0.4,0.5,0.4,half-true

Final Rating: Half True","For immigrants with visa overstays, we make no effort to hold them accountable to that or uphold the law.","Republican vice presidential nominee Mike Pence says that in addition to deporting undocumented criminals and strengthening the border, the United States should be tougher about removing people who overstay their visas. An enormous number of people come to this country legally and then simply overstay their visas because we make no effort to hold them accountable to that or uphold the law, Pence said Sept. 4 on NBCs Meet the Press. People who have overstayed their visas account for a large portion of the estimated 11 million people in the country illegally, about 40 percent by some estimates. Are government officials really making no efforts against people who overstay their visas, or to uphold the law? Pences team guided us to a June Washington Times article that says immigration officials catch an abysmally small percentage of the illegal immigrants who arrived on visas but overstayed their welcome. The article attributes that factoid to an admission of immigration authorities. But there is more to the story. Enforcement priorities U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement does go after visa violators, but the agency prioritizes violent undocumented immigrants. The agencys top focusis the removal of people convicted of violent crimes, such as murder and rape, ICE spokesperson Dani Bennett said via email. People who overstay their visas but dont pose a threat to national security, public safety or border security fall into ICEs second priority. The conservative-leaning Washington Times reported that at least 480,000 people didnt leave the country as expected in fiscal year 2015. Immigration officials investigated just 10,000 of these cases and arrested fewer than 2,000 because, as the Times reported, the others dont rise to the level of being priority targets. The article was based on a June 2016 House Homeland Security Committee hearing on overstays. Homeland Security Department officials testified that out of the nearly 10,000 leads pursued: about 4,100 cases were closed for being in compliance; at least 3,000 were under current investigation; 1,910 were arrested, and the rest were under continuous monitoring and further investigation as appropriate. ICE data shows that out of a total 235,413 removals in fiscal year 2015, about 18,500 were second-priority removals. Theres no breakdown of how many of those were visa overstays (that category also includes those convicted of drug-related crimes, unlawful possession or use of firearm and other misdemeanors). Indefinite number of overstays Immigration officials and scholars say not much is known about legal immigrants who overstay their visa, so they rely on estimates. In 2006, Pew Research Center said visa overstays could make up at least 4 millionof the population here illegally, roughly one-third of thatpopulation. The first legal requirement for an entry-exit system came in the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996, according to the Bipartisan Policy Center. It took about 20 years before DHS released its first ever Entry/Exit Overstay Report, though it only contained information for fiscal year 2015. Almost 45 million people were expected to leave in fiscal year 2015, the report said, and about 98.8 percent did so on time. About 482,700 were still in the country by Sept. 30, 2015, the end of the 2015 fiscal year. That dropped to 416,500 by Jan. 4, 2016. Overstay consequences While DHS devotes less enforcement resources to visa overstays than it does to border enforcement, violators are still apprehended and removed, said Donald M. Kerwin, executive director of the Center for Migration Studies, a think tank studying international migration. Undocumented immigrants also are not eligible for most public benefits, said Robert Warren, an expert on immigration and senior visiting fellow at the center. People who overstay their visas and become undocumented may also face limitations when applying for jobs. The Immigration Reform and Control Act in 1986 forbids employers from knowingly hiring people who are not authorized to work in the United States. If they leave and want to come back, they may be disqualified from getting a visa and not be let in, said Lazaro Zamora, a Bipartisan Policy Center senior policy analyst. Under the Immigration and Nationality Act, unlawful presence for more than 180 days is punishable by a 3-year bar against re-entering, and unlawful presence of one year or more is punishable by a 10-year ban, Zamora said. Our ruling Pence said, An enormous number of people come to this country legally and then simply overstay their visas because we make no effort to hold them accountable to that or uphold the law. Pences statement suggests there are no repercussions for people who overstay their visa. While they are not ICEs top concern — officials say they prioritize the removal of convicted criminals over visa violators— they can still be deported and barred from coming back into the United States. About 8 percent of the 235,413 people removed from the country in fiscal year 2015 belonged toa category thatincludes visa overstays.",0.5,0.5,1.0,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,half-true

Final Rating: Half True  ","Says the federal stimulus program was ineffective because the number of jobs has actually decreased by 18,300 through July 2011.","Like most Republicans, Rep. Greg Walden says the $825 billion stimulus law has been a failure.But unlike other critics who speak in contemptuous generalities, Walden puts hard numbers behind his opinion.When the bill was signed into law, the White House promised that the stimulus would increase by 44,000 the number of jobs in Oregon by December 2010, he says on his official congressional website. Unfortunately, even with the stimulus, since the bill was signed, the number of jobs has actually decreased by 18,300 through July 2011.Walden supports his claim with a study by the Republican staff of the House Ways and Means Committee. That study relies on federal statistics and, sure enough, both the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics and the Oregon Employment Department show that Oregon had fewer people working in July 2010 than February 2009.When the stimulus was signed into law in February 2009, 1.643 million people in Oregon held non-farm jobs, according to the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics. In July 2010, after billions of dollars of stimulus spending had been dispersed, the number of non-farm jobs in Oregon was 1.625 million.Thats a loss of 18,000 jobs which is the number Walden cited.But its only part of the story.First, a quick recap. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, which is the full name of what is commonly called the stimulus, became law in February 2009. Democrats pushed the legislation as a way to create jobs and extend unemployment benefits through a mix of government spending, tax cuts and financial aid to cash-strapped states.The stimulus and its performance have provided a high intensity battlefield ever since. The White House released at least six reports on the program, counting jobs that were created or saved as a result of the stimulus. Those counts were augmented by dozens of other reports from independent sources.The most recent came Nov. 22 from the Congressional Budget Office. It says the stimulus is responsible for adding between 500,000 and 3.3 million jobs nationally.But the CBO, which is nonpartisan, also says its reports, do not provide a comprehensive estimate of the laws impact on U.S. employment, which could be higher or lower...Among the reasons is that some of the jobs included in the reports might have existed even without the stimulus, and that the reports do not attempt to measure the number of indirect jobs.Earlier studies, both independent and partisan, have offered similar ranges for the laws impact on jobs. A March study by the White House Council of Economic Advisers explains why.Evaluating the impact, said the report, which was the sixth in a series,   is inherently difficult because we do not observe what would have happened to the economy in the absence of policy.Separately, the councils report cited four independent analyses by the CBO and three private economic analysis companies that all found between 1.3 million and 3.6 million jobs saved or created.Oregons acting state economist Mark McMullen agrees precision is difficult -- and fraught with politics.This issue is about as politically charged as topics in economics get, he said.He points to CBO numbers to explain how many stimulus jobs were created and reported in Oregon. In 2009, 18,412 direct jobs were created with 33,489 in 2010 and 17,663 in 2011.Even trickier is estimating the indirect jobs from the stimulus. Here, McMullen and other economists extend estimates that Oregon collected between 1.2 percent and 1.5 percent of stimulus jobs depending on the year. That translates to 2,967 to 13,350 indirect jobs in 2009; 8,714 to 41,078 jobs in 2010 and 5,820 to 30,473 jobs in 2011.Economists say theres another conundrum: Because of constant churning in the economy, the stimulus law could have generated - or come close to generating - the number of jobs the White House predicted even though total employment in the state declined. The reason is that the jobs total is fluid and that additions in jobs like road construction could be eclipsed by losses in other parts of the economy that arent touched by the stimulus.There are also jobs protected with stimulus money. Teachers, prison guards, and other state workers who probably would have been laid off were able to keep their jobs because the stimulus sent $2.4 billion to Oregon. More than $1.2 billion was used to fill state cuts to education that could have triggered teacher layoffs in every district. Another $117 million went to public safety, with some of that money used to avoid cut-backs in police and emergency response personnel.The White House and supporters factor those saved jobs into their calculations. Walden and critics do not.Got it?Its all very murky and far from precise. But this much is certain: As of July 31, 2011, there were 18,300 fewer people working in Oregon than in February 2009. That is the number Walden cites in his comment and that much is true.But Waldens context suggests that the stimulus did not produce jobs for Oregon, and that is not correct. While economists and other experts say its impossible to say how many Oregon jobs were created or saved, as the White House puts it, there certainly were some. And its clear that a significant number of Oregon jobs would have been lost without the stimulus.Waldens assertion of lost jobs uses numbers out of context and leaves out important details.

Final Rating: Half True  ","Says the term illegal alien is a legal term, its in statute, its a federal term.","An exchange between alegislator and the leader of Texas state law enforcement agency made us wonder whether federal law uses illegal alien to describe any individual living in the U.S. without legal authorization. It doesnt, we learned, though the term makes a few appearances. Many news organizations avoid the IA term. In 2013, the Associated Press dropped illegal immigrant from its stylebook. AP spokesman Paul Colford said then that illegal should be used to describe actions, not people, and the AP counseled journalists against using illegal alien except in direct quotations. We recognize, though, that illegal alien persists. The term showed up 80 times in our May 2018 Google search of the PolitiFact website withillegal aliens popping up 5,620 times. Lets unpack what touched off this fact-check, then turn toillegal alien in American law. West Texaslegislator questions director At an April 18, 2018, Texas House hearing, state Rep. Mary González, D-San Elizario, elicited agreement from Steve McCraw, director of the Texas Department of Public Safety, that the words that we choose to use are powerful. González then told McCraw she had concerns about the language that you use and the agency is using in talking about undocumented immigrants. If were talking about children, for example, unaccompanied minors, then using words like illegal aliens, I have had a concern about that, right? she said. And so but then, in your testimony you used it again. And so Im guessing, my question is, is the agency standard in typically referring to undocumented immigrants as IAs? McCraw answered: I always use illegal aliens and I have when I was assigned to the Department of Justice, when I worked at the FBI, when I was assigned as the director of the foreign terrorism task force because its a term, its a legal term, its in statute, its a federal term--and its not intended to degrade anybody in any way, shape or form. McCraw spent 21 years with the FBI before becoming director of Texas DPS, the state law-enforcement agency known for its state troopers and Texas Rangers. González replied that people in my community would find it very concerning to use this language. McCraw answered that hed consult DPS staff and re-evaluate the use of words that their director has been using to describe, Ive been consistent about that. And it its insulting, if it truly is insulting, I dont intend to insult anybody. We later asked the DPS to elaborate on McCraws claim that illegal aliens appears in statute. We didnt hear back. Checking for illegal alien in federal law Given McCraw's singling out of federal statutes, we launched our post-testimonylook by searchingthe portion of federal law titled Aliens and Nationality, and saw that the chapter titled Immigration and Nationality defines the word alien alone as any person not a citizen or national of the United States. But in the same Definitions section, we spotted illegal just once--and not in the context suggested by the DPS directors testimony. Illegal appears in a section stating that an alien lawfully given permanent residency shall not be regarded as seeking U.S. entry in connection with the countrys immigration laws unless the alien has, among possibilities, engaged in illegal activity after having departed the United States. Another portion of the law says the U.S. attorney general shall have the power and duty to control and guard the boundaries and borders of the United States against the illegal entry of aliens. Our scrolling of the act also picked up a mention of illegal entrants. Federal agency offers examples We separately heard back from Arwen FitzGerald of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. By email, FitzGerald pointed to four uses of illegal alien, two in federal law and the others in a congressional act. Section 1252(c) of the Aliens and Nationality laws is titled: Authorizing State and local law enforcement officials to arrest and detain certain illegal aliens. The section authorizes state and local law enforcement officials to arrest and detain an individual who— (1) is an alien illegally present in the United States; and (2) has previously been convicted of a felony in the United States and deported or left the United States after such conviction. Section 1365, titled Reimbursement of States for costs of incarcerating illegal aliens and certain Cuban nationals, applies to any alien convicted of a felony whos in the country unlawfully and whose most recent entry was without inspection, or whose most recent admission to the United States was as a nonimmigrant and whose period of authorized stay as a nonimmigrant expired, or whose unlawful status was known to the government. FitzGerald also pointed out that a section of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 authorized the hiring of 25 new federal lawyers to prosecute persons who bring into the United States or harbor illegal aliens or violate other criminal statutes involving illegal aliens. Also noted: A section of the act requiring an annual report detailing the number of illegal aliens sentenced or jailed for felonies in state and federal prisons. That act, we saw, relies on the established definition of alien spotted earlier. It doesnt explicitly define illegal alien, though by our count, the term appears nine times including in a section titled Demonstration project for identification of illegal aliens in incarceration facility of Anaheim, California and a section titled Pilot programs on limiting issuance of drivers licenses to illegal aliens. Experts: Mentions dont mean much By email, though, academic experts on immigration law told us such scattered mentions of illegal alien in legislation and law dont mean much. Denise Gilman, who directs the University of Texas immigration law clinic, pointed out that all but one of the terms mentions in the 1996 act appear in section titles, not intended statutory language. The title is a political marker in the legislation but is not the law itself, Gilman wrote. For example, the section titled PILOT PROGRAMS ON LIMITING ISSUANCE OF DRIVER'S LICENSES TO ILLEGAL ALIENS, goes on to use legal terms in the actual text, Gilman wrote, which refers only to aliens who are not lawfully present in the United States. Notably, Rick Su of the University of Buffalo School of Law told us, the IA term doesnt appear in the vast Immigration and Nationality Act, the nations main immigration law. Su acknowledged that the term appears in the 1996 acts section about the federal government reimbursing states for incarcerating certain immigrants. But that section, Su said, defines an illegal alien solely in the context of the section -- as any alien convicted of a felony who is in the United States unlawfully and -- (1) whose most recent entry into the United States was without inspection, or (2) whose most recent admission to the United States was as a nonimmigrant and -- (A) whose period of authorized stay as a nonimmigrant expired, or (B) whose unlawful status was known to the Government, before the date of the commission of the crime for which the alien is convicted. In contrast, Su told us, illegal alien has been commonly used to refer to immigrants simply present in the U.S. without a valid visa or legal status, or whose legal status expired or is terminated. More prevalent terms in federal law, Su said, include inadmissible aliens or unauthorized aliens. Su wrote that inadmissible aliens and deportable aliens are different individuals under the INA, and have specific criteria, he said, with inadmissible aliens probably closest to how the term illegal aliens is commonly used (federal law treats those who enter without inspection to be construed as not having been admitted), Su wrote. All this said, Su said, other government documents--including memos, directives and reports--useillegal alien. The Supreme Court also has used the term, Su said. He singled out the courts rulings in De Canas v. Bica, a case decided in 1976 about California governing the hiring of illegal aliens. Su also noted Arizona v. U.S. in which the court in 2012 upheld parts of Arizonas 2010 immigration law. That opinion employs illegal alien twice in quoting others and twice in speculation about how Arizona might enforce its law. To our inquiry about McCraws claim, Jeff Baker of the Pepperdine School of Law summed up: The term alien is common in the United States Code and in U.S. law, although the term illegal alien is very rare in the statutes. In the Code, alien typically means someone who is not a citizen, and, despite the current political uses and preferences (including my own), this is fairly common. I do not know when alien entered the law with this usage, Baker wrote, but he noted that President John Adams signed the very controversial Alien and Sedition Acts in 1798. Baker went on: That was not the Illegal Alien and Sedition Acts, however. Personally, Baker told us, he favors other language in our national discourse. Alien may be a technical term of art, but illegal alien is almost always pejorative in contemporary usage. State laws Finally, wesearched Texaslaws and the state constitution on the Texas Legislatures website and didnt find illegal alien or illegal aliens though we saw multiple provisions specifying how laws apply to aliens. Our ruling McCraw told legislators the term illegal alien is a legal term, its in statute, its a federal term. The term appears--yet scarcely--in federal law. Best we can tell, though, nolaw defines the term as referring to all individuals living in the U.S. without legal authorization. Where the term does appear,its undefined or part of an introductory title or limited to apply to certain individuals convicted of felonies.

Final Rating: Half True  ","If you're one of the more than 250 million Americans who already have health insurance, you will keep your health insurance.","After the Supreme Court upheld the health care bill hed signed into law, President Barack Obama applauded the decision in a speech at the White House. In that speech, Obama responded to critics, including Mitt Romney, who say the law could force many Americans off their health care plans.If you're one of the more than 250 million Americans who already have health insurance, you will keep your health insurance, Obama said. This law will only make it more secure and more affordable.This is a variation on a line Obama has used before, and which we have rated in the past.For instance, at a town hall meeting in New Hampshire on Aug. 11, 2009, Obama said, If you like your health care plan, you can keep your health care plan. Later, Obama spoke more specifically.In a speech to a joint session of Congress in September 2009, Obama said, If you are among the hundreds of millions of Americans who already have health insurance through your job, or Medicare, or Medicaid, or the VA, nothing in this plan will require you or your employer to change the coverage or the doctor you have. We concluded that nothing in Obamas proposal proactively forced such changes, and the bills clearly intended to leave much of the current health care system in place. The claim Obama made after the Supreme Court decision on June 28, 2012, was a broader statement, and as a result, its less accurate.First, a March 2012 study by the Congressional Budget Office, the nonpartisan number-crunching arm of Congress, projected that 3 million to 5 million fewer non-elderly people would obtain coverage through their employer each year from 2019 through 2022 than would have been the case before the law was passed. Including those with individually purchased policies enlarges that decline by an additional 1 million to 3 million Americans.CBOs estimate is broadly in line with a number of other independent estimates. A study by the Urban Institute projected a decline of about 500,000 people. The Lewin Group predicted a decline of about 3 million people. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services actuary pegged the number at about 1 million fewer people. And the RAND Corp. projected that about 4 million more individuals would be covered by employment-based coverage by 2016.Why are these changes occurring? Some will be made voluntarily by Americans seeking better health care options outside of their employers plan, but we think its reasonable for Obama to ignore these changes in his calculation.Other switches will be involuntary. As we have previously noted, many Americans already lose their current health plan for reasons that have nothing to do with the new law. Your employer may change insurance carriers, for instance, or your insurance carrier may unilaterally modify the terms of your plan.How common is this? The Medical Expenditure Panel Survey, sponsored by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, found that in 2007, just over 14 percent of the entire U.S. population switched health insurance. However, this underestimates the rate of switching, because the study included people of all ages (including those covered by Medicare, who rarely switch) and because it doesnt count a switch from one plan to the other within the same insurance company.The latter scenario is common. Mercer, a private consulting firm, found that in each of the years from 2005 to 2008, roughly a quarter of companies said they made changes to their plans that would result in employees paying a greater share of the cost. In 2009 and 2010, it rose to one-third.The number becomes substantial if you add up the workers who lose coverage entirely; who change jobs (voluntarily or involuntarily); who work for companies that change insurance carriers or adjust plan terms significantly; or whose employers insurance carrier is merged or bought out. And knowing that many workers every year are already required to change plans provides a different impression than what Obama is suggesting.Our rulingObama has a reasonable point: His health care law does take pains to allow Americans to keep their health plan if they want to remain on it.But Obama suggests that keeping the insurance you like is guaranteed. In reality, Americans are not simply able to keep their insurance through thick and thin. Even before the law has taken effect, the rate of forced plan-switching among policyholders every year is substantial, and the CBO figures suggest that the law could increase that rate, at least modestly, even if Americans on balance benefit from the laws provisions.",0.5,0.6,1.0,0.5,0.4,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,half-true

Final Rating: Half True  ",Most people in my home state of Texas disagree with the president building a wall across our border.,"Democratic Congressman Joaquin Castro said at a news conference on Monday that most people in Texas are opposed to constructing a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border. Our country, since its founding, has become the most prosperous and powerful nation on earth without any wall, said Castro, who represents San Antonio. Thats why I believe most of the American people and most people in my home state of Texas disagree with the president building a wall across our border. Castro offered this claim about Texans while discussing legislation he sponsored, approved by the House on Tuesday, that would block President Donald Trumps emergency order aimed at securing funding for his border wall. Its no surprise that the Democratic-controlled House opposes Trumps plan to build a wall, but is Castro right? Do Texans also oppose a wall? Polls show Texans divided on the wall Castro spokeswoman Jamie Geller said the congressmans claim was based on an April 2018 poll published by Quinnipiac University which reported that 53 percent of respondents surveyed opposed construction of a wall, with a margin of error of plus or minus 3.6 percentage points. We decided to take a step back and consider polls released on this subject since 2016 from three non-partisan entities that run surveys in Texas to assess the validity of Castros claim: University of Texas/Texas Tribune polls, Texas Lyceum polls and Quinnipiac University polls. Four polls showed more respondents opposing the wall than supporting it, with one poll showing the opposite. A sixth survey released Tuesday, after Castro made his claim on Texans opposing the wall, revealed an even split. Only two of the polls showed a clear majority in opposition to the wall. A University of Texas/Texas Tribune poll of registered voters in Texas published in June 2016 showed that 52 percent of respondents either strongly supported or somewhat supported a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border. The same poll, which had a margin of error of plus or minus 2.83 percentage points, found 40 percent of respondents said they either strongly opposed or somewhat opposed a border wall. Of those polled, 8 percent said they did not know or had no opinion on the wall. Two years later, in February 2018, a University of Texas/Texas Tribune poll showed that 50 percent of respondents said they either strongly opposed or somewhat opposed a border wall and 45 percent strongly supported or somewhat supported a wall. Two polls from Texas Lyceum, a non-profit organization, showed majorities opposing the wall. These polls did not limit the pool of respondents to likely or registered voters and instead surveyed adults in Texas. A September 2016 poll from the group showed that 59 percent of adults polled opposed Trumps proposed border wall, with 35 percent supporting the wall. The poll had a margin of error of plus or minus 3.1 percentage points. An April 2017 Texas Lyceum poll, which had a margin of error of plus or minus 3.1 percentage points, reported 61 percent of respondents opposing the wall and 35 percent expressing support. One year later, in April 2018, Quinnipiac University released a poll of Texas voters that showed 53 percent of respondents opposed building a wall along the border and 43 percent supported it. The poll surveyed 1,029 voters and the margin of error of 3.6 percentage points raised the possibility that fewer than 50 percent of Texas voters actually opposed the wall. Geller, Castros spokeswoman, pointed to this April 2018 poll as the evidence behind the Democrats claim. On Tuesday, Quinnipiac University released a new poll that shows Texas voters are evenly split on whether they support a border wall. Of the 1,222 voters surveyed, 48 percent said they supported a wall and 48 percent said they opposed one. The poll had a margin of error of plus or minus 3.4 percentage points. Peter Brown, assistant director of the Quinnipiac University Poll, said the results show that Castros claim is not entirely true, at least as of Tuesday afternoon. Its factually wrong, he said. Its 48-48. But do Texas voters support the way Trump is pursuing construction of the wall? The same Quinnipiac University Poll showed that 60 percent of respondents said they disapproved of Trumps move to use emergency powers to secure the funding needed to construct a wall. Our ruling Castro said most people in my home state of Texas disagree with the president building a wall across our border. Polls from the University of Texas/Texas Tribune, Texas Lyceum and Quinnipiac University showed that Texas voters and adults are largely divided on their support for a wall. Only two of the polls showed a clear majority in opposition to the wall – those conducted by Texas Lyceum in 2016 and 2017. In these two polls, the survey questioned adults in Texas and was not limited to likely or registered voters, unlike theUniversity of Texas/Texas Tribune and Quinnipiac University polls. Castros comment was not limited to registered or likely voters, so we kept that in mind while determining a ruling. Recent polls show more Texans opposing a border wall than supporting it, but only two of the six polls we considered showed a clear majority.

Final Rating: Half True  ",Under the Obama economy ... utility bills are higher.,"In his acceptance speech at the Republican National Convention in Tampa, Mitt Romney sought to show how the economy has stumbled under President Barack Obama.In the richest country in the history of the world, this Obama economy has crushed the middle class, he said. Family income has fallen by $4,000, but health insurance premiums are higher, food prices are higher, utility bills are higher, and gasoline prices have doubled.In this item, well look at one of those claims -- that under the Obama economy ... utility bills are higher.When we contacted the Romney campaign, a spokesman said Romney was referring to electricity prices. But in his speech he said utilities, so we'll also examine other types, too.We found data for electricity, natural gas, home heating oil, propane, telephone services, and combined data for water, sewer and trash services. We looked specifically at prices for residential customers rather than commercial or other sectors. We also attempted, where possible, to compare the same months in 2009 and 2012, in order to eliminate any impact from cyclical or seasonal variations. Well take each type of utility in turn.ElectricityThe Energy Information Administration, the federal agency that tracks energy statistics, offers data on average retail prices for electricity residential customers in cents per kilowatt hour.In 2009, Obamas first year, it was 11.51 cents, then rose in 2010 to 11.55 cents and again in 2011 to 11.80 cents. Through the first six months of 2012, it fell slightly to 11.79 cents.So overall, electricity is up by about 2.4 percent over the three-and-a-half year period, or less than 1 percent a year. On this score, Romney is correct.Natural gasObama does better if you look at natural gas. The agency has data for the first five months of 2012, as well as monthly data stretching back for years before that. Specifically, the agency measures dollars per thousand cubic feet for residential customers.When you compare each of the five months in 2009 to its equivalent month in 2012, prices have dropped in every case.For instance, in January 2009, natural gas was $12.49; by January 2012, it was $9.55. And in May 2009, natural gas was $12.86, a price that by May 2012 had dropped to $12.19.So for natural gas, prices have consistently fallen under Obama, often by larger percentages than the rise in electricity.Home heating oilData from the same agency shows that home heating oil was $2.42 per gallon during the week of Jan. 19, 2009, but rose to $3.94 by the week of Jan. 23, 2012. Thats a 62 percent increase over three years, or roughly 20 percent per year -- a big spike.Residential propaneAgency data shows an increase for residential propane prices. For the week of Jan. 19, 2009, residential propane was $2.31 a gallon, a price that rose by the week of Jan. 23, 2012, to $2.86 a gallon. Thats a 24 percent increase, or about 8 percent a year.Water, sewer and trash collectionThe Consumer Price Index -- the governments primary measurement of inflation -- calculates a combined measurement for water, sewer and trash collection. Its an index, meaning that the raw numbers we report below dont correspond to specific dollar amounts per unit but rather provide a way to compare the movements of prices over a given period of time.In July 2009, the index stood at 161.4. By July 2012, it rose to 189.8. Thats an increase of 18 percent, or 6 percent a year.Telephone servicesThe Consumer Price Index also studies telephone prices. In July 2009, the index stood at 102.6 and fell by July 2012 to 101.6. Thats a decrease, though by less than 1 percent per year.Are the increases unique to Obama?Over time, utility prices consistently go up, according to George Washington University economist Tara Sinclair. In fact, rising prices are more the rule than the exception.For example, we looked at how prices for each of these utilities moved during a three-year period of George W. Bush's presidency before Obama took office. We used the same data sources as we did above:Electricity: Up 11 percent from 2006 to 2009, or almost 4 percent per year.Natural gas: Down approximately 10 percent in each of the first five months of the year in 2006 and 2009, or a decline of a bit more than 3 percent a year.Home heating oil: Down by less than 1 percent between January 2006 and January 2009Residential propane: Down about 15 percent between January 2006 and January 2009, or about 5 percent per year.Water, sewer and trash collection: Up about 18 percent between July 2006 and July 2009, or about 6 percent a year.Telephone services: Up about 7 percent between July 2006 and July 2009, or more than 2 percent per year.So under President George W. Bush, three of the six utilities we checked saw increases and three saw decreases – not radically different than the four increases and two decreases under Obama.In fact, for the one measurement the Romney campaign specifically cited when we asked -- electricity prices – rates rose at a significantly faster pace under Bush than they did under Obama.Assigning credit and blameFinally, when speakers make claims that seek to assign credit or blame for a particular statistic, PolitiFact typically looks at the question in two ways: Is the statistic right? And is the claim accurate in its assignment of credit or blame?As weve ruled in the past, presidential policies have some impact on the energy sector due to the governments regulatory role. But the international marketplace and other factors play a role as well. Sinclair, the economist, agreed with that assessment.Our rulingRomney said that under the Obama economy ... utility bills are higher.Under Obama, electricity, heating oil, propane and water-sewer-trash prices did rise, as Romney indicated. But natural gas and telephone prices fell.It's important to note the phenomenon is not unique to Obama. In the comparable three years of the Bush presidency, three of the six utility prices also rose.",0.6,0.4,1.0,0.5,0.3,0.5,0.5,1.0,0.4,half-true

Final Rating: Half True","Nationally, the unemployment rate for veterans is far greater than the national unemployment rate, and Wisconsin is one of those rare examples where unemployment is actually lower for veterans than it is for the population as a whole and certainly lower than it is nationally.","Gov. Scott Walker is touting his record on veterans as he tours the country preparing to make a presidential bid.  At a Politics and Pies event May 30, 2015 in New Hampshire, Walker boasted of the success veterans have had finding jobs in Wisconsin. Nationally the unemployment rate for veterans is far greater than the national unemployment rate, Walker said, adding Wisconsin is one of those rare examples where unemployment is actually lower for veterans than it is for the population as a whole and certainly lower than it is nationally.  Are Wisconsin veterans doing that well in the Wisconsin job market?  To support his claim, Walker's team sent a report from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics about veteran and non-veteran employment. This is the best way to make the comparison, as opposed to measuring veterans vs the overall workforce. Lets see how it breaks down. The national picture: Walker said nationally, the unemployment rate for veterans is far greater than the national unemployment rate.  But the national unemployment rate for veterans is actually lower than the rate for non-veterans. For veterans, the rate was 5.3 percent, compared to 6 percent for non-veterans. That's true historically as well.  A report from the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs shows that from 2000 to 2013, veterans had lower unemployment rates than non-veterans. The Wisconsin picture: Walker also said in Wisconsin unemployment is actually lower for veterans than it is for the population.  Wisconsin's rate for veterans was 4.1 percent while the rate for non-veterans was 5.4 percent. So, the state's veterans are employed at higher rates than their civilian counterparts. How rare is it? In his claim, Walker said Wisconsins situation was a rare one. But 32 other states also had veteran unemployment rates lower than non-veterans. Thats not all that rare. Wisconsin vs. national: Finally, Walker said Wisconsin's veteran unemployment rate was certainly lower than it is nationally. Federal data confirms this aspect of the claim, with Wisconsin's veteran unemployment rate at 4.1 percent, while nationally the rate was 5.3 percent. So, the data he provided supported two of the four aspects to his claim. More about the data Comparing the fraction of vets who are unemployed in the state to the fraction of unemployed vets nationally makes sense, said Steven Deller, a professor of economics at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. But unemployment rates dont necessarily show the whole picture. The data takes an average from the last years monthly Current Population Survey of 60,000 households conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau for the Bureau of Labor Statistics. People who have worked at a regular job in the previous week are considered employed, while people who are jobless, looking for a job and available for work are considered unemployed. But the approach doesnt account for workers who are underemployed or employed outside their field, and doesnt take into account discouraged workers who stopped looking for a job. BLS does calculate other unemployment rates, though they are not often cited by politicians or the media. One is known as the U-6, which takes the total of the unemployed, all persons marginally attached to the labor force and involuntary part-time workers. A rule of thumb puts the U-6 rate as double the conventional unemployment rate. The U-6 rate for Wisconsin is 12.1, while the national rate is 13.8. BLS economist Steve Hipple calculated an estimated U-6 rate for veterans nationally at 9.7 percent. BLS doesnt publish state U-6 rates specifically for veterans, . Our rating Walker said Nationally, the unemployment rate for veterans is far greater than the national unemployment rate, and Wisconsin is one of those rare examples where unemployment is actually lower for veterans than it is for the population as a whole and certainly lower than it is nationally.  Data from BLS supported two of the four aspects of his claim and experts cautioned about use of raw statistics.

Final Rating: Half True  ","Our businesses have created nearly twice as many jobs in this recovery as they had at the same point in the last recovery, when there was no Obamacare.","During a speech on the economy in Galesburg, Ill., President Barack Obama touted his record on job creation. Referring to his Republican critics, Obama said in the July 24, 2013, speech, Theyll bring up Obamacare -- this is tried and true -- despite the fact that our businesses have created nearly twice as many jobs in this recovery as businesses had at the same point in the last recovery, when there was no Obamacare. Well first check whether Obama is correct about job growth, and then take a look at the impact of Obamas health care law. The job numbers Because Obama used the term recovery, we started by looking at Bureau of Labor Statistics job numbers for the first 49 months after the official end of the past two recessions -- that is, from November 2001 until November 2005, when George W. Bush was president, and from June 2009 until June 2013, during Obamas tenure. Under Obamas recovery, private-sector employment increased by a little under 6.05 million, compared to 3.17 million during the equivalent period during the Bush recovery. Thats nearly twice as many jobs, as Obama said. And experts say this is a credible way of measuring the numbers. But it isnt the only way. Instead of starting the clock at the official end of the recovery, one could start it from the low point in private-sector employment. These arent the same dates, because a low point private-sector employment isnt the determining factor for pinpointing the end of a recession. Using this method makes Obamas recovery less impressive. During the Bush recovery, private-sector employment continued to tumble all the way to July 2003 -- a year and a half after the recessions official end. By comparison, during the Obama recovery, private-sector employment began to rise in February 2010, just eight months after the official end of the recession. So the extended slide in private-sector jobs under Bush artificially reduced the number of jobs created during the first part of his recovery. If you count from the low point in private-sector jobs instead, the Bush recovery produced 6.35 million private-sector jobs in the first 41 months, compared to 7.20 million in the first 41 months of Obamas recovery. Thats modestly more private-sector jobs under Obama -- but its not nearly twice as many jobs, as he had said. Theres also a third way to look at it -- looking at all jobs, not just private-sector jobs. Using this measurement casts an even more unfavorable light on the Obama recovery, since the government sector has been among the hardest-hit of any job category in the current recession. If you start counting private and government jobs from the low point in employment, the Bush recovery generated slightly more than 7 million total jobs, which actually exceeds the 6.58 million jobs created in the Obama recovery. Two economists we interviewed -- Gary Burtless of the Brookings Institution and Tara Sinclair of George Washington University -- agreed that the alternative measurements are also valid. But by choosing the more favorable of the two statistics, Sinclair said, I think he's cherry-picking. To in any way claim that this labor market is better than what we had in the mid-2000s just doesn't sound fair to me. To be fair, Burtless said, Obama did acknowledge elsewhere in his speech that, Im here to tell you today that we're not there yet. We all know that. We're not there yet. We've got more work to do. The role of Obamacare Obama used the line were checking as a way of countering Republican claims that the presidents signature health care law is a job-killer. The reality is that no one knows yet how much of a job-killer the law is going to be, or if it will be a job-killer at all. Many key provisions of the health care law havent kicked in yet. That includes new rules with fines for large businesses that dont provide their employees with health care. Republicans say the new rules could drive some employers to shed employees or turn them into part-time employees. Sinclair said its possible that some companies may have pre-emptively cut down on employee hours or laid off workers due to the fear of looming Obamacare mandates, or due to certain Obamacare taxes being imposed. However, even if this is happening, its impossible to quantify the impact with any specificity. Obamacares impact on the currently available job data -- either positive or negative -- is still highly speculative. Our ruling Obama said, Our businesses have created nearly twice as many jobs in this recovery as they had at the same point in the last recovery, when there was no Obamacare. Obamas carefully worded claim uses the most advantageous time frame to measure job growth. Other metrics show that the job recovery he has presided over has been similar to, or even weaker than, the job recovery under Bush.",0.5,0.5,1.0,0.5,0.0,0.5,0.5,1.0,0.5,half-true

Final Rating: Mostly True  ",I have always opposed driver's licenses for illegal aliens.,"Republican candidates for an East Texas state Senate seat disagree over whether one of them has endorsed, and voted for, permitting drivers licenses for Texas residents lacking legal permission to live in the country. State Rep.David Simpsonof Longview emailed reporters a Nov. 30, 2015, statement saying Rep. Bryan Hughes of Mineola had slanderously charged Simpson with supporting licenses for illegal immigrants without delivering the factual goods. Simpson further declared: I have always opposed drivers licenses for illegal aliens. We wondered. Some perspective: The Texas Department of Public Safety began requiring license applicants to produce government-issued documents affirming their legal residency status in 2008, and lawmakers voted to require as much in a 2011 special session. Before 2008, according to a July 2011 Texas Tribunenews story, no proof of legal residency was required to obtain a Texas license or state identification card. The spat between Hughes and Simpson developed, we suspect, because Republicans who show weakness on illegal immigration can run into trouble, especially in a party primary. The two are both angling to succeed Kevin Eltife, R-Tyler, representing the Senates District 1. We cant gauge how someone has always felt about an issue. So we limited our scope to signs of Simpson publicly opposing licenses for such immigrants--finding that while theres room for contrary speculation, a little of it caused by his own ambiguous statement, Simpson was among the vast bulk of House members who voted for the 2011 Legislatures mandate to the DPS, arguably a sign he wasnt intent on ensuring that all residents access licenses. News stories Lets start with what Simpson has said in public settings. Hughes campaign pointed out a July 21, 2014, Tyler Morning Telegraphnews storyquoting Simpson after he returned from a weeklong tour of the Rio Grande Valley. We do have a problem with drugs and warlords taking advantage of the situation, Simpson said. We have to require a fulfillment of promises to appear before immigration courts to enter schools. We need to determine the status of these immigrants and not put them in this limbo. They can get an education but not get a drivers license. Thats not right. What wasnt right in Simpsons view wasnt entirely clarified. The story further quoted him saying: We do need to secure the border against crime and terror, in order to defend life, liberty and property. I welcome people to come. We need workers. We do need to limit our health care to emergencies and critical care to immigrants as well as citizens. Whats going on in emergency rooms is not right. We need to stop the freebies, and open the legal pipeline while continuing to secure the border. To our inquiry about Simpsons consistency, Luke Macias, a consultant to Simpsons campaign, guided us to Simpsons 2014 98-slidepresentationbased on the legislators border trip, which includedphotos of his travels and thoughts about border and immigration policy. Macias urged us to notethe slide indicating Simpson thinks Texas should overturn the mandate to educate aliens who have entered the country illegally or who are still residents of Mexico. A1982 U.S. Supreme Court decision, in Plyler v. Doe, required Texas not to deny public education to undocumented school-age children. Another Simpson slide, titled Dysfunctional Policies, including this license line: We provide K-12 education, but students cannot receive a drivers license:  SOURCE:Presentation,A Sobering and Beautiful Week on the Rio Grande,David Simpson, June 30-July 6, 2014 (web link received by email from Luke Macias, general consultant, David Simpson Texas Senate campaign, Dec. 1, 2015) What gives? By phone, Simpsontold us he was trying to stress his continuing belief in not giving handouts and privileges to immigrants living here without permission; those include drivers licenses, he said. By email, Simpson noted accurately that while his presentation called for some changes--such as ending the public schooling of children in the country illegally--it did not advocate for giving drivers licenses to illegals. Our searches via the Nexis news database and through news stories published by the LongviewNews-Journalyielded no examples of Simpson previously offering an opinion on drivers licenses forimmigrants. Simpsons legislative record Next, we took up Simpsons legislative record. In summer 2011, lawmakers moved to require the DPS to seek proof of legal residency from applicants for drivers licenses by placingan amendment on a fiscal matters measure. At the time, the move was pitched as bringing Texas into compliance with the federal REAL ID Act, which says applicants for a driver's license must prove legal residency if they want to use the identification to get through airport security. See the agency's explanation here. And on June 9, 2011, nearly all House members (including Simpson) approved the amendment toSenate Bill 1. House video reveals no debate of the matter after Rep. Charles Geren, R-Fort Worth, told colleaguesthe amendmentaddresses an issue of people getting Texas drivers licenses that dont live in Texas and it also allows the department to issue a license only for the length of time that a person is entitled to be here.According to the House Journal, eight members, Simpson not among them, asked to be recorded voting against the amendment. Records show too that Simpson voted against the overall fiscal matters proposal several times; the votes occurred onJune 9,June 10andJune 28, 2011. By email, Simpsons told us he opposed the measure due to its accounting gimmicks—namely, the deferment of Foundation School Program payments and the speed-up of tax payments—and its misplaced priorities, not because of the license provision, which I supported. He provided a copy of aMay 2012 letterto constituents stating that he voted for the amendment to add documentation requirements for driver's licenses but against SB 1 because it extended inequitable school funding, sped tax collections and used smoke and mirrors to balance the state budget. So, Simpson backed the mandate that DPS check on each applicants legal residency. Two years later, though, Simpson cast a vote at leastleaving room for speculation about his consistency on this front. That year, he voted against successful House efforts effectively killing proposals that related to more residents possibly getting driving permits. We know of no independent way of telling if those votes signaled a position on drivers licenses. But on May 20, 2013, Simpson voted in favor of one of the failed amendments, theTexas House Journalshows. The amendment to Senate Bill 1729 by Rep. Byron Cook, R-Corsicana, said that under the legislation, which otherwise authorized a pilot project enabling a few counties to update or renew drivers licenses, a license should include any Texas resident drivers permit authorized by law. And what did that mean? In debate, opponents said Cooks language related to unauthorized residents getting a drivers permit. Similarly, Simpson and Hughes campaign each nudged, conservative advocacy groups characterized the amendment as opening drivers licenses to ineligible individuals. In ascorecard of the 2013 Legislature, for instance, the Young Conservatives of Texas said Cooks amendment would have allowed for illegal immigrants to receive drivers licenses. We didnt reach that conclusion--and by email, Simpson told us Cooks amendment in no way authorized illegal aliens to receive drivers licenses. Asked why he voted for it, Simpson said: I voted yes to the amendment because it would only include licenses or permits already authorized by law. In debate, Cook didnt dispute that his proposal might legalize more drivers; he also stressed that another change in law would be needed for the envisioned permits to become a reality. Cooks proposal drew 72 votes, with 67 members voting no, but it died because Cook offered the proposal during final consideration of SB 1729; at that stage, 100 House votes were needed to amend legislation. A few days earlier, on May 17, 2013, Cook rolled out a longer amendment to SB 1729. He described the proposal--which was shortly derailed on a parliamentary point of order without members (including Simpson) voting on it--as identical to a committee-approved version ofHouse Bill 3206by Rep. Roberto Alonzo, D-Dallas. Alonzos amended plan called for state-issued driving permits for residents who lack proof of legal residency, also requiring recipients to obtain auto insurance. Under the proposal, every applicant would have to submit to fingerprinting and clear a criminal background check before qualifying for a permit. The same month, Hughes campaign noted, Simpson was on the losing end of an 87-60 House vote setting aside Alonzos amendment to aHouse measurethat authorized the state to let public schools and driving schools give the driving test required to get a license. Before that May 21, 2013, action, Alonzo told House colleagues that under his amendment, schools could give driving tests to individuals who obtained resident driving permits, provided such permits were legalized. Texas has a problem, Alonzo said, with people driving without auto insurance or a drivers permit. By phone, Alonzo told us he favors giving undocumented individuals an opportunity to legally drive in Texas and his 2013 proposals described permits could have nudged the state toward fulfilling the goal though, he said, it didnt provide for full-fledged licenses. Finally, we spotted no evidence of Simpson trying to legislate about drivers licenses. In the 2011 session, Simpson authored or co-authored about 50 measures, none touching on giving or denying licenses. In the 2013 and 2015 sessions, Simpsonauthored or co-authorednearly 150 measures, none of them affecting drivers licenses. Our ruling Simpson said hes always been opposed to illegal immigrants having drivers licenses In 2011, Simpson joined House members in voting for the change in law requiring license applicants to document their legal residency, which we take as a strong indication of his position. But theres a hint of uncertainty in Simpsons 2013 vote on a proposal offered in favor of unauthorized residents someday getting resident driver permits as sought by Alonzo and others, which importantly didnt and dont exist, and his ambiguous 2014 remark about drivers licenses.

Final Rating: Mostly True  ","Under Ted Cruzs tax plan, businesses will now have to pay 16 percent on the money they make. They will also have to pay 16 percent on the money they pay their employees.","Ted Cruzs tax plan, envisioning tax returns that fit on postcards, would whack businesses twice over, Marco Rubio says. We wondered about that. In the Jan. 14, 2016, Fox Business Network Republican presidential debate in North Charleston, S.C., Sen. Rubio of Florida said that under the plan advocated by Sen. Cruz of Texas, businesses basically will have to pay a tax, both on the money they make, but they also have to pay taxes on the money that they pay their employees. A moment later, Rubio said Cruzs plan does not eliminate the corporate (income) tax or the payroll tax. Businesses will now have to pay 16 percent on the money they make. They will also have to pay 16 percent on the money they pay their employees. Cruz disputed that characterization, saying in part that a critical piece that Marco seems to be missing is that this 16 percent business flat tax enables us to eliminate the corporate income tax. It goes away. Cruzs plan replaces the corporate income tax, the payroll tax and others with a flat tax. Does it also make businesses pay 16 percent on profits and payroll, as Rubio said? Cruzs plan outlined After emailing Rubios campaign about how he reached his 16 percent conclusions, we turned to Cruzs tax plan as outlined by his campaign. Under the Simple Flat Tax, Cruz says on a campaign webpage, the current seven rates of personal income tax will collapse into a single low rate of 10 percent. For a family of four, the first $36,000 will be tax-free. The Child Tax Credit will remain in place, Cruz proposes, and the plan revamps the earned-income tax credit while preserving deductions for charitable contributions and mortgage interest payments. Heres the flat-tax postcard as envisioned by Cruz:  SOURCE: Web page, The Simple Tax Plan, Ted Cruz presidential campaign (viewed Jan. 20, 2016) Next up: the 16 percent element. On Cruzs website, we spotted no direct indication the 16 percent would apply to payroll spending. For businesses, Cruz says there, the corporate income tax will be eliminated. It will be replaced by a simple Business Flat Tax at a single 16 percent rate. The current payroll tax system will be abolished, while maintaining full funding for Social Security and Medicare. Cruz further says the business flat tax will be based on revenues minus expenses such as equipment, computers, and other business investments. In general, Cruz says, his proposed tax overhaul will deliver a tremendous economic boost, according to the well-respected Tax Foundation, a Washington, D.C., nonprofit that describes itself as a leading independent tax policy research organization. Independent breakdowns We fetched the foundations October 2015 analysis of Cruzs plan which, the foundation said, would replace the corporate income tax and all payroll taxes with a 16 percent Business Transfer Tax, or subtraction method value-added tax. In addition, his plan would repeal a number of complex features of the current tax code. Farther along, the analysis spelled out a payroll aspect. Specifically, the foundation said, Cruzs plan: Enacts a broad-based, 16 percent Business Transfer Tax or value-added tax. This tax is levied on all business profits, less capital investment. This would include the payroll of business, government, and nonprofit institutions, as well as net imports. The tax would exempt from taxation the purchase of health insurance. A business transfer tax is also often known as a subtraction-method value-added tax. While its base is identical in economic terms to that of the credit-invoice VAT seen in many OECD countries, it is calculated from corporate accounts, not on individual transactions. The foundation also said: Under current law, some taxes on labor are explicitly levied on nominal wages, reducing take-home pay, while others are implicitly passed on to workers through lower nominal wages. The business transfer tax would also fall substantially on payrolls, but it would do so entirely through implicit reductions in nominal wages rather than explicit reductions in take-home pay. Thats a bit gobbledy-gooky for us. A foundation official, Kyle Pomerleau, told us by phone and email that what Rubio said largely holds up, though it would be wrong to conclude businesses under Cruzs plan would pay 16 percent on the same money twice. That is, Pomerleau elaborated, Cruzs plan eliminates the existing payroll tax, which is 15.3 percent of wages (half of that paid by employers, the other half by employees), but the plan counts payroll expenditures as part of net business profits, which are taxed at 16 percent. Even though his plan gets rid of the payroll tax, Pomerleau emailed, his new Business Flat Tax will end up taxing that payroll by disallowing its deduction at the business level. Another authority, Joe Rosenberg of the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center, told us by phone that Rubio was accurate about Cruzs plan presuming he meant what most people define as profit by his phrase what you make. Rosenberg walked us through how he sees Cruzs plan working: Say a business buys something for 50 cents at wholesale and has to pay its employees 50 cents, accumulating $1 in costs. Then the business sells the something for $1.10, drawing a 10-cent profit. Under the Cruz plan, Rosenberg said, the business pays the flat tax solely on the 60-cent difference between the $1.10 in sales and the 50 cents spent on the wholesale purchase. And, Rosenberg noted, theres another way to pin what Cruzs plan subjects to the 16 percent tax -- by isolating what the business makes, the 10 cents, and then adding the 50 cents in employee payroll. Its very fair to interpret what Sen. Rubio said as correct, Rosenberg said, though its also worth mention (again) that Cruzs plan eliminates existing payroll and income taxes. Broadly, Rosenberg didnt agree that Cruzs plan whipsaws businesses, saying: Its a change in the way theyre taxed. Its not taxing something twice. We didnt hear back from Rubios camp about his claim nor did Cruz aides engage. Footnote: A Jan. 14, 2016, foundation post by economist Alan Cole says Cruz and Rubio arent proposing entirely distinct tax approaches. In fact, Cole wrote, if you put together two taxes from Rubios plan (and fiddle with the rates), you can actually synthetically construct the business flat tax from Cruzs plan! Our ruling Rubio said that under Cruzs tax plan, businesses will now have to pay 16 percent on the money they make. They will also have to pay 16 percent on the money they pay their employees. Under Cruzs plan, that rate applies both to net income and payroll expenditures though the way this description was phrased by Rubio merits clarification. That is, the 16 percent would not be applied to what a business makes and separately applied again to money paid to employees. Also unsaid: The proposed tax would replace taxes including payroll and income taxes. MOSTLY TRUE – The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information.

Final Rating: Mostly True  ","We took a deal to the president just last February, less than a year ago -- $25 billion over 10 years in border security done the right way -and the president blew up the deal.","Sen. Tim Kaine says President Donald Trump was once offered all the money he wanted for Southern border security, and turned it down. His comments came during a Jan.9 interview on CNN, amid a federal government shutdown over disagreements on funding to expand a security wall on the Southern border.Trump is demanding $5.7 billion for project; congressional Democrats are drawing the line at $1.3 billion. Kaine said his fellow Democrats have tried in the past to compromise with Trump on border security, but to no avail. We took a deal to the president just last February, less than a year ago - $25 billion over 10 years in border security done the right way - and the president blew up the deal, Kaine said. We wondered whether Kaines statement is accurate. Miryam Lipper, the senators spokesperson, referred us to a short-lived bill the senator co-sponsored in February 2018. The Senate was intensely debating immigration. Trump had announced that on March 5, he would begin winding down the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program - or DACA - that protects from deportation children who were brought to the U.S. as illegal immigrants. The Senate was seeking a broad compromise with Trump on immigration policies that would save DACA before the March 5 deadline. Trump backed a Republican bill that would have appropriated $25 billion for border security. The legislation honored four conditions the president set for continuing DACA: Provide money to build the wall; Establish a path to citizenship for DACA children, or dreamers; End the visa lottery program that promotes ethnic diversity of immigrants, and Severely limit family-based immigration - what Trump calls chain immigration. Ending the diversity visa lottery and restricting family-based immigration - which the Democrats call family reunification -were anathema to Democrats. Without bipartisan support, the bill couldnt reach the 60 votes needed to end debate on it and to advance to a pass-or-fail roll call. So Democrats and a handful Republicans - on Feb. 14, 2018 - introduced a substitute bill that they hoped would muster enough bipartisan backing to pass the 60-vote cloture rule. The measure called for $25 billion in border spending over 10 years for wall construction and a host of other security measures. The bill, however, did not address Trumps demands to end the lottery and narrow family-based immigration. On Feb. 15, White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sandersissued a statement threatening Trump would vetothe substitute bill. Trump, in tweets, called the bill a total catastrophe, that would create mass amnesty for over 10 million illegal aliens, including criminals. The Washington Post and The New York Times reported that Trump also objected that the bill wouldallocatethe $25 billion over 10 years, instead of all at once. Later that day, the bill failed. Although a bipartisan group of 54 senators voted for cloture - a majority - they came short of the 60 votes needed to advance. Minutes later, the Republican bill backed by Trump also died. Congress failed to reach the March 5 deadline to protect DACA, but the phase-out of the program has put on hold by several courts. Our ruling Kaine said, We took a deal to the president just last February, less than a year ago -$25 billion over 10 years in border security done the right way -and the president blew up the deal. Hes referring to a 2018 bill backed by Senate Democrats and a few Republicans that would have provided $25 billion over a decade to significantly expand the wall and fund other programs to improve Southern border security. Trump vehemently opposed the bill and threatened to veto it because it did not contain two immigration reforms he demanded: ending the visa lottery and deeply restricting family-based immigration. We quibble, however, with Kaines use of the term deal, which suggests everything was guaranteed for passage if the president went along. Republicans lawmakers never made that promise.

Final Rating: Mostly True  ","Just in the Austin MSA alone, 150 people move here every day.","An activist questioning plans to include a U.S. citizenship question in the 2020 Census warned that if fewer Texans fill out the decennial survey, the state could be shorted government aid and full representation, both tied to population counts. Additionally, I want to just emphasize the growth of Texas, Jose Carrillo of the NALEO Educational Fund said at a March 28, 2018, Texas Capitol press conference. The fund is part of the National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials. Just in the Austin MSA alone, Carrillo said, 150 people move here every day. So those folks need resources, and government needs to provide those resources. MSA means metropolitan statistical area. Its been a spell since weve fact-checked how many people flock to the state's capital and stick around. But in 2014, we found Mostly False a claim that 110 people a day were moving to Austin alone. That figure was in the ballpark for the number of people moving to the five-county region, as Ryan Robinson, the city demographer, reaffirmed in a 2018 statement he emailed to our renewed inquiry. We concluded before, though, that Austin alone was netting perhaps 40 to 60 additional residents a day. Carrillo cites net growth So, whats the latest in population changes in the region encompassing Travis, Williamson, Hays, Caldwell and Bastrop counties? By phone, Carrillo told us he got his tally from the Greater Austin Chamber of Commerce. The chambers Beverly Kerr subsequently told us she drew on the latest annual U.S. Census Bureau estimate that as of July 2017, the Austin-Round Rock MSAs population totaled 2,115,827, up 55,269 from 2,060,558 the year before. That breaks out to regional growth of 151 people a day over the 12 months taking into account both people coming from other places and local births continuing to outpace deaths, Kerr and Lloyd Potter, the Texas state demographer, each advised by email. In the MSA, the bureau says, births over the 12 months outpaced deaths by 16,791, with the difference accounting for 46 of the regions 151 new residents a day. Put another way, net migration into the region occurred at a rate of 105 residents a day. In reality, Kerr wrote, a good deal more than 105 people or 150 people move to Austin each day, but a lot of people move out, too. Fewer people leave We asked both experts to speak solely to Carrillo's focus on people moving into theregion. Kerr noted that the bureaus 2016 American Community Survey estimated that 129,119 of 2,030,464 Austin-Round Rock region residents over 1 year old had moved to the area in the same year from a different region or from abroad--which breaks out to a (gulp-inducing) 354 incoming residents a day. Potter noted separately that per five-year ACS estimates, 211 people a day moved out of the Austin region to another U.S. locale; the survey doesnt tally people whove left for another country. All told, Potter said by email, the five-year ACS results suggest the region was netting 138 people a day in the period, counting more than 350 new residents a day. It's worth stressing that the approximately 350 new residents a day estimate is one-sided in that itdoesnt take into account people leaving the region. Potter counseled too that the ACS count wasbased on annualizing responses to surveys and then statistical weighting of responses, meaning theres sampling error at work, he said. In sum, Potter wrote, I think it is most accurate to say there were, on average, 151 additional residents per day between July 1, 2016 and July 1, 2017 and that on average, 105 of the additional residents are the result of net-migration. Our ruling Carrillo said: Just in the Austin MSA alone, 150 people move here every day. The five-county regions population grew by 151 people a day in the 12 months up to July 2017, according to the latest annual federal estimate. This growth was mostly due to people moving in outpacing people leaving the region with a third of the net growth tied to local births outpacing deaths. But specific to what Carrillo said, Census Bureau work rooted in surveys taken in the five years through 2015 suggests that about 350 people a day were moving into the region. It's worth stressing, though, that thisfigure doesn't account for people who (inexplicably) skedaddled. MOSTLY TRUE – The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information.

Final Rating: Mostly True  ","In Florida felonies can be things like buying weed, tampering with an odometer or disturbing a lobster trap. So basically spring break.","Comedian Samantha Bee traveled to Florida, where she says retirees and democracy go to die, to shed light on how the state makes it difficult for felons to regain the right to vote. On her TBS show Full Frontal on May 10, Bee spotlighted efforts by advocates to collect about 700,000 signatures to place a question on the 2018 ballot. The amendment, which would have to pass by 60 percent to be enacted, calls for restoring voting rights for felons automatically for those who have fully completed their sentences including parole or probation. That would not apply to those convicted of murder or sexual offenses who would still have to ask the Cabinet to restore their rights, a process which is currently slow and cumbersome. In Florida, about 1.7 million felons have lost their right to vote. Bee portrayed some of those felonies as not so serious. In Florida felonies can be things like buying weed, tampering with an odometer or disturbing a lobster trap, Bee said. So basically spring break. Bees big point: Felons in Florida arent just axe murderers. We will fact-check if the crimes Bee cited are felonies. A spokesman for Bee declined to comment on the record. Under the Florida Constitution, a convicted felon cannot vote, serve on a jury, or hold public office until civil rights have been restored. The policy stems back to the Jim Crow era. And that doesnt only apply to violent offenses, said Randall Berg of the Florida Justice Institute. Any felony conviction in Florida, no matter how small or seemingly trivial, results in the loss of your civil rights, Berg said. There have been efforts on and off since the 1970s to make the process easier. But in 2011, Gov. Rick Scott and the members of the Florida Cabinetdecided to make the process more cumbersome and set a minimumfive-year waiting period. Through April 1, 2017, about 2,600 felons have gotten their rights restored since 2011, while more than 10,000 cases are pending. Bee cited three statutes that are felonies in Florida:  • 893.13 (2) (a) 2: This statute bans buying or possession with intent to sell drugs, including marijuana which is a third-degree felony. Possession of a small amount of cannabis -- less than 20 grams -- is a misdemeanor. • 319.35 (1) (a) tampering with an odometer: It is unlawful for any person knowingly to tamper with, adjust, alter, set back, disconnect, or fail to connect an odometer of a motor vehicle, or to cause any of the foregoing to occur to an odometer of a motor vehicle, so as to reflect a lower mileage than the motor vehicle has actually been driven... This is a third-degree felony. • 379.367 (4) disturbing a lobster trap: It is unlawful for any person willfully to molest any spiny lobster traps, lines, or buoys belonging to another without permission of the license holder. This is a third-degree felony. While we were unable to find any data on how many people had lost their rights based on particular statutes, we did obtain conviction data for the statutes Bee cited from the Florida Department of Law Enforcement. Here are the convictions for those offenses between 2012 and 2016, which make up a tiny slice of all felony convictions in that period: • Buying or possessing marijuana: 398 felony convictions with specification of marijuana. • Messing with an odometer: 1felony conviction • Disturbing a lobster trap: 4felony convictions Marc Mauer, executive director of the Sentencing Project, pointed to national data for 2006 that showed about 18 percent of felony convictions in state courts were for violent offenses. The majority of convictions were drug and property offenses. We tend to think of felonies as being represented in the prison population, but that's a skewed view that doesn't incorporate the more numerous people who are sentenced to some type of probation or community service, Mauer said. Bee interviewed one person who opposes automatic restoration of rights for felons generally: Roger Clegg, a former deputy assistant attorney general in the Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush administrations. He has called for states to address restoration on a case-by-case basis. Clegg said that of course some crimes appear less serious than others, but the ones Bee cited are serious for the victims. For example, if someone sells a car that has 200,000 miles on it but has tampered with the odometer to show only 20,000 miles, that is cheating the buyer out of thousands of dollars. You can ask someone who makes his or her living as a lobster fisherman if its a trivial matter if someone molests (the statutes word) his or her traps, he said. Bee said, In Florida felonies can be things like buying weed, tampering with an odometer or disturbing a lobster trap. So basically spring break. Bee is correct that these crimes are felonies on the books in Florida. Only a handful of felony convictions for tampering with an odometer or disturbing a lobster trap in recent years. The drug statute she cited resulted in about 400 felony convictions related to marijuana. For small amounts of marijuana, the crime is a misdemeanor.",1.0,0.1,1.0,0.8,0.5,0.2,0.3,1.0,0.7,mostly-true

Final Rating: Mostly True  ",We've had 27 (Ebola) outbreaks around the globe and they've never spread outside of the confines of the countries that were initially affected.,"The latest news on Ebola finally seems to be headed in the right direction. The World Health Organization declared Nigeria and Senegal to be Ebola-free. None of the people who lived in the apartment of Thomas Eric Duncan, the man who died in Dallas, have contracted the disease. Beyond the two nurses now in treatment, there are no reports that hospital staff who helped care for Duncan have the virus. While the situation in Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea remains dire, more equipment and medical professionals are arriving on the scene. Based on all this, MSNBC host Chris Hayes took an optimistic stance during his show on Oct. 20. It is a disease that can be wrestled to the ground and essentially snuffed out the way you might fight a forest fire, Hayes said. If there's sufficient resources in those three West African countries. Hayes guest, pediatrician and health care television personality Corey Hebert, backed up that view. We've had 27 outbreaks around the globe and they've never spread outside of the confines of the countries that were initially affected, Hebert said. So, it's not something that we have to worry about like in the movie Outbreak. It's not like that. The 1995 film Outbreak did pretty well at the box office, but our fact-check focuses on Heberts numbers, not his taste in movies. We emailed him to learn where he got his figures and did not hear back. We found two lists of Ebola outbreaks, and while it's pretty clear thatHebert overshot the number of outbreaks, his general point is accurate. In the past, thanks to public health efforts, the virus has not spread beyond the borders of the countries that were first affected. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention lists a total of 34 incidents involving one strain or another of the Ebola virus since it was first identified in 1976 in Zaire. However, not every incident meets the definition of an outbreak. In places such as England, Italy and Russia, some people caught it in their labs. A strain of the virus infected some pigs in the Philippines and some workers there developed antibodies but never showed any symptoms. There were instances where just a single person died.If you discount exposures in the laboratory, infections of animals, you are left with 19 outbreaks before the current one. Add in the three lone deaths unrelated to a lab exposure, and the total is 22. The World Health Organization has its own list that doesnt include lab or animal infections. Its list has 20episodes andincludes four incidents in which there was a single death or no deaths at all. Adjusting for those individual cases, the WHOs outbreak count is 16. Heres the WHO list: Year Country Cases Deaths 2012 Democratic Republic of Congo 57 29 2012 Uganda 7 4 2012 Uganda 24 17 2011 Uganda 1 1 2008 Democratic Republic of Congo 32 14 2007 Uganda 149 37 2007 Democratic Republic of Congo 264 187 2005 Congo 12 10 2004 Sudan 17 7 2001-02 Congo 59 44 2001-02 Gabon 65 53 2000 Uganda 425 224 1996 South Africa (ex-Gabon) 1 1 1995 Democratic Republic of Congo 315 254 1994 Cote d'Ivoire 1 0 1994 Gabon 52 31 1979 Sudan 34 22 1977 Democratic Republic of Congo 1 1 1976 Sudan 284 151 1976 Democratic Republic of Congo 318 280 Source: World Health Organization In both tallies, each outbreak happened in just one country. The current crisis is the first where Ebola has hit several nations simultaneously. (Through Oct. 17, Ebola has affected seven countries and 9,216 people have been diagnosed with the virus. There are4,555 reported deaths so far.) A likely explanation for the difference this time has to do with where the virus struck, and not the nature of the disease itself. Accordingto a recent article in the New England Journal of Medicine, the latest outbreak started in Guinea in December 2013. That was a very unfortunate location with many residents and decent transportation.There are plenty of roads that allow the people in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia to move easily among the three countries and between rural areas and dense urban centers. But the research team that wrote the article said that the biological characteristics of the virus are largely the same. Quick and robust public health measures could have stopped the Ebola outbreak early, but the steps that were taken fell short. The critical determinant of epidemic size appears to be the speed of implementation of rigorous control measures, the article authors wrote. Our ruling Hebert said there have been 27 outbreaks of of Ebola and in no case did the disease spread to a second country. His number is high. A more accurate figure would be between 16 and 22. However, he is correct in his main point,that past efforts have successfully contained the disease. The combination of an exaggerated number and an accurate assessment of the importance of thepublic health response leads us to rate this claim Mostly True.",0.6,0.5,1.0,0.5,0.0,0.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,mostly-true

Final Rating: Mostly True  ",The average bridge in Missouri is 48 years old — most were only designed to last for 50 years.,"The Missouri Department of Transportations chronic lack of funding isnt very surprising anymore. Just last November, Missouri voters rejected Proposition D, which would have increased the states gas tax by 10 cents and used the funds to boost spending on roads and bridges. Without the additional funding, MoDOT counts on federal grant money to address infrastructure problems like the one posed by Missouris aging bridges. In his Aug. 29 newsletter, U.S. Rep. Sam Graves, R-Mo., announced that MoDOT will receive a $20.7 million federal grant for the states bridge replacement program. To highlight the significance of the challenges, Graves said, The average bridge in Missouri is 48 years old—most were only designed to last for 50 years. The problem sounds severe and a little dangerous, so we decided to see if the numbers hold up. To a degree, they do — Graves took the sentence from the MoDOT website. But that doesnt mean its time to panic every time you drive over a bridge. MoDOTs website confirms that the average age of Missouri bridges is 48 years old. An average takes into account all bridges from newly built ones to those much older than 48 years. So how old are Missouris oldest bridges? We dont know. State bridge engineer Dennis Heckman pointed out a lack of records before about 1900. About 40 bridges were built before 1909; they are at least 110 years old and might be even older. Heckman explained that design life doesnt mean a bridge closes or becomes unsafe on its 50th birthday. Intended design life is not a set expiration date. In reality, its more like a sell-by date that indicates when a bridges quality needs to be monitored more closely. When they reach that age, youre going to be maintaining them a lot more, fixing them a lot more, Heckman said. They just become a lot more high maintenance. Theres also some variation in the design life of Missouris bridges to take into account. For decades, Heckman said,a 50-year design life was standard, and about 8,000 of MoDOTs 10,400 bridges have a design life of 50 years. In the past 10 to 15 years, designing bridges with a 75-year life span has become more common; about 2,350 bridges were built to this standard. And longer, river-crossing bridges are built with a design life of 100 years. About 50 bridges currently fall into this 100-year design life category. In total, 6,000, or 60%, of Missouris bridges are past their intended design life, and Heckman said MoDOTs ability to extend the lifespan of these bridges is unique to each bridge and its specific conditions. But bridge condition, not intended design life, is what determines MoDOTs course of action. Federal law requires all publicly owned highway bridges over 20 feet long tobe inspected about once every two years, and currently, 909 of the bridges MoDOT inspects are rated poor by federal National Bridge Inspection Standards. Poor is the worst rating a bridge can receive and remain open for use. Poor bridges result in weight limits that hinder economic development and reduce Missourians safety, Heckman said. Heavier trucks cant use them. Farmers cant use them when theyre hauling their grain or hogs to market. So you end up with a lot of detours. He also said many bridges cannot support the weight of a school bus, firetruck, or ambulance. Most states strive to have only about 3% to 4% of their bridges ranked poor, Heckman said. Currently, 9% of Missouris bridges are poor. At our current funding levels, were basically treading water, said Bob Brendel, MoDOTs special assignments coordinator. Were basically repairing and replacing about as many bridges every year as fall into the poor category. Graves said, The average bridge in Missouri is 48 years old — most were only designed to last for 50 years. This statement comes directly from MoDOTs data on state bridges, but it needs a bit of clarification. Most bridges dont need to be replaced when they turn 50. Thats when engineers could expect them to need more maintenance. Condition, not design life, determines the death of a bridge",1.0,0.0,1.0,0.8,0.0,0.0,0.5,1.0,0.8,mostly-true

Final Rating: Mostly True  ","About 230,000 people that were on unemployment when I took office are not on unemployment now.","A radio host recently asked Gov. Rick Scott for an update on his trademark 7-7-7 plan -- creating 700,000 jobs in seven years in seven steps. (We're tracking that promise on the Scott-O-Meter.)Scott said Floridas economy is getting better in a lot of ways.Were doing well. Were at a three-year low on our unemployment in this state... We generated around 100,000 net jobs so far, if you look at the federal numbers, he said in the April 18, 2012, interview with Orlando-based station WDBO. But if you look at the state numbers, about 230,000 people that were on unemployment when I took office are not on unemployment now.When you look around the state, tourism is up, the home markets up, home sales are up, home prices are up.  So good things are happening, but we still have 900,000 people out of work, he said.What stuck out to us is his claim that 230,000 fewer people receive unemployment benefits than when he took office 15 months ago. That sounds like a drastic decrease, which Scott is taking credit for and in turn using as evidence that the states economy is improving.A spokeswoman with the states Department of Economic Opportunity, the agency that manages the unemployment compensation program, responded to our request about Scotts claim. Spokeswoman Nancy Blum said the number of people receiving unemployment compensation dropped from 561,736 on Jan. 31, 2011, to 345,052 on March 31, 2012. Thats a total decline of 216,684.Thats pretty close to about 230,000, which is the number Scott offered.Whether Scott is right to take credit for the decline -- and whether that is translating to a better Florida economy -- is more complicated.In 2011 and 2012, Scott and Florida lawmakers made a series of changes to the states unemployment compensation program that generally make it harder for people to receive benefits.Among them: Meanwhile, businesses got tax breaks. A 2012 bill reduces unemployment compensation taxes for businesses by at least $50 per employee, with savings of $276 million the first year.The Miami Workers Center asked the U.S. Department of Labors civil rights division to investigate Floridas unemployment compensation system over allegations that these changes act as barriers to people who deserve checks but cant get them for lack of computer access or reading skills. A Labor department spokesman told us the investigation is ongoing.The governors number in and of itself does not demonstrate any kind of economic recovery in Florida, said Valory Greenfield, staff attorney for Florida Legal Services, which represents the workers center. What it tells me based on our experience working with claimants is that fewer people who are potentially eligible are getting into the program.In fact, since August 2011 the department has denied 131,115 applicants for failing to comply with the new law, mostly for failing to fulfill the work search or the initial skills assessment.Those denials resulted in a $30.3 million savings. Economists said Scott's number, while accurate, isn't necessarily a great economic measure on its own. They also said it's too soon to tell if Florida's more stringent eligibility requirements play a big role in the declining number of recipients. Part of the drop-off could be attributed to people whose benefits have expired. Since December 2011, 30,600 people have exhausted all state and federal unemployment benefits, according to the department.So far I havent been able to see any hard data or evidence to quantify (either) effect, said Mekael Teshome, PNC Financial Services Group economist.Whats more relevant, Teshome said, is that jobless claims have been coming down since their peak in mid 2009, well before Scott took office. That somewhat undermines the idea that the drop is thanks to Scott. In fact, if you started counting in 2010 instead of 2011 when Scott took office, even fewer people -- 300,770 -- are receiving unemployment benefits. Some experts also pointed to the contracting size of the labor force, which helps to lower the unemployment rate but also indicates some people are no longer looking for work. About 15,000 people left the labor force from February, according to the states March 2012 labor report. The 15,000-person drop in the labor force was part of the reason why the unemployment rate fall from 9.4 percent in February to 9 percent in March.Some of those are people whose benefits ran out and are now not looking for work, said Chris McCarty, director of the University of Floridas Bureau of Economic and Business Research. Some of those are retirees who have left the labor force permanently.Our rulingScotts claim that 230,000 fewer people are receiving unemployment benefits than when he entered office is pretty close to the actual drop (216,684). A couple of caveats here. The figure is not completely an indicator that the economy is improving, as Scott suggests, and is somewhat the result of a strict new state law. Also, the trend of jobless claims started falling in mid 2009, more than a year before Scott took office. That undercuts, to a point, the suggestion Scott should get the credit. Scotts statement is accurate but can use some additional information. Thats our definition of Mostly True.",0.9,0.2,1.0,0.8,0.0,0.2,0.5,0.8,0.7,mostly-true

Final Rating: Mostly True  ","President-elect Trump's immigration policies are very similar to policies that are sitting right in the Senate and the House today to temporarily suspend immigration from countries that harbor terrorism, to temporarily suspend immigration from Syria until we get better vetting.","Reince Priebus, the chairman of the Republican National Committee and future chief of staff for President-elect Donald Trump, dismissed criticism that legislators from his party and Trump were at odds on a series of issues. During the presidential campaign, Trump disagreed with House Speaker Paul Ryan and other Republicans over mass deportations, trade, Social Security and Medicare, said Steve Rattner, a former adviser to President Barack Obama and an economic analyst on MSNBCs Morning Joe. How are you guys going to resolve those conflicts? Rattner asked Priebus on the Nov. 14 show. Well, there's not that many, the conflicts aren't as great as you're outlining, Priebus responded. President-elect Trump's immigration policies are very similar to policies that are sitting right in the Senate and the House today, to temporarily suspend immigration from countries that harbor terrorism, to temporarily suspend immigration from Syria until we get better vetting. That's not extreme, that's exactly what is in the House today. Is Priebus right? We decided to check whether there currently are immigration policies in Congress similar to Trumps proposals. Trumps immigration policies On the campaign trail, Trump promised to build a wall to stop illegal immigration and to be tough on people who violated immigration laws. While he was inconsistent about his plans for the estimated 11 million people in the country illegally, he was firm on deporting criminals. Trump also said he would limit legal immigration because immigration flows are too large to perform adequate screening. Trump repeatedly criticized his Democratic challenger, Hillary Clinton, for wanting to increase the number of refugees admitted into the United States from Syria, a country afflicted by terrorism. When I am elected, I will suspend immigration from areas of the world when there is a proven history of terrorism against the United States, Europe or our allies, until we understand how to end these threats, Trump said June 13, 2016. In December 2015, Trump called for a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our country's representatives can figure out what is going on. That comment came after a deadly attack in San Bernardino, Calif. In his 10-point immigration plan, Trump said he would suspend the issuance of visas to any place where adequate screening cannot occur, until proven and effective vetting mechanisms can be put into place. Congress policies We reached out to the Republican National Committee, chaired by Priebus, to find out which congressional policies specifically mirror Trumps immigration proposals. We did not get a response from the committee or from the House Republican Conference. So we did some digging on our own. A bill called the American SAFE Act of 2015 was introduced in the House a year ago, calling for additional screening of covered aliens, to ensure they are not a threat to national security. The bill defines a covered alien as a person applying for admission as a refugee and who is a national or resident of Iraq or Syria; has no nationality and whose last habitual residence was in Iraq or Syria; or has been present in Iraq or Syria at any time on or after March 1, 2011. Individuals cannot be admitted as refugees until the FBI director certifies to the Secretary of Homeland Security and to the National Intelligence director that background investigations sufficiently determined they are not a threat to national security, the bill said. A refugee may also only be admitted after the Secretary of Homeland Security -- in unanimous agreement with the directors of the FBI and National Intelligence -- certifies to 12 appropriate Congressional Committees that the person is not a national security threat. The American SAFE Act of 2015 was introduced by Rep. Michael T. McCaul, R-Texas, and co-sponsored by 102 Republicans and one Democrat. It passed the House Nov. 19, 2015, with a 289-137 vote and stalled in the Senate in January. Another House bill, Give States a Chance Act of 2015, was introduced November 2015 to allow governors to refuse the placement of Syrian refugees in their respective states if they certify they are not reasonably satisfied that the refugee does not pose a security threat. Under that bill, the governor could also refuse a refugee if he or she has not properly been informed of the intended sponsorship process for the refugee and if the governor determines that the proposed resettlement location is inappropriate because the proportion of refugees and comparable entrants in the area is too high. Thirteen Republicans co-sponsored the bill introduced by Rep. Ted S. Yoho, R-Fla. Its been referred to the House Subcommittee on Immigration and Border Security. This summer, Rep. Brian Babin (R-Texas) also introduced in the House the Resettlement Accountability National Security Prioritization Act of 2016, to suspend, and subsequently terminate, the admission of certain refugees. The bill is directed to nationals of Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Syria, and Yemen; or people who have no nationality and whose last habitual residence was in those specific countries. Forty-nine Republicans co-sponsored the bill, which would also evaluate the costs of benefits provided to refugees and their impact on national security. Babins bill to suspend admission of refugees sounds like what Priebus was talking about, said Steven Camarota, director of research at Center for Immigration Studies, a think tank favoring stricter immigration policies. Our ruling Priebus said, President-elect Trump's immigration policies are very similar to policies that are sitting right in the Senate and the House today, to temporarily suspend immigration from countries that harbor terrorism, to temporarily suspend immigration from Syria until we get better vetting. Trump's policies include ending sanctuary cities, deporting at least 2 million people and building a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border, not just restrictions on refugees. As for the restrictions, abill passed in the Housethat is designed to increase screening of potential refugees from Iraq and Syria. The bill also called for certifications that ensure potential refugees are not a threat to the security of the United States. But it has stalled in the Senate. Two otherHouse bills restricting the admission and resettlement of refugeeshave not been voted on either, so their outcome and support is still to be determined.",0.8,0.3,1.0,0.6,0.2,0.3,0.4,0.7,0.8,mostly-true

Final Rating: Mostly True  ","Traditionally, presidential candidates release their tax returns . . . Mitt Romney still wont.","More than one political opponent has attempted to make an issue of Mitt Romneys personal fortune.Romneys years leading the private equity firm Bain Capital — which sometimes made money by laying off workers and closing businesses it had acquired — have led to charges that he is a creature of Wall Street and disconnected from the lives of average Americans.According to the financial disclosure required of all presidential candidates by the Federal Election Commission, Romneys personal fortune is between $190 million and $250 million. All presidential aspirants are required to file Office of Government Ethics Form 278 with the Federal Election Commission.Details about Romneys wealth are scarce, however, because he is only required to fill out the standard disclosure form about his assets. And unlike some past and present presidential candidates, Romney has not released his income tax returns during this campaign or in previous races for state and federal office.Another GOP contender, Texas Gov. Rick Perry, has called on Romney to go beyond the legal requirements and release his tax returns. Perry released his own returns in October 2011.The Democratic National Committee raised the tax return issue in a video released earlier this month, What Is Mitt Romney Hiding?In it, the DNC makes the point that Romneys father, then-Michigan Gov. George Romney, released his tax returns during the 1968 primary campaign when he sought the Republican presidential nomination. George Romney put pressure on his opponents by releasing 12 years of income tax returns in November 1967.The DNC narrator states in the video: Traditionally, presidential candidates release their tax returns. ... Mitt Romney still wont.So, do presidential candidates really have a tradition of releasing their tax returns? And has Mitt Romney refused to do so?What constitutes a tradition?In the post-Watergate era, many, but not all, primary candidates have released their personal tax returns, in some cases going back decades. Here's a sampling of some recent elections, based on news coverage, publicly available returns and a list put together by Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, a group that promotes ethics and accountability. Presidents and vice presidents routinely release their returnsin office.2008 Tax returns were an issue in the 2008 primary campaign. Sen. Barack Obama went first, releasing returns dating back to 2000 in March 2008. Sen. Hillary Clinton waited until April to release tax records dating back to 2000 for herself and former President Bill Clinton. Sen. Chris Dodd, D-Conn., also released tax returns during the primary, but Joe Biden didnt release his returns until September, when Obama selected him as a running mate. John Edwards did not release tax returns, though he had released a decade of returns in September 2004, when he became John Kerrys running mate.Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., who eventually won the Republican nomination, released his individual tax returns in April. Cindy McCain, his wife, initially refused but then released summaries for 2006 and 2007.Romney declined to release returns, as did former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee and former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani, who both had released tax returns during earlier runs for state and municipal office.2004All the major Democratic contenders for the nomination released at least one year of tax returns, a list that included Kerry and Edwards, as well as Wesley Clark, Howard Dean, Richard Gephardt, Dennis Kucinich and Joseph Lieberman.2000George W. Bush largely cleared the GOP field early in the primary season. He and running mate Richard Cheney were the only Republicans to release returns. Vice President Al Gore and his chief rival for the Democratic nomination, then-U.S. Sen. Bill Bradley, of New Jersey, both released returns as well. Ralph Nader, whose third party candidacy played a crucial role in deciding the outcome of the general election, did not release his returns.1996Among GOP primary candidates in 1996, Sens. Bob Dole, Lamar Alexander and Jack Kemp released their tax returns. Publisher Steve Forbes, columnist Pat Buchanan and Sen. Richard Lugar did not.1992In April of that year, Bill Clinton released tax returns dating back to 1980. His closest rival for the nomination, former California governor Jerry Brown, did not.1988The top two Democrats in the race to face Vice President Bush, Michael Dukakis and Jesse Jackson, both released returns.1984The controversy over tax returns fell on the vice presidential candidates when Geraldine Ferraro and her husband, John Zaccaro, acquiesced to pressure and released their individual tax returns. After they did, the couple ended up paying more than $50,000 in back taxes.1980President Ronald Reagan, who like Romney had refused to release his tax returns during previous campaigns for state and federal office, relented in August and released his tax returns for 1979 after it became clear he was the likely nominee. Reagans chief rival for the 1980 nomination, George H.W. Bush, had released his in April, pressuring Reagan to do the same.1976Jimmy Carter and President Gerald Ford both released their 1975 tax returns and it was noted that an investment tax credit signed into law by Ford resulted in a significant tax windfall for a peanut warehouse owned by Carter.Is it true that Romney wont release his tax returns?Romneys camp did not respond to questions about if and when he would release his income tax returns. In response to the question when the Perry camp raised the issue, a Romney spokeswoman said the campaign would revisit the question during the next tax-filing season, presumably in April.Our RulingOf 34 presidential and vice presidential candidates reviewed above, only seven -- Brown, Buchanan, Huckabee, Forbes, Giuliani, Lugar, Nader -- declined to release personal tax returns.

Final Rating: Mostly True  ","In 99 percent of counties in America, someone making the minimum wage working full time cant afford a 1-bedroom apartment.","Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., has recently made it a point to support affordable housing, both in her social media posts and in the legislation she brings before Congress. On July 19, Harris introduced the Rent Relief Act to Congress, which would provide assistance in the form of a refundable tax credit to those who make under $100,000 a year and spend more than 30 percent of their income on housing. To rally support for the bill, she tweeted, In 99 percent of counties in America, someone making the minimum wage working full time cant afford a 1-bedroom apartment. She later posted a video that expressed a similar sentiment and repeated the statistic.  In 99% of counties in America, someone making the minimum wage working full time cant afford a 1-bedroom apartment. That is outrageous. I've just introduced the Rent Relief Act, so that Americans who spend over 30% of their income on rent can get a portion of that money back. We decided to look into Harriss statement. Aside from a few minor caveats, the statement is largely accurate. Out of reach? We began by reaching out to Harriss press secretary, who directed us to a 2017 study published by the National Low Income Housing Coalition titled Out of Reach. The study is updated yearly, and the 2018 edition is out. Harriss press secretary pointed out a line from the latest study that reads, In only 22 counties out of more than 3,000 counties nationwide can a full-time minimum wage worker afford a one-bedroom rental home at fair market rent. That statistic and the coalitions report overall have been cited by various news outlets. Do the math, and youll see that 22 divided by 3,000 comes out to a figure slightly smaller than 1 percent. That small percentage refers to the counties where a one-bedroom home is affordable for minimum-wage workers. But there are two concepts in the sentence from the study that require further clarification: affordability and fair market rent. The national coalition defines affordability as consistent with the federal standard that no more than 30 percent of a households gross income should be spent on rent and utilities. Thats the same guideline used by the Department of Housing and Urban Development, and we found its a standard threshold within the field. The definition of fair market rent is slightly different. It also has its origins from HUD. The National Low Income Housing Coalition defines it as typically the 40th percentile of gross rents for standard rental units. So that means that within any given metropolitan area, 40 percent of all rental properties are priced equal to or below the fair market rent threshold. That means not all units within the 99 percent of counties referred to in Harriss tweet are unaffordable for full-time minimum-wage workers, but it does mean that a majority — 60 percent — are. Of the remaining 40 percent of one-bedroom housing, some units may be affordable for those workers, but that doesnt mean theyll be quality apartments — they might be in a high-crime area or low-performing school district, for example. (We previously cleared up the definition of fair market rent in a fact-check of a Facebook graphic.) As Vincent Reina, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania School of Design, put it, It does not mean there are 0 affordable units (in the 99% of counties that Harris is referring to), it means that there are none affordable at or above the 40th percentile of the rent distribution. There are likely some units that are affordable, just not even close to enough.  The experts we reached out to pointed out that the conclusions reached by the National Low Income Housing Coalition are supported by other research, including a recent study published by the Joint Center of Housing Studies of Harvard University. Not all the studies would support the exact claim that 99 percent of counties in the U.S. are unaffordable, but theres a lot of evidence that the poorest families (say the bottom 20-25 percent) are financially stretched to afford unsubsidized housing, said Jenny Schuetz, a David M. Rubenstein Fellow in the Metropolitan Policy Program at the Brookings Institution. Our ruling Harris recently tweeted, In 99 percent of counties in America, someone making the minimum wage working full time cant afford a 1-bedroom apartment. She was referring to a recent study by the National Low Income Housing Coalition, which shows that in only 22 counties out of more than 3,000 counties nationwide can a full-time minimum wage worker afford a one-bedroom rental home at fair market rent. Harris didnt refer to the concept of fair market rent, which is defined as the 40th percentile of gross rents for standard rental units. The underlying study she referenced doesnt say that a minimum wage worker cant afford any housing in almost all of the United States, but that a minimum wage worker cant afford the average-priced housing unit. With that said, Harriss claim is still a largely accurate characterization of the magnitude of the rent affordability problems that many people face.

Final Rating: Mostly True  ",A strong majority of Americans support the Keystone XL pipeline.,"See editor's note below During the Republican response to President Barack Obamas 2015 State of the Union address, newly elected Sen. Joni Ernst of Iowa urged bipartisan cooperation to pass a longstanding agenda item for Republicans and some Democrats -- the Keystone XL pipeline. The project has been in the works since 2008, and its current version involves a 875-mile pipeline that would run from Morgan, Mont., to Steele City, Neb. Building this link would allow 830,000 barrels of oil per day to move from the tar sands fields in Alberta, Canada, to refineries on the Gulf Coast. Opponents of the pipeline say it will increase greenhouse gas emissions and increase the risk of water pollution from spills. Supporters speak of improved energy security and jobs, and blame the Obama administration for stalling what they consider critical infrastructure supported by many business leaders and labor unions. Heres what Ernst said during her State of the Union response on Jan. 20, 2015. The new Republican majority you elected started by reforming Congress to make it function again. And now, were working hard to pass the kind of serious job-creation ideas you deserve. One youve probably heard about is the Keystone jobs bill.  President Obama has been delaying this bipartisan infrastructure project for years, even though many members of his party, unions, and a strong majority of Americans support it. The Presidents own State Department has said Keystones construction could support thousands of jobs and pump billions into our economy, and do it with minimal environmental impact. We wondered whether Ernst was correct when she said that a strong majority of Americans support the pipeline. So we looked at the polling data. At the survey curation site pollingreport.com, we found five polls taken since May 2014 that asked questions that shed light on Ernsts claim. Well start with the four polls that asked the question in its most basic form -- whether the respondent favors or opposes construction of the pipeline: • CBS News, Jan. 9-12, 2015. Do you favor or oppose building the Keystone XL pipeline that would transport oil from Canada through the United States to refineries in Texas? Favor: 60 percent. Oppose: 28 percent. Unsure or no answer: 12 percent. (Margin of error ± 3 percent.) • USA Today/Princeton Survey Research Associates International, Nov. 13-16, 2014. Should Congress and President Obama approve construction of the Keystone XL pipeline that would transport oil from Canada's oil sands region through the Midwest to refineries in Texas, or not? Yes: 60 percent. No: 25 percent. Unsure: 14 percent. (Margin of error ± 3.6 percent.) • Pew Research Center, Nov. 6-9, 2014. Do you favor or oppose building the Keystone XL pipeline that would transport oil from Canada's oil sands region through the Midwest to refineries in Texas? Favor: 59 percent. Oppose: 31 percent. Unsure/refused: 10 percent. (Margin of error ± 3.1 percent.) • CBS News, May 16-19, 2014. Do you favor or oppose building the Keystone XL pipeline that would transport oil from Canada through the United States to refineries in Texas? Favor: 56 percent. Oppose: 28 percent. Unsure/No answer: 17 percent. For these four polls, support for the pipeline held steady in a very narrow band, from 56 percent to 60 percent. So Ernst has a strong case to make. The only caveat stems from the fifth poll, which asked the question in a somewhat different way. An ABC News/Washington Post poll taken between Jan. 12 and Jan. 15, 2015, phrased the question this way: Obama has said he won't decide whether to approve a new oil pipeline from Canada to Texas until a review has determined whether it is in the national interest. The Republicans in Congress are working on a law to authorize the pipeline without Obama's approval. Which side do you support? Should the pipeline be authorized now, or should the review be completed before deciding? Asked the question this way, respondents were less sanguine about the approach being taken by the Republican Congress of which Ernst is now part: 34 percent said the pipeline should be authorized without Obamas approval, while 61 percent said that the review should be completed first. (Another 2 percent said they opposed the pipeline outright, but that answer was only tallied when volunteered, not because it was given as an option.) In other words, the polls show strong and consistent public support for building the pipeline, but one poll suggests it's only after completing full reviews of its merits. Our ruling Ernst said that a strong majority of Americans support the Keystone XL pipeline. Shes right that between 56 percent and 60 percent of the public has consistently supported the project when asked outright whether it should be built. However, one poll found public concern about building it before reviews are complete -- a stance more in tune with Obama than with Republican leaders. EDITORS NOTE, Jan. 21, 2015: After this article appeared, a reader pointed out another poll that had addressed public support for the Keystone XL pipeline that had been released the same day we published the story. A NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll taken in January 2015 asked respondents whether they favored or opposed building the pipeline, or whether they did not know enough about this topic to have an opinion. The inclusion of that last phrase increased the dont know response beyond that found in most other polls, to 37 percent. Of those who did have an opinion, 41 percent favored building Keystone XL and 20 percent opposed it. Because that's generally in line with what we found in the other polls, our original rating of Mostly True stands.",1.0,0.0,1.0,0.8,0.0,0.0,0.5,1.0,0.8,mostly-true

Final Rating: Mostly True","Theres already 10,000 businesses that are not likely to open again, and a significant number of small businesses and minority businesses.","Arriving in face masks and sitting far apart from each other, Joe Biden and former President Barack Obama sat down for their first in-person meeting since the COVID-19 outbreak. A 15-minute video released by Bidens presidential campaign shows the two men venting about the current handling of the pandemic and reliving their accomplishments over eight years in the White House. They talked about health care access, the summers protests against racial inequality and police brutality, and the pandemics effect on American businesses. Theres already 10,000 businesses that are not likely to open again, Biden said, and a significant number of small businesses and minority businesses. The shuttering of 10,000 businesses over a few months is bleak enough. But Biden actually underestimated the pandemics toll — by a lot. The Biden campaign told PolitiFact that Biden intended to say 100,000 small businesses were lost, not 10,000. That tracks with a study by researchers at Harvard, the University of Illinois and the University of Chicago, which estimated that over 100,000 small businesses permanently shut down between early March and early May. The data does indicate that Black- and minority-owned businesses have suffered at significant rates. Economists told us its difficult to gauge which businesses closed for good, especially in the middle of an unyielding pandemic. Temporary closure and permanent closure are very different, said Tara Sinclair, an associate professor in economics and international affairs at George Washington University, and identifying the excess businesses that close due to COVID-19 can be tricky, particularly when focused on small businesses, because small businesses, especially young small businesses, frequently close. Only about two-thirds of businesses with employees survive at least two years, and only about half survive at least five years, according to the Small Business Administration. And thats without a pandemic. Bryan Stuart, an assistant professor of economics at George Washington University, said that while the 10,000 figure is likely a sizable underestimate, measuring closures, even without attempting to distinguish between whether they are permanent or temporary, is difficult. The research study that estimated 100,000 lost businesses was based on data collected from weekly surveys by Alignable, a network for small business owners. These surveys are valuable because they can be very timely, but an important limitation is that the survey frames, and the businesses within those frames that respond to surveys are usually not representative of all types of business across the U.S., Stuart said. Another estimate of closure announcements comes from Yelp, an advertising platform for local businesses. Yelp found that about 132,500 businesses closed between March 1 and July 10. Of those, Yelp says nearly 72,850 are believed to be permanent closures. One caveat with Yelps data is that it is not representative of all employers or all small businesses, Stuart said. The number of Black business owners plummeted from 1.1 million in February 2020 to 640,000 in April, according to a June 2020 report published by the National Bureau of Economic Research. The loss of 440,000 black business owners representing 41% of the previous level is disconcerting, wrote study author Robert W. Fairlie, an economics professor at the University of California Santa Cruz. The report, which was based on Census data, found that the shutdown disproportionately affected Black Americans, but also hit other minority businesses hard: Latino business owners fell by 32%, and Asian business owners dropped by 26%. The long-term effect could be problematic on several fronts, Fairlie wrote, worsening wealth inequality and the availability of local jobs. Stuart also referenced the NBER report, and said that among those who are self-employed, minorities have lost more work. The data indicates that COVID-19 is affecting a significant number of minority-owned businesses, he said, but doesnt tell us whether business closures are permanent or temporary. Biden said 10,000 businesses likely wont reopen due to COVID-19, and that the health crisis is significantly affecting small and minority-owned businesses. Thats true, although the problem is substantially worse than he described. Bidens campaign said he intended to say 100,000 businesses, a figure that lines up with recent research. Biden is right that Black and minority-owned small businesses have been disproportionately affected by the economic crisis brought on by the pandemic, according to census data research. Bidens claim is accurate — 10,000 businesses are certainly unlikely to reopen — but the caveat is a lot more businesses will also likely close.",0.7,0.3,1.0,0.5,0.2,0.1,0.4,1.0,0.6,mostly-true

Final Rating: Mostly True  ",The Convention Center was sold as a building that would never cost taxpayers a dime.,"State Rep. Patricia Morgan of late has repeatedly criticized the states financial support for the Rhode Island Convention Center Authority, asserting that the entity has cost taxpayers more than $450 million, even though it was never supposed to cost them a dime. Last week, the West Warwick Republican, who represents a group calling itself the Republican Policy Group, convened a press conference and unveiled an investigative report on the subsidies, which totaled more than $30 million last year. This included $23 million for debt service. Seriously, Morgan said, it was sold as a building that would never cost taxpayers a dime and it continues to cost us money. Year after year, state budgets show, in addition to paying off the convention centers debt -- its mortgage, so to speak -- the taxpayers have kicked in subsidies to keep the authority afloat. Since 1994, the state has allocated in excess of $450 million to the authority, which runs the Dunkin Donuts Center and Veterans Memorial Auditorium in addition to the convention center. Thats a big number and it made us wonder: Did someone really say this facility would never cost taxpayers a dime? If so, what were they talking about? So we asked Morgan for her sources. We also searched through The Journals archives and found someone who had made just such a statement -- Richard M. Oster. Oster, the heir of a family metals enterprise, had risen to the loftiest heights of the business world, serving as the chairman of the London-based Cookson Group PLC, a multinational company. In 1987, then-Gov. Edward DiPrete installed Oster as chairman of the Rhode Island Convention Center Authority. This made him the front man in 1989 for the campaign to sell the public on the need for a convention center, which was expected to cost $225 million. It was to be one of the largest economic development projects in Rhode Islands history. Oster told The Journal such a facility would bring 500,000 visitors a year to the city, pump $60 million to $100 million per year into the economy and generate enough new tax revenue -- via hotel, income, sales and property taxes -- to offset the deficit from construction and operations. This wont cost the taxpayers one dime, Oster said in 1989. That was his clincher, the line he used after detailing a list of economic benefits.  Morgan told us this was the quote she had in mind in her attack on the convention centers finances. Morgan, however, did not talk about how Oster and the other proponents claimed that new tax revenue would make up for the taxpayers costs. Morgans repeated emphasis on costs without discussing new tax revenues drew criticism from Joseph R. Paolino Jr., the former mayor and another champion of the convention center. I think shes wrong, Paolino said. I dont think she truly understands the concept of the convention center and what a convention center is supposed to do for a community. Paolino, who refers to the late Oster as one of the leading business giants of our community, says any analysis of convention center appropriations must consider tax revenue generated by convention center activity. This is the real story, he says. He acknowledged that he doesnt know how Osters projections worked out. But last week the Authority said its experts calculate that the convention center, the Dunkin Donuts Center and Veterans Memorial Auditorium have an average annual impact totaling $135 million and generate $10 million in state and local tax revenue across about 500 events — hockey games, conferences and musical performances among them. Thats the opposing point of view. Is it credible?  We turned to Gary Sasse, who headed up the Rhode Island Public Expenditure Council in the 1980s and is now director of the Hassenfeld Institute for Public Leadership at Bryant University. Sasse, who supported the project in 1989, says he believes the presence of the convention center has had some degree of multiplier effect on the local economy -- possibly enough to offset costs. But Sasse emphasizes that the actual numbers are important for this debate and there is no independent entity around to do the hard work of providing a trustworthy assessment.  Who is the independent scorekeeper? he asks. Thats the problem. Our ruling Morgan had her numbers right. And Richard Oster did famously tell the public that the center wasnt going to cost the taxpayers a dime. But she failed to put Osters claim in context. Oster didnt say convention center revenues would pay its bills. He was talking about the centers overall economic impact. And, as Gary Sasse says, without an independent scorekeeper, we wont know whether the centers impact offsets its costs.

Final Rating: Mostly True  ",Says Donald Trump games the U.S. visa system so he can hire temporary foreign workers at low wages.,"Former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg portrayed Donald Trump as a hypocrite on immigration in a speech at the Democratic National Convention. While Trump wants to deport millions of undocumented immigrants, he also uses the system to his advantage to hire foreigners, Bloomberg said in his endorsement of Hillary Clinton July 27, 2016. Trump games the U.S. visa system so he can hire temporary foreign workers at low wages, Bloomberg said. While the accusation that Trump games the system is tough language, the real estate tycoon has hired temporary foreign workers to fill typically low-wage jobs at his properties. We will explain how he did it. H-2B visas We couldnt reach a spokesman for Bloomberg, however, its likely he was referring to Trump hiring foreign workers at his Mar-A-Lago Club, an exclusive eating club in a mansion in Palm Beach County, Florida. Texas Sen. Ted Cruz made a similar attack during the primary. The club has sought H-2B visas for low-skilled, low-wage workers such as cooks, wait staff and housekeepers. H-2B visas are legal — Congress has set the cap at 66,000 per year — and its agricultural counterpart is the H-2A visa. The vast majority of the workers on these two visas programs nationwide are young Mexican men, although news reports say Trump sought workers from Europe. Employers argue they need these temporary workers to fill jobs Americans dont want, while critics say the workers can be exploited. Since the visas are tied to a particular job, the foreigners cant simply jump ship for a better paying job at another resort. The worker is paid based on the prevailing wage or minimum wage. Since 2010, nearly 300 U.S. residents applied or were referred for jobs at Mar-A-Lago, but only 17 were hired, the New York Times reported in February. Meanwhile, Mar-A-Lago sought more than 500 visas for foreign workers. (The visas were also sought at some of his other properties.) We dont know how many people actually used the visas and became employees. To obtain the visas, businesses must prove they were unsuccessful at filling positions with Americans or legal residents. According to the Florida Department of Economic Opportunity, the resort posted jobs through CareerSource Florida, the local workforce development boards throughout the state. A U.S. Labor Department spokesman told PolitiFact Florida previously that 93 people applied for 250 seasonal job openings at the resort. Four were hired, while 79 didnt answer interview requests or turned down jobs (10 applications were classified with unknown status). Documents the resort later filed with the Labor Department showed that many of the American applicants werent hired because they didnt meet requirements. Some applicants didnt want to work split shifts, lacked experience, wanted full-time jobs instead of part time, or didnt respond when the resort contacted them. After that process, the Labor Department certified 685 H-2B visas for the Mar-A-Lago Club between 2008 and 2015. The New York Times asked Trump why he hired so many foreign workers when Americans applied for the same positions. The only reason they wouldnt get a callback is that they werent qualified, for some reason, Trump replied. There are very few qualified people during the high season in the area. But some experts question Trumps assessment that its hard to find local help. In 2015, CareerSource assisted in placing nearly 1,800 candidates in hospitality jobs in Palm Beach County. But Mar-A-Lago didnt show much interest in using the free service. Tom Veenstra, senior director of support services at CareerSource in Palm Beach County, told PolitiFact Florida that the first time his office received a request for helping finding workers was September 2015. (That was shortly after one of the first news reports, by Reuters, about Trumps foreign hiring practices.) Since that time, Mar-A-Lago used the office to hire just one person, a banquet server. We called the HR director after the hire, and she said they were pleased with the hire and the candidates we sent them, Veenstra said. There has been nothing else since then. So is Trump gaming the system? Gabriel Jack Chin, a professor at University of California Davis School of Law, said many of these companies say they cant find American workers but only put in minimal effort. One answer is yes, this is gaming the system, but everybody does it, in the sense that the labor certification standards are widely thought to be evaded in the way that Mar-A-Lago has done in the past, Chin said. Trump spokesman Stephen Miller referred us to Trumps reply during the March 10 debate in Miami when he defended the use of these visas. I'm a businessman, Trump said. These are laws. These are regulations. These are rules. We're allowed to do it. And frankly, because of the devaluations that other countries -- the monetary devaluations that other countries are constantly doing and brilliantly doing against us, it's very, very hard for our companies in this country, in our country, to compete. So I will take advantage of it; they're the laws. But I'm the one that knows how to change it. Nobody else on this dais knows how to change it like I do, believe me. Miller said that Trump has opposed legislation to expand the visa program and pledged to reform visa programs to protect American workers.  Our ruling Bloomberg says Trump games the U.S. visa system so he can hire temporary foreign workers at low wages. Trump sought visas for hundreds of foreign workers to fill temporary positions at his Mar-A-Lago Club in Florida in recent years. Hundreds of U.S. applicants either applied or were referred for the jobs, but only a handful were hired. There is some debate about whether those applicants were qualified or not. Trump has used a legal program to obtain workers with H-2B visas. Saying he games the system is harsh language, and an expert says the process used by Trump is common.",1.0,0.5,1.0,0.7,0.5,0.5,0.3,1.0,0.7,mostly-true

Final Rating: Mostly True  ","Over the past two years, Florida has cut more than $1 billion in taxes.","Despite lawmakers virtually ignoring his budget wish list during the 2016 legislative session, Gov. Rick Scott is boasting about fulfilling a campaign promise to cut taxes by $1 billion in his second term. Scott took credit for the fiscal feat both before and after signing the Legislatures wide-ranging tax-cut package, HB 7099. Over the past two years, Florida has cut more than $1 billion in taxes, an April 13, 2016, press release from the governors office read. Scott had pledged to hit the billion-dollar mark in tax reductions during his successful 2014 re-election campaign, mostly by giving breaks to businesses and limiting property tax growth. In his March 15 press release announcing his intention to sign the Legislatures budget, Scott said hed kept his promise with $1.2 billion in tax cuts over the first two years of his second term. Scott has repeated this claim several times in one form or another. But have taxes really gone down by more than $1 billion in two years, like he says? It depends on how you look at what the Legislature has done, but the changes havent happened the way Scott wanted. Tallying the taxes When we asked Scotts office to break down their budget math for us, they pointed to a chart in their March 15 press release, without further detail:  We were able to verify the figures from Scotts office based on changes passed by the Legislature the last two years. The Florida Office of Economic and Demographic Research compiles an annual list of how much tax revenue will be affected by bills passed during that years legislative session (these can change as the fiscal picture becomes clearer). The House also analyzed HB 7099 to estimate how much the bill would change tax receipts. Cell phone & TV tax cut: In 2015, the Legislature passed a 1.73 percentage point reduction in the states communications services tax, a charge on consumer cell phone, cable and satellite bills. That amounted to a $21 annual reduction on a $100 monthly cell phone and cable bill. Scott had wanted to cut the tax by $120 million, something wed rated a Promise Kept on our Scott-O-Meter.  Property tax reduction: This one is tricky, because its more of a tax shift than a tax cut. Scott also is taking credit for a solution he didnt want. During the 2016 session, the House and Senate agreed to increase per-pupil education spending for K-12 students, something Scott had wanted. Scott initially wanted the bump in education funding paid almost entirely through higher local property tax collections, not with general revenue. (Scott had previously proposed limiting property tax increases with a constitutional amendment, a campaign promise he has so far ignored.) Higher property values meant that collections would increase whether lawmakers raised the key millage rate for local property tax dollars for schools or kept it the same. Instead, the Legislature cut the local rate and paid for the $428 million difference they needed with general tax revenue. Legislators mostly referred to this as tax relief, and not a tax cut. Weve rated a similar statement Mostly True, because the change altered future collections, instead of cutting current collections. Property owners, however, are still shielded from a tax hike. Senate Appropriations Chairman Tom Lee, R-Brandon, told the Tampa Bay Times that if you include this revenue swap, Scott technically had reached $1 billion in tax cuts. But thats dependent on Scott accepting a plan he opposed. The Legislature has to revisit education funding every year, too, so this will no doubt change. Back to school sales tax holiday: Scott counts these breaks from sales tax on school supplies as a cut. These arent permanent cuts, because the Legislature has to approve whether there will be sales tax holidays each year. His figures do jibe with state estimates. The totals are different, in part, because the 2015 holiday was 10 days long, while the 2016 holiday will only be three days long. The terms of exempt items also differs between the two years. Manufacturing machinery and equipment: Getting rid of this tax was another Scott promise, going back to his first term. The sales tax originally was cut back with a limited exemption in 2012, but the following year was suspended by legislators for three years. Starting in 2014, the tax would not apply through April 30, 2017. Scott pushed to make the suspension permanent and in 2016, the Legislature agreed. The Scott-O-Meter rated this a Promise Kept. College textbooks: Scott proposed making college textbooks exempt from sales tax, suggesting it would save the average student about $60 per year. The Legislature agreed to the exemption for the 2015-16 fiscal year, but it was not renewed in the 2016 session. Other tax cuts: Scotts office did not include specific dollar figures for other tax breaks, fee changes and provisions that went down over the last two years. In 2015, the Legislature removed sales taxes on gun club membership fees, put a $60,000 cap on taxes for board repairs, and gave businesses tax credits for pollution cleanup and research, among other measures. For 2016, legislators gave veterans organizations an exemption on food and drink sales taxes, phased out an asphalt tax over three years for government projects, and tinkered with taxes on cruise ship alcohol and tobacco sales, pear cider, and aviation fuel, among other changes. Thats just a sample of the tax changes over the last two years that Scotts office counted. The figures are in the ballpark and add up somewhere north of $1 billion. Whether he can take credit for the total is a tougher question. Experts have told us that counting on things like tax credits and sales tax holidays means consumers have to spend money first before enjoying any benefits. Many of these changes also are temporary or narrowly focused. And remember that local governments may have to raise taxes to account for a change in revenue. Meanwhile, the Legislature has balked at several tax changes Scott has wanted, including eliminating the states corporate income tax — a major Scott request in 2016 that would have cost the state $770 million annually — and phasing out the sales tax on commercial leases. Our ruling Scott said, Over the past two years, Florida has cut more than $1 billion in taxes. The figures are pretty accurate compared to state estimates for tax changes during 2015 and 2016. But theres some question whether you can really consider all of the measures tax cuts. While some of the alterations are permanent, many of them are temporary exemptions or target very specific beneficiaries. Scott also has to ignore some of his earlier proposals and count a plan for education funding that is the opposite of what he wanted to top the $1 billion mark. The statement is accurate but needs some clarification.",0.8,0.3,1.0,0.5,0.0,0.4,0.6,1.0,0.6,mostly-true

Final Rating: Mostly True  ",We see a quarter-billion dollars in a pension fund that needs to be funded at $1.2 billion.,"Providence Mayor Angel Taveras had to deal with near bankruptcy in the capital city after he took office in 2011. As the city struggled to fix its budget problems, he won union concessions to reduce pension costs. But critics question how far the pension deal negotiated by Taveras, now a candidate for governor, went to fix the problem. The most recent figures released last month show the plan is only 31.4-percent funded. Republican mayoral candidate Daniel Harrop raised the issue during the Dec. 15, 2013, edition of WPRI's Newsmakers program. Asked why he wants to run again, he said the city needs a mayor who will stay around to solve the city's long-term problems and not have aspirations for higher office, like Taveras and his predecessor, David Cicilline, now a member of Congress. We see a quarter billion dollars in a pension fund that needs to be funded at $1.2 billion, Harrop said. That would mean that the city, at the time, had a pension system that was only 20 percent funded. (The U.S. Government Accountability Office says public pension plans should be at least 80 percent funded.) First, we need to explain why we're ruling on a seemingly-straightforward statement two months after it was made. We began work on this item in December but getting up-to-date numbers about the city's pension fund turned out to be maddeningly difficult. The city was often slow to respond and listed different amounts in different reports over different time frames. We decided to wait for the completion of the latest estimate of the city's accrued liability, in part because the city has refused to release an earlier actuary report for the year ending June 30, 2012, citing a dispute over its accuracy. Finally, a week ago, the city released the latest actuarial report, for the year ending June 30, 2013, allowing us to proceed. So lets go back to December, when Harrop made his statement. At that point, we asked Harrop about his figures. He cited two blog postings on the Providence pension system from reporter Ted Nesi of WPRI.com. One, published Oct. 30, reported that the fund had $283 million in assets on Oct. 22. The other, published Dec. 7, said the fund had a liability of almost $1.2 billion. Harrop also cited a 2011 city report saying the liability as of June 30, 2010, was $1.256 billion, with assets of $316 million. We don't know the precise status of the pension system the day Harrop made his statement. But now that we have the up-to-date financial reports, we do have a snapshot of what the system's assets and liabilities were as of June 30, 2013. According to that latest actuary report, released Jan. 31, 2014, on June 30 the city needed $1.2 billion to cover its current and future pension obligations. On that point, Harrop turns out to have been right on the money. At the same time, according to both the actuary report and the city's latest annual financial report, released about a month after Harrop made his statement, the Providence pension fund had $336 million in investments and other assets, a lot more than what Harrop stated. The amount in the city's investment account was $247 million. In addition, there was $3 million in cash and $59 million the city paid into the fund that year. Finally, the report counted as an asset $26 million owed to the fund from loans made to people in the retirement system at a rate of 9.25 percent, according to David Ortiz, spokesman for Mayor Taveras. Add all those together and you get the $336 million. In Harrops defense, at the time he made his statement, up-to-date data on the citys pension obligations were not available. The city was withholding it as part of an ongoing dispute with its actuary, Buck Consultants, who the city accused of making fundamental and inexcusable errors in its 2012 pension calculations. This year Providence used a different firm, Segal Consulting. Our ruling In December, Daniel Harrop said, We see a quarter billion dollars in a pension fund that needs to be funded at $1.2 billion. Harrop was citing numbers from different sources and different years, and those numbers are moving targets. They all support his underlying point: Providence's pension program is woefully underfunded, even with recent concessions negotiated with the city's unions. Based on the latest report of the city's actuary, which was not available at the time Harrop made his statement, the candidate was correct on his $1.2 billion figure. At the same time, there was significantly more than a quarter billion dollars set aside in the city's coffers for pension costs. But the number he cited accurately reflected the approximate amount the city had in its investment portfolio.

Final Rating: Mostly True  ",Says Bill OReilly spoke 40 percent of the words in an interview with President Barack Obama.,"At least among Fox News viewers, nothing boosts audience like taking President Barack Obama to task. The day after Fox News host Bill OReilly had an interview with Obama, OReilly picked up an additional 1 million viewers for his show The OReilly Factor. The president sat down with OReilly right before the Super Bowl, and the tone of the conversation itself stirred up a flurry of reactions. Heres a small example from a moment when OReilly pressed Obama on the administrations response to the attack on the American compound in Benghazi, Libya. OReilly: If (Ambassador to the United Nations) Susan Rice goes out and tells the world that it was a spontaneous demonstration... Obama: Bill... OReilly: -- off a videotape but your... Obama: Bill... OReilly: -- your commanders and the secretary of Defense know it's a terror attack... Obama: Now, Bill... OReilly: Just... Obama: -- Bill... OReilly: -- as an American... Obama: -- Bill -- Bill... OReilly: -- I'm just confused. Obama: And I'm -- and I'm trying to explain it to (you), if you want to listen. No wonder that many observers described the interview as testy. Washington Post columnist Dana Milbank called it the roughest and nastiest exchange of the three times that OReilly has interviewed Obama. He interrupted the president 42 times in 10 minutes, Milbank said on MSNBCs Politics Nation. Of all the words uttered in this 10-minute interview, 40 percent were uttered by OReilly. We wanted to check Milbanks numbers. Not on the interruptions, but on the word count. We pulled out our digital centrifuge and separated the OReilly and Obama utterances. According to our research, OReilly delivered 787 words to Obamas 1,484. This gave OReilly 35 percent of the conversation. Thats a little lower than Milbank said but more or less in the same ballpark. We reached out to Milbank and did not hear back. To satisfy our own curiosity, we decided to compare this with another one-on-one interview between the president and a journalist. A couple of days before Obama sat down with OReilly, he did the same with CNNs Jake Tapper. We subjected that transcript to the same rigorous methods and found that Tapper spoke 23 percent of the time, leaving the president the other 77 percent. The precise word counts were Tapper -- 849 and Obama -- 2,886. Milbanks point was that OReillys interview was almost as much about OReilly as it was about the president. We dont know about that, but we can say that OReilly spoke about 50 percent morethan Tapper did in his interview. The topics in the two interviews differed greatly. OReilly brought up Obamacare, the Benghazi attack and the IRS scrutiny of conservative groups seeking tax-exempt status. Tapper focused on issues like immigration reform, legalization of marijuana, spying by the National Security Agency, and security at the Winter Olympics in Sochi. OReilly had a second installment of his time with Obama that aired the night after the Super Bowl. Milbanks comment came on the same night, so were counting only the segment that had aired publicly at that point. For the record, in the second installment, OReilly asked the president about African-American children raised in single-parent households, school vouchers, the Keystone pipeline, a contraceptive coverage exemption for Little Sisters of the Poor, and veterans benefits. Our ruling Milbank said OReilly said 40 percent of the words during his interview with the president. That was a little high. By our count, 35 percent would be more accurate. OReilly spoke decidedly more than Tapper did in his time with Obama.",0.7,0.2,1.0,0.7,0.0,0.1,0.3,1.0,0.8,mostly-true

Final Rating: Mostly True  ","The R.I. Turnpike and Bridge Authority was supposed to exist only until the bonds used to build the Newport Bridge were paid off through tolls. Once the bonds were paid, the Newport Bridge was to be transferred to the State of Rhode Island and become toll-free.","One of the most contentious issues of 2013, at least among residents of the eastern half of Rhode Island, is the question of whether there should be a toll on the new Sakonnet River Bridge. In an Aug. 14, 2013, commentary in The Providence Journal, Steven Frias, a lawyer and the state's Republican National Committeeman, argued that Rhode Island should use the revenue from its gasoline tax and motor vehicle fees exclusively to maintain its bridges and roads. We were intrigued by this statement: When the Rhode Island Turnpike and Bridge Authority was first created in 1954, it was supposed to exist only until the bonds used to build the Newport Bridge were paid off through tolls. Once the bonds were paid, the Newport Bridge was to be transferred to the State of Rhode Island and become toll-free. The state has always charged a toll on that span, now officially known as the Pell Bridge. We were curious about the accuracy of Frias' characterization. When we contacted Frias, he sent us 34 pages from Chapter 3390, the 1954 act creating the authority. It authorized the construction of the Newport Bridge, the acquisition of the Jamestown Bridge, and the construction of a turnpike for the bridge that could run from Connecticut, through Washington County to the Massachusetts border. It also gave the authority the right to finance, maintain, repair and operate any of those projects, along with the ability to issue new bonds and collect tolls of any amount at any and all points along the project. The law is silent about ending tolls on the Newport Bridge, which opened June 28, 1969, although Section 17 dictates that No tolls shall be charged for traffic over the Jamestown Bridge after December 31, 1970. On that date, the Jamestown Bridge, which has since been replaced, was to become property of the state, without any money being owed on it. Frias, asked about his statement, focused on that section, which also says that once the authority has paid off all its bonds or set aside enough money to cover those bonds, all other projects financed under the provisions of this act shall be transferred to the state in good condition and repair, and thereupon the authority shall be dissolved . . .  So the law did call for eventually turning everything, including the Newport Bridge, over to the state. But, once again, there is no mention of ending any other tolls. In fact, the law doesn't specifically dictate that the Newport Bridge have a toll. The authority has continued to exist to maintain the bridge, now 44 years old. RITBA chairman David Darlington said the authority currently has about $50 million in bonds that remain to be paid off, and that indebtedness is expected to continue because the state doesn't have the funds to take over and maintain the bridge. (The current bonds mature in 2017.) Frias said his statement is correct because the original legislation makes it clear that the intent was to eventually transfer ownership of the Newport Bridge to the state. The bridge would then have to be toll free, he argued, because the state, at the time, had not given itself the authority to levy tolls on roadways. This is inherent in the law, he said. An intent to transfer ownership of a bridge to an entity that has no legal authority to impose tolls, at the time the legislation was first enacted, is an intent to make that bridge a toll-free (bridge). That strikes us as a stretch, especially when the law specifically talks about transferring the Jamestown Bridge to the state and making it toll free. If the act of transference automatically meant that no tolls could be charged, as Frias asserts, there would be no need to mention ending the Jamestown bridge toll.  We also checked with Thomas Evans, the state librarian, who pointed out that the act creating the Mount Hope Bridge Authority, also passed in 1954, also contains language that calls for the project to be turn over to the state AND be toll free after Dec. 31, 1969. (East Bay residents will note that the bridge subsequently carried a toll until 1998.) Frias was not dissuaded. He said it was necessary to specify a date for the Jamestown and Mount Hope bridges to become toll-free because, unlike the Newport Bridge, they were in existence in 1954. It makes no sense that the Newport Bridge would have a toll on it once it was transferred over to the state, he said. The state had not given itself legal authority to impose a toll in 1954 (nor has it since then) therefore a bridge owned by the State is synonymous with a bridge that cannot have a toll. Legal interpretations aside, it seems that the public perception at that time was that the Newport Bridge toll would go away eventually. Frias produced a copy of an article in the March 11, 1963, edition of The Evening Bulletin, headlined Newporters Pressing for Span. Part of it reports on arguments of the bridge advocates, saying, And when the new bridge finally was paid for, they add, the state would come into ownership of a valuable property, a toll-free bridge across the East Passage. Darlington said that when he was appointed to the RITBA board in 2002, My dad said, 'Those tolls were supposed to come off that bridge when it was paid for. It has to be well paid for by now. Go down and get those tolls taken off that bridge.' Then, when you find out what it costs to maintain the bridges, the state doesn't have anything like the money that's required, Darlington said. It's so enormous, and you have to focus on them year after year because if you let a bridge go three, four, or five years, you have to start planning a new bridge. So it's really not practical. Our ruling Steven Frias said that When the Rhode Island Turnpike and Bridge Authority was first created in 1954, it was supposed to exist only until the bonds used to build the Newport Bridge were paid off through tolls. Once the bonds were paid, the Newport Bridge was to be transferred to the State of Rhode Island and become toll-free. The first sentence accurately characterizes the 1954 legislation. The big question is whether the bridge was supposed to eventually be toll-free. Despite what the public believed and Frias is inferring, there was no mandate in the 1954 legislation to end tolls on the Newport Bridge once the state took ownership. Perhaps other historians have additional evidence that will cause us to rethink our ruling. But for now, while most of Frias' statement is true, the key element regarding tolls on the Newport Bridge is open to serious question. For that reason, we rule it Mostly True.

Final Rating: Mostly True  ","If you look at the three people on the (debate) stage from the United States Senate, all three of them have a combined two bills that became law that they've sponsored.","Three senators running for the Republican presidential nomination have slim records in Congress, said former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush. On NBCs Meet the Press Nov. 1, Bush said that he, on the other hand, got to be governor of a state and accomplish big things. This is about public service, about solving problems. If you look at the three people on the stage from the United States Senate, all three of them have a combined two bills that became law that they've sponsored. If you look at Hillary Clinton, in 10 years, three bills she sponsored that became law. This is the gridlock that I'm running to try to break up. We wondered if Bush was right that the three sitting senators he debated against Oct. 28-- Rand Paul, R-Ky., Marco Rubio, R-Fla. and Ted Cruz, R-Texas -- have only had a combined two bills become law so far.(Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., is also a sitting senator running for the Republican nomination, but Bush did not include Graham in his count, as he appeared in an earlier debate for candidates with the lowest poll numbers.) (In March, we looked into Cruzs track record, and we looked at Clintons in June.) We evaluated Cruz, Rubio and Pauls legislative records using Congressional Quarterlys BillTrack database and GovTracks advanced legislation search. We found that Bushs statement is accurate in that the three senators have sponsored just two bills that eventually became law. But the claim leaves out some important context, such as outside factors working against the senators and the fact that this is an incomplete measure of a senators impact in Congress. Put another way, its unclear how much you should read into what Bush said. Serving since 2013, Cruz has been the primary sponsor on 57 bills, one of which has become law. Rubio and Paul both joined the Senate in 2011. Rubio has sponsored 106 bills, and President Barack Obama signed one of them into law. Paul has sponsored 141 bills but none has yet to become law. Cruzs bill, enacted in 2014, denied admission to the United States any United Nations representative who poses a national security threat (a response to Irans chosen U.N. representative). The bill was uncontroversial and passed unanimously in both the Senate and the House. Obama signed Rubios bill in 2015. This law, which authorized the State Department to support womens rights in developing countries, was also uncontroversial and passed both chambers unanimously. All three also have their names on laws as cosponsors: Cruz has three, Rubio has 18and Paul has four. The caveats to Bushs claim So its true that Cruz, Rubio and Paul havent had many of their ideas signed into law. But there are several caveats to Bushs claims. Seniority matters. Cruz has only been in Congress for 2.5 years; Paul and Rubio have been there for 4.5. In 2014, National Journal analyzed which senators have sponsored or cosponsored the most bills that eventually became law and found that the longer a senator had been in office, the more bills they passed. Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, has passed more than 740 bills and has been in the Senate since 1977. At the time of National Journals report, the median was 78 bills passed and belonged to Sen. David Vitter, R-La., who has been a senator since 2005. Whos in control matters. Until this year, Republicans were the minority party in the Senate, putting Cruz, Rubio and Paul at a disadvantage. Its expected that the majority leader will schedule bills for his own party more frequently than for the minority, said Joshua Huder, senior fellow at Georgetown Universitys Government Affairs Institute. Even within their own party, more junior members priorities are at the back of the line. First-term senators have a lot of headwinds, particularly when in the minority, Huder told PolitiFact when we wrote about Cruzs record back in March. That said, the Senates design allows for individual members to make a difference, even if theyre not in the majority, said Sarah Binder, senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and an expert in legislative politics. They make a difference in ways other than just passing laws. They can sponsor amendments to bills, for example, or their bills can get absorbed into broad omnibus legislation. Cruz successfully sponsored an amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act that will give Purple Hearts to those killed or wounded in the shooting at Fort Hood in Texas in 2009. They can also use their platform to shape the national conversation, such as Pauls efforts to raise awareness of privacy issues and National Security Agency surveillance of citizens' phone and other records. Or, they can put a plug in the opposing partys agenda, like when Cruz spearheaded efforts to block presidential appointments to push his priorities. That's not quite the same as shepherding a bill into law, but it's an example of the ways in which merely counting bills enacted gives short shrift to other ways in which senators can make a difference, Binder said. Effectiveness outside of sponsorship. Another problem with simply counting the number of bills passed is that it doesnt account for individual bills political salience. Binder noted that Rubio played a major role in crafting the 2013 Gang of Eight immigration reform bill, and even though that bill did not become law, it was an important piece of legislation that continues to be relevant. And the Senate is only one-third of the lawmaking process (the other parts being the House and the president), so many factors that go into passing a law is out of the sponsors hands, Huder said. A Cruz spokesperson told us that his impact in Congress is demonstrated through more actions than just the number of laws passed.We also reached out to the campaigns forRubio and Paul, and we'll update this post if we hear back. Looking at Clinton, Sanders Because Bush mentioned her, we wanted to briefly touch on Clintons record, too. Serving as the Democratic senator from New York for eight years (not 10, as Bush said), 2001 through January 2009, Clinton sponsored 416 bills, and three became law. She also co-sponsored 74 bills that were eventually enacted into law. Theres one more senator running for president: Bernie Sanders, I-Vt. Of the 190 bills Sanders has sponsored since joining the Senate in 2007, two have become law. He has cosponsored 33 that were enacted. Our ruling Bush said that the three Republican senators running for president have a combined two bills that became law that they've sponsored. Bush has his numbers right: Of all the bills Cruz, Rubio and Paul have sponsored combined, only two bills have been signed into law. But experts told us that this isnt a great measurement of a legislators effectiveness, and there are other ways to show impact in Congress. All three senators have their fingerprints on numerous laws as cosponsors or amendment authors. Editor's note: This post has been updated to include a response from the Cruz campaign that we received after publishing the article and to clarify the senators identified by Bush in his claim.

Final Rating: Mostly True",There's not a major bill I know with Hillary's name on it.,"Before he bowed out of the race, Sen. Joe Biden dismissed the legislative accomplishments of three Democratic primary rivals with whom he served. Biden was particularly direct summing up Clinton's tenure, saying, There's not a major bill I know with Hillary's name on it. In some ways, Biden's assessment is correct: Clinton has not been the lead sponsor of legislation dealing with a major national issue that made its way to President Bush's desk. But New York's junior senator has had comparatively few opportunities after spending four of her seven years in the chamber as a member of the minority. Instead, she has worked the way many senators do, introducing bills that wind up getting included in another's initiative, drafting a Senate companion bill to a popular House initiative or working with home state Republicans to send money to New York or protect local interests. After eight years as first lady, Clinton deliberately sought a lower profile in the Senate, respecting the seniority system and tending to steer away from contentious national debates such as health care. She also has adopted moderate — some would say carefully calibrated — rhetoric on abortion, the war in Iraq, fiscal policy and social issues. The approach surprised many of her critics, who suspected she would stake out more liberal positions and primarily use New York and the Senate as a stepping stone for her national ambitions. She was the leading Democratic sponsor of a 2003 law that gave the Food and Drug Administration the power to order drug companies to test their drugs to determine the proper dosages for children. The effort was inspired by cases in which children died or were injured taking drugs or using medical devices shown safe for adults. She worked with South Carolina Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham in 2006 to get portions of legislation she authored to extend health coverage to National Guard troops and reservists included in a fiscal 2007 defense authorization bill. After the Sept. 11 attacks, Clinton authored a companion bill to House legislation ensuring that public safety officers killed or injured in the line of duty during the attacks would receive expedited payment of benefits. On another matter closely related to her home state, Clinton worked with Republican congressman Tom Reynolds to keep the Niagara Falls Air Reserve Station open at a time when the Pentagon was closing bases — a move that saved 800 jobs. Clinton has effectively used her senatorial power to influence a handful of issues and to focus on local politics. Biden is correct when he says her name is not on a major bill, but as Biden knows better than most, that's not a fair measure of a legislator's accomplishments. We rule his statement Mostly True.

Final Rating: Mostly True  ",A clear majority of Americans support removing the cost-sharing requirement for prescription contraceptive coverage.,"U.S. Rep. Rush Holt says the federal mandate requiring most health care plans to offer free contraceptive coverage makes sense.And he claims a majority of Americans agree with him.Fierce debate on the issue erupted when guidelines issued by the U.S. Health and Human Services Department that required insurance plans to cover birth control as preventive services, without co-pays or deductibles, were made final without exemptions for some employers with religious affiliations. On Feb. 10, President Barack Obama announced a compromise: if a religious-affiliated employer objected to providing contraceptive coverage, the responsibility would fall on the insurance company.In a Feb. 24 e-mail newsletter explaining his support for Obamas decision, Holt (D- 12th Dist.) said: Nearly all American women, including women of faith, have used contraception sometimes, and a clear majority of Americans support removing the cost-sharing requirement for prescription contraceptive coverage.Our colleagues at PolitiFact national recently ruled on a claim that addressed the first half of Holts statement. A White House official said: Most women, including 98 percent of Catholic women, have used contraception. That claim earned a Mostly True.With the birth control plan still under fierce scrutiny, we questioned Holts other claim. Despite all the rancor, do Americans favor the plan?Holts spokesman, Thomas Seay, pointed to a February health tracking poll from the Kaiser Family Foundation that found that 63 percent of respondents support the new federal requirement that private health insurance plans cover the cost of birth control and 33 percent oppose it. The margin of error was 3 percentage points.But thats just one poll of 1,519 adults. We found seven other surveys that asked respondents about their views on requiring health care plans to cover birth control. Five support Holts claim.A CBS News/New York Times poll found an even larger majority of Americans -- 66 percent -- support the plan requiring private health insurance plans to cover the full cost of birth control. About a quarter of respondents opposed the plan, with a margin of error of 3 percentage points. When asked specifically about the same requirement for employers with religious affiliations, support decreased slightly, with 61 percent in favor and 31 percent opposed.A recent Fox News poll found 61 percent of respondents supported requiring employer health plans to cover birth control for women and 34 percent opposed. The poll had a margin of error of 3 percentage points.A survey by the Democratic firm Public Policy Polling conducted on behalf of Planned Parenthood and a poll by the Public Religion Research Institute both found majorities in support of employers providing health care plans that would cover the cost of birth control.Another poll conducted for NBC News and the Wall Street Journal found 53 percent of respondents favored the requirement and 33 percent opposed it, with a margin of error of 3.5 percentage points. Thats a majority, but one that could possibly be affected by the margin of error.Two of the polls we reviewed found opposition to providing free birth control coverage.A Quinnipiac University poll with a margin of error of 1.9 percentage points found a split of 47 percent in support of requiring private employers to offer free birth control coverage and 48 percent opposed.A poll conducted by Rasmussen Reports -- widely considered Republican-leaning -- found 46 percent opposed the plan and 43 percent supported it. The survey had a margin of error of 3 percentage points.Our rulingHolt said a clear majority of Americans support removing the cost-sharing requirement for prescription contraceptive coverage.We found eight polls that recently asked respondents whether they supported or opposed requiring health care plans to cover the cost of birth control.In six of those surveys there was majority support, only one of which could be impacted by a margin of error. Two others polls showed more opposition than support. Still, Holts claim is backed by most of the polls we reviewed.Overall, this claim is Mostly True.

Final Rating: Mostly True  ","If you look at last year's presidential campaign, you can't find a mention of public option.","Democrats hoping to pass health care legislation through the Senate need 60 votes to begin consideration of the bill and, ultimately, to pass it. That means every Democrat and the two independents who generally vote with them need to approve.One of those independents is Sen. Joe Lieberman of Connecticut. Lieberman favors health care reform but opposes the public option. Hetold Politicothat he was keeping all my options open when it comes to votes on health care.He said the public option has only recently become a key part of Democratic plans for a health care overhaul.It's classic politics of our time that if you look at the campaign last year, presidential, you can't find a mention of public option, Lieberman said. It was added after the election as a part of what we normally consider health insurance reform — insurance market reforms, cover people, cover people who are not covered.Politico pointed out, correctly, that Lieberman was wrong about the public option being added after the election. It was part of Obama's plans released publicly during the campaign.But we wanted to check his statement that during the 2008 presidential election, you can't find a mention of public option.Here at PolitiFact, we covered the Democratic primaries and examined the candidates' plans for health care reform in great detail. The most contentious issue during the primary was support for what is known as the individual mandate -- the requirement that everyone have health insurance or face a tax penalty. We don't recall any significant discussion of a public option, nor did we do any Truth-O-Meter items on it during the campaign.To make sure we weren't missing anything, we conducted a database search of campaign coverage by all news outlets. We found very few news reports during the campaign that mentioned the public option or a public plan as part of Obama's health proposals, with the notable exception of aNew York Timesstory published on May 30, 2007, headlined, Obamacalls for wider and less costlyhealthcare coverage.Here's what theTimesreported:Mr. Obama would create a public plan for individuals who cannot obtain group coverage through their employers or the existing government programs, like Medicaid or the State Childrens Health Insurance Program. Children would be required to have health insurance. Subsidies would be available for those who need help with the cost of coverage.He would also create a National Health Insurance Exchange, a regulated marketplace of competing private health plans intended to give individuals other, more affordable options for coverage. The public plan would compete in that Insurance Exchange, advisers said.The Obama campaign mentioned the public option briefly in its health position paper and on its Web site. A typical description went like this:The Obama-Biden plan will create a National Health Insurance Exchange to help individuals purchase new affordable health care options if they are uninsured or want new health insurance. Through the Exchange, any American will have the opportunity to enroll in the new public plan or an approved private plan, and income-based sliding scale tax credits will be provided for people and families who need it. ... The Exchange will require that all the plans offered are at least as generous as the new public plan and meet the same standards for quality and efficiency.But there was little discussion about the public option. The debate in both the primary and the general election focused on the mandate, costs and covering the uninsured. We found the public option mentioned in only 70 articles or transcripts during the entire campaign and months prior to the inauguration.It wasn't until after Obama took office that there was sustained attention to the issue. There were 50 items published between January and May and then coverage exploded this past summer. Major newspapers produced about 650 significant stories or op-eds on Obama and the public option in June, July and August.Lieberman was wrong that the public option was added after the election, but he makes a valid point that it wasn't emphasized or discussed much during the campaign. Lieberman said, It's classic politics of our time that if you look at the campaign last year, presidential, you can't find a mention of public option. We found a few mentions, but the public option was not at all a significant point of debate during the presidential campaign.",0.6,0.5,1.0,0.5,0.0,0.4,0.5,0.8,0.7,mostly-true

Final Rating: Mostly True  ",California has seen a 56 percent decline in the gun murder rate since the 1990s.,"California voters added to what are considered the nations strongest gun control laws on Election Day by approving Proposition 63. The measure imposes background checks on ammunition sales; bans possession of large-capacity ammunition magazines; and forces owners to give up their weapons as soon as they can no longer legally possess them. Lt. Governor Gavin Newsom, who is running for governor in 2018, helped author the initiative and led the campaign for it. The measure had received nearly 63 percent approval as of mid-November, with some votes still uncounted. In a press conference the day after Prop 63 passed, Newsom made several claims about the effectiveness of Californias gun restrictions. We have significantly reduced the gun-murder rate because of our progressive gun policy, Newsom said, adding that California has seen a 56 percent decline in the gun murder rate since we started to step up and step in and lead the nation in common sense gun safety laws, background checks, restricting large-capacity clips and the like.  Gavin Newsom makes his claim about California's gun murder rate at about the 6:30 minute mark in the video above. We decided to focus on Newsoms claim that California has seen a 56 percent decline in the gun murder rate since it began imposing tough gun laws in the 1990s. Whether those gun laws are the driving force behind such a drop is a matter of mixed opinion. Gun rights groups say tougher criminal penalties, not gun laws, have led to the decline. PolitiFact does not fact-check predictions or opinions.

(AP Photo/Cliff Owen) Our research The gun murder rate measures the number of gun-related homicides per 100,000 residents in a geographical area. A separate measurement, the gun death rate, takes a broader look including homicides, suicides and accidental shooting deaths. Based on our research and contact with Newsoms campaign spokesman, it appears the lieutenant governor mixed up the two rates and ended up understating the drop in Californias gun murder rate by more than 10 percentage points. The states gun death rate -- not the gun murder rate -- dropped 56 percent from 1993 to 2013, according to figures provided by Ari Freilich, an attorney at the San Francisco-based Law Center for Gun Violence Prevention. The attorney cited age-adjusted data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The nonprofit law center advocates for gun control laws and is considered an authority on gun crime statistics. The law centers figures do not include data from 2014, a year in which gun deaths and gun homicides continued to fall in California. Nor do they include statistics from 2015 and 2016, which are not yet available. Still, the 20-year span is the approximate period during which California imposed strict new gun laws, spurred by mass shootings years earlier on a Stockton schoolyard and inside a San Francisco law office. This meant the rate of deaths by any kind of shooting declined from 17.48 per 100,000 residents in 1993 to 7.68 per 100,000 residents. Larger drop in gun murder rate During this same period, Californias gun murder rate declined even faster: By 65 percent, according to a review of the CDCs fatal injury reports by PolitiFact California. If 2014 is included, the rate dropped by 67 percent. Data from these reports have been cited by both gun control and gun rights groups to describe Californias decline in gun violence. They show gun murders fell from 9.60 per 100,000 residents in 1993 to 3.14 per 100,000 in 2014. In raw numbers, this means nearly 2,000 fewer people in California died in gun homicides in 2014 (when 1,233 were killed) compared with 1993(when 3,183were killed). Nationwide, the gun murder rate fell 45 percent during much of the same period. Between 1993 and 2000, it dropped from 7.0 homicides to 3.8 homicides per 100,000 people, according to a Pew Research analysis in 2015 of available federal data. Since then, Pew reported, the rate has remained relatively flat. Our ruling California Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom said California has seen a 56 percent decline in the gun murder rate since it enacted strong gun control laws in the 1990s. Newsom appears to have mixed up the gun murder rate with the gun death rate. Californias gun murder rate dropped 67 percent between 1993 and 2014, according to a review of fatal injury report data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. A similar, though somewhat smaller, drop in the gun murder rate took place nationwide during this period. Newsoms overall point is correct: Gun deaths, including gun homicides, have dropped significantly in California since the state imposed the new laws.  We are not fact-checking the cause of this drop. Gun rights and gun control groups have different opinions on this. What is clear is that gun homicides have declined significantly, and even faster than what Newsom stated. His claim needs this key clarification. MOSTLY TRUE– The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information.

Final Rating: Mostly True  ",Gov. Romney's plan would cut taxes for the folks at the very top.,"After a flurry of attack ads in the past two weeks, President Barack Obama this week released a TV ad in which he spoke directly into the camera and discussed how his policy approaches differed from Mitt Romneys. He cited taxes as one area where they had different philosophies. Obama said, Gov. Romney's plan would cut taxes for the folks at the very top.Well check whether this is an accurate characterization of Romneys plan.Romney has posted some key elements of his tax plan on his campaign website. Heres a summary of the provisions for individual taxpayers:• Cut marginal rates by one-fifth on a permanent, across-the-board basis• Eliminate interest, dividend, and capital gains taxes for taxpayers with an adjusted gross income below $200,000• Eliminate the estate tax• Repeal the Alternative Minimum TaxTo analyze the Romney tax cut, we turned to the Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center, an independent think tank that evaluates the tax proposals submitted by presidential candidates. The Tax Policy Center looked at two versions of Romneys tax proposal. We will use the analysis of the more recent of Romneys two plans, which the group published in March 2012.The Tax Policy Center ran two sets of numbers, one that gives Romney credit for extending the tax cuts enacted under President George W. Bush and for an annual adjustment in the Alternative Minimum Tax and one that doesn't. Under the analysis that gives Romney credit for extending the Bush tax cuts and the AMT, people in each of the 11 income ranges in the centers study saw a tax cut, with after-tax income increasing by anywhere from 0.3 percent for people who earn less than $10,000 to 19.8 percent for people earning more than $1 million per year. Under the other measurement, which we find is more appropriate, people in eight of the 11 income ranges got cuts -- all except the income ranges below $30,000. For those earning more than that, after-tax income would increase by anywhere from 0.8 percent for those in the $30,000 to $40,000 range to nearly 12 percent for those earning more than $1 million.So Obama is telling part of the story. Yes, there are substantial benefits for people at the top, but he ignores that most people in the middle and lower reaches of the income ladder would benefit as well. Using the calculation that does not give him credit for the Bush and AMT extensions, people earning from $40,000 to $50,000 would see a cut of $512 on average, while taxpayers in the $50,000-to-$75,000 range would see a cut of $1,122.Still, there is support for Obama's point because the Romney tax cuts are tilted toward the wealthy. The biggest winners under Romneys tax plan are those earning more than $1 million. That group accounts for less than 1 percent of all taxpayers, but would receive 26 to 31 percent of the Romney plans tax benefits, according to the Tax Policy Center's calculations.Our ruling Obama is correct that Romneys plan does indeed cut taxes for high-income Americans -- quite heavily in fact -- but the rich arent the only ones who would see a cut. Taxes would be reduced in lower income ranges, too. Still, the plan gives a large share of the benefits to higher income taxpayers.",1.0,0.2,1.0,0.8,0.0,0.3,0.4,1.0,0.7,mostly-true

Final Rating: Mostly True  ","Austin has over 1,000 city employees that make six-figure salaries.","UPDATE 6:15 p.m., Sept. 26, 2014: We revised the story below to note that at a Sept. 23, 2014, forum Wiley said almost 1,000 workers have six-figure salaries. This additional information, pointed out by a reader, didn't change our rating of the claim we checked. Rich rich rich! City of Austin employees strike it rich! Sorry. We got carried away by a claim at a forum for Austin City Council candidates thrown by the League of Women Voters and the City of Austin. According to an Austin American-Statesman news story posted online Sept. 16, 2014, a council candidate, lawyer Jay Wiley, said the day before theres room in the city budget to staff offices in each of the 10 newly created single-member districts. Wiley, running in District 6 in Northwest Austin, also said at the forum: Weve got, actually, over 1,000 city employees that make six-figure salaries. Does that add up? We failed to reach Wiley to learn the origin of his figure. Meantime, city spokeswoman Melissa Alvarado emailed a chart indicating that as of Sept. 1, 2014, 879 workers earned from $100,089 to $304,657. To follow-up queries, Alvarado sent a chart listing 24 vacancies at that time for positions paying $100,000 or more. So, you could say the city had 903 positions paying six figures at the time Wiley spoke. Alvarado said the city then had 11,852 workers, which means its $100,000-plus earners accounted for 7 percent of its workers. Plus, more workers were heading into the six-figure class shortly. To our inquiry, Alvarado said 3.5 percent raises taking effect Sept. 21, 2014, (before the start of the new fiscal year in October) would result in 1,162 employees earning $100,000 or more. At that time, she said, the city expected there to be another 36 open positions paying more than $100,000 each. So at that time, the city projects, 1,198 positions will pay six figures. Alvarado said the city had 12,780 positions budgeted for fiscal 2015. We also looked at which city workers make the most. Peruse that sampling below.

Final Rating: Mostly True  ",Seven presidents before (Barack Obama) -- Republicans and Democrats -- tried to expand health care to all Americans.,"President Barack Obamas health care law has been one of the most polarizing aspects of his presidency, with Republicans criticizing it at every turn. But the keynote speaker at the Democratic National Convention in Charlotte, N.C., San Antonio Mayor Julian Castro, didnt run from it. He applauded Obama for pursuing expanded health care -- and succeeding where his predecessors had failed. Seven presidents before him -- Republicans and Democrats -- tried to expand health care to all Americans, Castro said. President Obama got it done. We wondered whether Castros history was correct. So we checked with a variety of public policy and health care historians and found that Castros in the ballpark -- but that a lot of caveats are in order. Lets start with the presidents who almost certainly fit Castros definition of having tried to expand health care to all Americans. • Harry Truman. On Nov. 19, 1945, Truman wrote a message to Congress saying that the health of American children, like their education, should be recognized as a definite public responsibility. According to the Truman Library, the most controversial aspect of the plan was the proposed national health insurance plan. It called for the creation of a national health insurance fund to be run by the federal government. This fund would be open to all Americans, but would remain optional. Participants would pay monthly fees into the plan, which would cover the cost of any and all medical expenses that arose in a time of need. The government would pay for the cost of services rendered by any doctor who chose to join the program. The American Medical Association attacked the plan, characterizing the bill as socialized medicine. Truman ultimately abandoned the effort after the outbreak of the Korean War • Richard Nixon. In 1971 and 1974, Nixon offered separate proposals to expand health insurance to all, or nearly all, Americans. Generally speaking, they involved employer mandates to provide health insurance, supplemented by subsidies for poorer Americans. I shall propose a sweeping new program that will assure comprehensive health-insurance protection to millions of Americans who cannot now obtain it or afford it, with vastly improved protection against catastrophic illnesses, he said in 1974. The 1974 effort gained some traction in Congress but faltered as Nixon became consumed by scandal. Had it not been for his destruction as a result of the Watergate affair, legislation might well have passed during his presidency, said Princeton University health care historian Paul Starr, the author of Remedy and Reaction: The Peculiar American Struggle over Health Care Reform. • Bill Clinton. In 1993 and 1994, Clinton -- in a process spearheaded by First Lady Hillary Clinton -- sought to pass a major overhaul of the health care system that would have aimed for universal coverage. Even though the Democrats controlled Congress at the time, the plan did not win enactment. So thats an easy three. It isnt much of a stretch to get a fourth: • Lyndon Johnson. Technically, Johnson never sought full universal health care. But it seems churlish to deny inclusion on this list to the man who signed Medicare and Medicaid into law. They arent universal care for everybody, but they are universal care for large subsets of the population. You can add a few more if you lower the bar a bit. • John F. Kennedy. Kennedy voiced strong support for legislation that would ultimately become Medicare. On May 20, 1962, he held a televised rally to push the proposal at a packed Madison Square Garden in New York City. (The American Journal of Public Health later noted that hours later, the AMA rented the empty hall to film a rebuttal by its president, without showing the empty seats.) But he died before the legislation could come to fruition.) • Gerald Ford. Ford endorsed Nixons second proposal, but it didnt get far on his brief watch. • Jimmy Carter. Carter proposed a step-by-step plan to achieve universal coverage, Starr said. It came relatively late in his first term, and it was too weak to satisfy (Democratic Sen.) Ted Kennedy and many other Democrats. Carters efforts were halfhearted, said Brown University political scientist James Morone, co-author of The Heart of Power: Health and Politics in the Oval Office from Roosevelt to Bush. You can actually add a couple more if you bend Castros definition even further. • Theodore Roosevelt. He did endorse the idea of expanding health insurance to all, but only as as a presidential candidate for the Bull Moose Party in 1912, not during his earlier term in the White House. • Franklin D. Roosevelt. In his State of the Union address in 1943, Roosevelt called for a social insurance system that would extend from the cradle to the grave, and he was preparing a program and a speech on national health insurance at the time of his death. In the midst of World War II, Roosevelt never pursued it in earnest, but Truman took up the mantle instead • Dwight Eisenhower. Eisenhower reacted to Democratic proposals for single-payer health care by proposing an expansion of care within the model of private-sector medicine. Eisenhowers approach was to make permanent the tax break for employer-sponsored health coverage (which remains today) in order to encourage as many Americans as possible to get covered through their workplace. For those who were not employed, Eisenhower proposed that the government reinsure private insurance companies to encourage them to add less profitable populations to their coverage rolls. While Morone calls the Eisenhower plan relatively timid, it nonetheless sparked the AMAs opposition, which helped kill it in Congress. The remaining Republican presidents did act to expand health coverage in certain ways, but none of our experts thought they met Castros definition of pushing for universal health care. • Ronald Reagan signed the Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act, which requires hospitals to serve patients in urgent need, and the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act, or COBRA, which allows individuals to keep paying for coverage if they lose their insurance. In addition, with almost no support from his own cabinet, Reagan added catastrophic care to Medicare toward the end of his presidency, though the provision was later repealed. • George H.W. Bush, worried about the Democrats getting traction with health care in a 1991 Senate special election, sent a plan to congress. Bush didn't like the issue, but he had a really good health team that put together a pretty good republican proposal, Morone said. • George W. Bush pushed for and signed the expansion of Medicare to include prescription drug coverage. Putting it all together, you could cut the number to five or raise it to eight depending on how strictly you want to interpret Castros words, Starr said. Our ruling Castro said that seven presidents before (Obama) -- Republicans and Democrats -- tried to expand health care to all Americans. Its a slam dunk getting to three or four presidents, and its possible to reach seven presidents, but to do that requires a looser interpretation of expanding coverage to all Americans.",0.7,0.5,1.0,0.6,0.0,0.3,0.5,1.0,0.8,mostly-true

Final Rating: Mostly True","Says for the coronavirus, the death rate in Texas, per capita of 29 million people, we're one of the lowest in the country.","During a March coronavirus briefing, Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick said the state has one of the lowest coronavirus death rates in the country — a trend he said he hopes will continue through April. If you look at the death rate in Texas, per capita of 29 million people, we're one of the lowest in the country, he said. But we need to continue that for the rest of April. And even be better at that. The first issue here is that Patrick is conflating two calculations in his statement: the death rate for the coronavirus and the number of coronavirus deaths per capita in Texas. The death rate of a particular illness or disease is calculated by dividing the number of fatalities by the number of confirmed cases of the illness. A geographys total population isnt a factor. It is possible to look at the number of coronavirus deaths per capita, but it says less about the danger posed by the virus than the death rate. To give Patrick a fair shake, well take a look at both of these figures and how Texas compares to other states. Patrick did not return a request for comment seeking clarification on his statement. The death rate is generally a function of the number of people infected, said Dr. Myron Cohen, director of the Institute for Global Health and Infectious Diseases at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, in an email. We are often unsure of this because this depends on sampling, and the tests deployed. For this reason, well also look at the number of tests administered by each state. As more tests are administered and more cases are identified, the death rate for the virus will change. Given that the number of cases and fatalities is constantly changing, this fact-check will use data from March 31 — the day Patrick made his statement. Along these lines, it is important to remember that the death rate at this point in time is just a snapshot. Case fatality rates are not constant. They can change considerably during an epidemic if, for example, it is discovered that there are many more milder cases than originally thought, according to a statement from the World Health Organization to PolitiFact at the end of March. The WHO also noted that the rate may vary across different geographies due to demographic factors, for example differences in the age structure of the population. End of March numbers At the time of Patricks remarks, there were 3,266 confirmed cases of the coronavirus in Texas and 41 related deaths reported by state health authorities. This puts the approximate death rate for the virus at 1.26%, meaning 1.26% of people who tested positive for the virus died. Looking at all 50 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico, Texas is among the areas with the lowest coronavirus death rate. Eleven states had a lower death rate when Patrick made his statement, including several with just one death: Wisconsin (1.18%), Missouri (1.06%), Tennessee (1.03%), South Dakota (0.93%), New Hampshire, (0.82%), West Virginia (0.62%), Utah (0.56%), North Carolina (0.53%), Hawaii (0.47%) and Wyoming, which had reported zero coronavirus deaths on the last day of March. It appears that Texas is among the states with low coronavirus deaths, but that is still true of large portions of the U.S. at this point, said Dr. Dhitinut Ratnapradipa, an environmental health professor at Sam Houston State University. At the time of Patricks claim, 29 states had a death rate of less than 2%. The state with the highest death rate on March 31 was Louisiana, with about 5,237 confirmed coronavirus cases and 239 deaths, a rate of 4.56%. Patricks statement also referenced deaths per capita of 29 million people in Texas. Texas is among the states with the fewest deaths per capita, based on March 31 coronavirus data and 2018 1-year population estimates from the Census Bureaus American Communities Survey. When Patrick spoke, there had been fewer than one coronavirus death for every 100,000 people in Texas. The state with the most deaths per capita at the time was New York, with about eight deaths per 100,000 people. But Texas is also among the states that have administered the fewest number of coronavirus tests per capita. At the time of Patricks statement, Texas had administered 42,992 coronavirus tests — about 150 per 100,000 people. New York had administered about 1,050 tests per 100,000 people, or 205,186 tests in total. The number of confirmed cases is directly related to testing, Ratnapradipa said in an email. There is likely widespread community infection of people with no or mild symptoms who are not being tested. This means that we cannot accurately calculate a COVID-19 fatality rate. Cohen said it is important to remember that the current pandemic is dynamic and growing, worldwide and that declaring any kind of victory over the virus is probably a bad idea at this point in time for most places on the planet. Since Patrick made this claim, the number of coronavirus-related deaths in the state has almost doubled, the state confirmed more than 1,000 additional cases and administered more than 10,000 additional tests. Our ruling Patrick said looking at the coronavirus death rate in Texas, per capita of 29 million people, we're one of the lowest in the country. Patricks statement equates the death rate for coronavirus and the number of coronavirus deaths per capita in Texas, two different calculations. It is true that, at the time of Patricks statement, Texas was among the states with the lowest coronavirus death rate (and those with lowest number of deaths per capita) — but not by much. There were 29 states with a death rate of less than 2%. Experts cautioned that the actual coronavirus death rate cannot be accurately calculated until more people have been tested — and Texas is among the states with the lowest number of tests administered per capita. Patricks comparison is accurate based on the information available at the time of his statement, but his claim needs clarification and is missing important context about testing.",0.8,0.5,1.0,0.7,0.0,0.3,0.5,0.9,0.6,mostly-true

Final Rating: Mostly True  ","North Carolina during this pandemic had among the lowest COVID-related deaths, as well as job losses per capita.","Gov. Roy Cooper says that, compared to other states, North Carolina has done an exceptional job of preventing job losses and COVID-19 deaths during the pandemic. His comments came during an Aug. 4 press conference after a state official offered an update on North Carolinas rental assistance program. Thanks to you and your team for the hard work, he said. Several months ago, an analysis showed that in states across the country, North Carolina during this pandemic had among the lowest COVID-related deaths, as well as job losses per capita. In a difficult year and amid too much pain, saving lives and jobs has been a point of pride for our state. It shows we follow the science to protect peoples lives without losing sight of their livelihoods. Cooper was referring to an analysis by the research firm Hamilton Place Strategies, according to spokesman Ford Porter. The study, published in April, examined statistics from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the U.S. Department of Labor to compare job losses and COVID-19 deaths in each state. A chart accompanying the study shows North Carolina as one of only a few states where both death and job loss rates were well below the national average, though by the time Cooper spoke in August, those stats were a little outdated. We wondered: How do North Carolinas COVID-19 death and job loss numbers compare to other states as of August? It turns out that North Carolinas numbers are still relatively low. Data compiled by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control shows the number of deaths in each state, as well as the rate of death per 100,000 people. To see what the data looked like on the day of Coopers press conference, we used the Wayback Machine at Archive.org. On Aug. 4, the CDCs most recent data was from Aug. 3. Heres what it showed. Death rate: North Carolina had a lower death rate than the national average, which was 184 deaths per 100,000 people on Aug. 3 and its rate of 130 deaths per 100,000 people ranked 12th-lowest in the country on that date. Only Idaho (123), Colorado (120), Nebraska (117), New Hampshire (102), Washington (80), Utah (76), Oregon (67), Maine (66), Alaska (52), Vermont (40) and Hawaii (37) had lower rates as of Aug. 3. As of Aug. 19, North Carolinas rate was 133 deaths per 100,000 people, still the 12th-lowest in the country. David Wohl, a physician who studies infectious diseases at the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill, says it makes sense to judge a states responsiveness by looking at deaths per capita. He said low rates are influenced by a multitude of factors, from access to care to the general health of the population. NC does have a robust healthcare infrastructure with many local medical facilities and major regional tertiary care centers, Wohl told PolitiFact NC in an email. Testing for COVID-19 has been widely available, leading to potential earlier diagnosis. The state has been very active in administering monoclonal antibody treatment and I suspect we are doing better at this than many other states, possibly preventing progression to more serious disease. North Carolinas unemployment rate is tracked by both the states commerce department and the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. North Carolinas unemployment rate was 3.6% in February 2020, hit a pandemic high of 12.9% in April 2020, and fell to 4.4% in July. In July, 20 states had lower unemployment rates than North Carolina. When Cooper spoke on Aug. 4, the latest unemployment data available was from June. At that time, 21 states had lower unemployment rates than North Carolina. But unemployment rates, which are based on household surveys, dont alone provide a clear picture of each states employment level, says Michael Ettlinger, founding director of the University of New Hampshires Carsey School of Public Policy. There are many otherwise employable people who want employment but who are not out actively looking for jobs because their industry hasnt come back enough to make it worthwhile, Ettlinger said. With variations among states in people starting to seek jobs, differences in the unemployment rate between states can be as much because of those variations as actual job creation. Ettlinger and Jordan Hensley, a policy analyst in his department, recently published a study that examined how many jobs each state lost and recovered during the pandemic. According to their study, North Carolina lost 2.7% of its jobs between February 2020 and June 2021, equal to about 124,000 positions. That percentage is tied for the 10th-lowest among the states, Ettlinger said. Unemployment data released just hours before this fact check reinforce the idea that North Carolinas economy is recovering faster than other states. The latest data show that North Carolina lost only 1% of its jobs between last February and this July, the sixth-lowest percentage in the country. A variety of factors might influence job gains, Ettlinger said. Weather, early COVID-19 rates, current COVID-19 rates, the type of businesses in each state, pre-existing employment trends, and a certain degree of randomness may all play a role in employment levels, he said. Mike Walden, an economist at N.C. State University, says the state may have benefitted from its mix of industries. Sectors like technology, financial services, and education — particularly higher education — largely continued operating. Also, agriculture and agribusiness were deemed necessary and continued their work, Walden told PolitiFact NC in an email.Cooper appointed Walden to a business group that met with him virtually every two weeks. He said Cooper and others in state government worked with and listened to the business community for advice on managing both the economic and health issues of the pandemic. Still, if I was asked prior to the pandemic if NC would have performed so relatively well, I would not have necessarily predicted these very positive results, he said. Cooper said North Carolina during this pandemic had among the lowest COVID-related deaths, as well as job losses per capita. North Carolina was 12th from the bottom among states in the coronavirus death rate, and an analysis by the University of New Hampshire shows that North Carolinas job losses during the pandemic were the 10th lowest among the states. These are not the absolute lowest rates nationally, but both measures can reasonably be described as being relatively low.",1.0,0.0,1.0,0.8,0.0,0.0,0.4,0.9,0.9,mostly-true

Final Rating: Mostly True  ",Income disparities in the United States are the worst since the 1920s.,"U.S. Rep. Bobby Scott voted against a sweeping trade in agreement with Asian nations earlier this month, in part because he thinks it will depress U.S. wages.  Entering into another large-scale trade deal at a time when income disparities in the United States are the worst since the 1920s is not the best course of action for our nation, Scott said in a June 12 statement explaining his votes against the Trans-Pacific Partnership.  We wondered if pay inequality between the very top earners and the rest of workers really is the highest since the Roaring 20s. Similar claims have been sounded this year from both sides of the political aisle and uttered by two presidential candidates who, otherwise, are light years apart: Sens. Bernie Sanders, I-Vermont, and Ted Cruz, R-Texas.  Scotts office backed the claim by referring us to two reports. The first, published earlier this year by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, is a guide to statistical studies on income inequality published by other organizations, including the U.S. Census Bureau and the Congressional Budget Office. All of the studies showed that disparity in the U.S. has been climbing steadily since the 1970s. But there was a problem: most of research didnt go back much further in time and to get to the bottom of Scotts claim, we had to travel back nearly 100 years.  One such time machine exists and the second document referred directly to it. Research by Emmanuel Saez -- an economist at the University of California, Berkeley and recipient of a 2010 genius grant from the MacArthur Foundation -- traces U.S. pay disparity since 1913. Saez and other economists built a database that compiles historic disparity statistics from 30 nations using data from millions of individual tax returns filed over the years.  In 2012, the top 1 percent of U.S. earners made 18.88 percent of the total pre-tax income of the nations tax filers. That was the highwater mark since 1928, when top earners pulled in a record 19.6 percent of all income.  Saez says the 2012 share may have been a slight aberration, in part because many high earners cashed investments to avoid an increase in the capital gains tax that took effect the following year.  In 2013, the top percents share of income was 17.54 percent of total earnings. While that was a slight decrease, it still was the 16th highest mark over the 101 years measured in data base. Its also the latest year available.  The data shows the top earners had at least a 16.68 percent share of total income every year since 2005. The figure was exceeded only one time between 1928 and 2005 -- top earners pulled in 17.64 percent in 1936..  The 16 years in which the top 1 percent had the greatest share of U.S. income are: While Saezs work has become a popular source for politicians to cite when discussing income disparity, some economists are critical of his measurements.  Gary Burtless, an economist with Brookings, a Washington think tank, told us as well as PolitiFact Texas that Saezs data understates income growth of the bottom 99 percent. He noted that Saezs income data is limited to pre-tax private income including wages, self-employment earnings, dividends, interest, rental payments and, in some cases, capital gains.  Whats missing, Burtless said, are other forms of income such as Social Security, unemployment benefits, food stamps, government reimbursement of medical bills and untaxed fringe benefits such as employer contributions to health and retirement plans.  These unmeasured benefits, which almost entirely began in the 1940s -- and, in some cases, decades later -- are far more important for low and middle-income Americans than they are for the very well-to-do, Burtless said.  The CBO, which has been measuring income disparity since 1979, uses a broader statistical formula than Saez. It computed the top 1 percents income at 13.3 percent in 2009 and 14.9 percent in 2010 -- the latest years available. Saez, in comparison, computed the disparity at 16.7 percent and 17.5 percent for the same two years -- an average of about 3 percentage points higher than the CBO.  Average income disparity during the 1930s was less than two percentage points below the average from 2010-2013. So if all forms of income were computed for each era, its possible that that the actual disparity was greater 1930s than it is today.  Our ruling  Scott said, Income disparities in the United States are the worst since the 1920s.  The one database that goes back that far backs up Scott. It shows that, with one exception, the sixteen highest years of disparity between the top one percent of earners and others occurred before 1930 or after 2004.  But its worth noting that the data tends to understate income because it doesnt consider major government and employee benefits that werent offered until the 1940s or later. So its very possible thatbottom-line disparity would have been greater in the 1930s than it is today.",0.7,0.3,1.0,0.6,0.2,0.4,0.5,0.8,0.4,mostly-true

Final Rating: Mostly True  ",Wages are on the rise — in fact we were the top small-business wage growth state in the nation.,"During his recent election announcement for governor of Missouri, Mike Parson trumpeted a strong economy in the state, taking particular care to highlight increases in small-business wages. With record lows in unemployment, more people are going back to work in Missouri, Parson said Sept. 8. Wages are on the rise — in fact we were the top small-business wage growth state in the nation. Does the governors comment check out? We wanted to investigate. A spokesperson for Parsons campaign cited an April 2019 article from St. Louis Business Journal that used numbers from an April 2019 report from Paychex/IHS Market Small Business Employment Watch to show Missouri ranked first in the country in hourly wage growth for small businesses. At $25.55 per hour, Missouri small business wages were up 3.48%, or 86 cents, that month. The Show-Me State finished first ahead of California, New York, Arizona and Illinois in small-business wage growth. According to the Small Business Employment Watchs September report, Missouri now ranks third in the country in hourly wage growth increase at 3.38% (New York is second at 3.53% and Illinois is first at 4.11%). If assessing for weekly wage growth rise, Missouri is second at 3.83%. Illinois comes in at 3.84%, just .01% better than Missouri. Overall, Missouri has been a top-five small business wage growth state (by weekly earnings) every month this year, according to Paychexs analysis. So what is Paychex, and how does it calculate its data for the Small Business Employment Watch? Paychex is a human resources and payroll company with over 600,000 clients nationwide. According to a media spokesperson for the company, it uses up-to-date, aggregated payroll data from approximately 350,000 of Paychex's small business clients with fewer than 50 workers to keep its data current. All businesses whose wage data is included in the report must have run payroll for the month that the data is being compiled and the three months prior. According to a Paychex spokesperson, the sample includes millions of small-business workers. How many small-business workers are there in Missouri and in the United States? It depends what you consider a small business. Paychex defines a small business as a firm with fewer than 50 workers, but the U.S. Small Business Administration defines small businesses as firms with less than 500 workers. According to the SBAs 2019 profile for the state of Missouri, there are 1.2 million small business employees in the state of Missouri alone, and 58.9 million in the country. In other words, while Paychex represents a significant portion of small businesses, its not the whole pie. The company itself claims to work with one in 12 private sector employees. Parson said, Wages are on the rise — in fact we were the top small business wage growth state in the nation. This statement is backed by statistics from Paychex that showed it to be true for the month of April, although Missouri fell behind in later months.",0.7,0.5,1.0,0.6,0.4,0.5,0.5,0.6,0.7,mostly-true

Final Rating: Mostly True  ","It's important to pay attention to the Russian spy drama, but let's not ignore the fact that the following (10) bills have been introduced in the House.","If you inhabit the more liberal corners of social media, you may have seen a list of 10 Republican bills in your feed -- a reminder of the substantive changes that could result from unified GOP control of Washington. Heres the text of a common version thats circulating: OK - It's important to pay attention to the Russian spy drama, but let's not ignore the fact that the following bills HAVE been introduced: 1. HR 861 Terminate the Environmental Protection Agency 2. HR 610 Vouchers for Public Education 3. HR 899 Terminate the Department of Education 4. HJR 69 Repeal Rule Protecting Wildlife 5.

HR 147 Criminalizing Abortion (Prenatal Nondiscrimination Act) 10. HR 808 Sanctions against Iran Please copy/paste and share widely. Call your House Representative and ask them to not only vote NO...but to speak up for our rights, health & safety, and our beautiful country. How accurate is the post? All 10 bills cited do exist, and most (though not all) have been accurately described. But a majority of the bills mentioned havent advanced very far or attracted more than a few co-sponsors, so many are relative longshots for actually becoming law. How accurate are the descriptions? Most of the bills listed are described by their official title, or by a truncated version of the official title. So those strike us as being accurate. But for a few bills, the description is overly broad or misleading. One of those -- H.J.R. 69 -- is described as Repeal Rule Protecting Wildlife. Thats on the right track, but whoever reads this wouldnt know that its specific to certain types of federal land in Alaska. The measure is an effort to overturn a federal rule using the Congressional Review Act, which allows Congress to repeal executive branch regulations under certain circumstances. The measure in question would overrule an Obama administration rule governing non-subsistence taking of wildlife on National Wildlife Refuge land in Alaska. As it happens, this is the only one of the 10 measures that has passed the House already. It passed by a mostly party-line, 225-193 margin on Feb. 16, 2017. It is now awaiting action in the Senate. Another bill with a somewhat exaggerated description is H.R. 785, which is listed as National Right to Work (this one ends unions). Right-to-work laws say workers cant be forced to join a union. They do this by making it harder to form a union, and its true that on average, states that have right-to-work laws have significantly lower unionization rates than states that dont. But its an exaggeration to say that it ends unions. In fact six of the states that have right to work laws have between 10 and 16 percent of their workforces unionized -- Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Michigan, Nevada, and West Virginia. And the remainder of right-to-work states do have unions -- theyre just less common than in the states that dont have a right-to-work law. The third and last of the exaggerated descriptions refers to H.R. 147, which is listed as Criminalizing Abortion (Prenatal Nondiscrimination Act). This bill would criminalize one particular kind of abortion -- one sought based on the sex, gender, color or race of the child, or the race of a parent. Thats not to say its not controversial -- it is. Referring to last years version of the bill, then-Rep. Loretta Sanchez, D-Calif., called the measure an affront to all minority women, especially Latinas and immigrant women, who already face disproportionate barriers to access health care and health education. But contrary to the most obvious reading of the social media post, this bill would not criminalize abortion across the board. How much support do these bills have? A few are likely to go far. For the rest, probably not. Lets start with the bills where eventual passage seems quite plausible. As we noted, the Alaska wildlife measure has already passed the House and must now be taken up by the Senate. Two other bills listed are unlikely to move in the version listed, but the ideas contained within them are likely to be taken up by the GOP leadership on a high-priority basis. One is H.R. 370, which would repeal the Affordable Care Act. H.R. 370 itself doesnt have a single co-sponsor, but repealing Obamas health care law is a high priority for House Republicans. An actual repeal-and-replace bill was released on March 6, and that is the likelier vehicle to be considered by the chamber. The other measure thats likely to advance, but not in the version listed in the post, is H.R. 354, which would stop federal funding for abortion providers such as Planned Parenthood. Federal funding for abortions is already banned, but opponents of abortion say that federal funding should be stopped for non-abortion services provided by clinics that offer abortions. The draft of the Obamacare repeal bill unveiled on March 6 would stop funding for such organizations. Of the other seven bills, none has advanced beyond introduction, and all but one have a minimal number of co-sponsors, all of them Republicans. Heres the rundown, as of March 7, 2017: • H.R. 861 -- Terminate the Environmental Protection Agency -- one sponsor, three co-sponsors. • H.R. 610 -- Vouchers for Public Education -- one sponsor, three co-sponsors. • H.R. 899 -- Terminate the Department of Education -- one sponsor, eight co-sponsors. • H.R. 785 -- National Right to Work (this one ends unions) -- one sponsor, 15 co-sponsors. • H.R. 83 -- Mobilizing Against Sanctuary Cities Bill -- one sponsor, nine co-sponsors. • H.R. 147 -- Criminalizing Abortion (Prenatal Nondiscrimination Act) -- one sponsor, 59 co-sponsors. • H.R. 808 -- Sanctions against Iran -- one sponsor, four co-sponsors. So just one of these bills have attracted co-sponsorship of more than 15 out of the 435 House members. The one that did, on prenatal sex selection, has been introduced for several congresses running and has only moved beyond introduction once. That was in 2012, when the House leadership put it up under so-called suspension of the rules. That means that a bill is fast-tracked to a vote, but to pass, it needs to win two-thirds support. The bill failed to meet the two-thirds threshold; on a mostly party-line vote, it secured 246 votes in favor and 168 votes against. For the rest, its conceivable that these can pass, especially in an environment -- as we have now -- with unified Republican control. Many of these bills address issues that President Donald Trump has advocated. That said, the House has only a limited amount of time, and co-sponsorship and committee consideration are key indications of what ranks high on the leaderships agenda. On these metrics, the remaining seven bills fall short of being considered top-tier priorities. Rather, these bills may have more of an impact in keeping the GOP base happy. John Feehery, a former aide to then-House Speaker Dennis Hastert, said most of the bills on the list seem like click-bait for fundraising to me. I find it it hard (to believe) that they go anywhere. Feehery is now president of the bipartisan lobbying firm Quinn Gillespie Associates. Our ruling The social media post listed 10 bills that it said have been introduced in the House by Republicans. All 10 bills in the post have in fact been introduced. Seven were described accurately, while three had somewhat exaggerated descriptions. Meanwhile, one of the 10 bills has passed, and two seem to be on a fast track, while the other seven are more accurately considered longshots. So the post is largely correct, but it includes some exaggerated language, and it fails to distinguish between top-tier agenda items and priorities further back in the pack.

Final Rating: Mostly True",Tourism and retirees are the dominant economic engines in our state.,"Florida is famous for its tourists and retirees. They spend plenty of bucks in the Sunshine State -- but is the state reliant on them for its economic strength? Former state Sen. Nan Rich, the underdog whos challenging former Gov. Charlie Crist in the Democratic gubernatorial primary, touched on that topic during a speech to the Florida Press Association in Coral Gables on July 11, 2014. (Crist spoke a day earlier; Republican Gov. Rick Scott declined an invitation to speak.) Our states economy is unlike any other in the country, Rich told the association, according to Miami Herald reporter David Smiley who attended the speech. Today, tourism and retirees are the dominant economic engines in our state. And while they do create jobs, they are mostly lower-paying service industry jobs. Since the economy is a top issue in the battle for governor, we decided to check her statement that tourism and retirees are the dominant economic engines in Florida. A look at the data We found no cut-and-dried answers to the question of which sectors are Floridas dominant economic engines. However, we did find evidence that shows tourism and retirees play an important role in the states economy -- too important, some say. Rich told PolitiFact Florida that she was relying on a 2014 report by the LeRoy Collins Institute, a public-policy group at Florida State University, titled, Tougher Choices: Shaping Floridas Future. It was written by professors Jim Dewey and David Denslow with the Bureau of Economic and Business Research at the University of Florida. The report examines state spending, demographics and jobs. Among the conclusions is that Floridas reliance on retirees and tourists comes at a price as the demands of older residents and tourists are disproportionately linked to lower-paid service jobs.  Compared to the rest of the nation, Florida has relatively fewer high-skill high-wage jobs and relatively more low-skill low-wage jobs, many serving tourists and retirees. Without the negative spin, the states official 2013 economic development plan concurs on the importance of tourism and population growth, which has traditionally been driven by retirees. Historically, Floridas economy has been driven by agriculture, tourism, the military, and population growth, which in turn produced gains in construction, real estate, retail trade, and services, the plan says. About 19 percent of Floridas population was at least 65 years old as of 2013, according to the U.S. Census. Bureau. Florida had the highest percentage of seniors in the nation as of 2010. We turned to the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis to look at real gross domestic product by industry in the state of Florida -- the total amount of economic activity by sector, adjusted for inflation. Unfortunately, the data does not include tourism or retirees as an industry. One category that combines arts, entertainment, recreation, accommodation and food service -- a rough approximation of tourism -- produced $46.9 billion in GDP in 2012. That was substantially smaller than the states biggest generator of GDP -- finance, insurance, real estate, rental and leasing, at $161.8 billion. But the latter category also includes some sectors relevant to Richs claim, such as real estate purchased by retirees. Other categories that exceeded the arts and entertainment sector included professional services, education and health care, and government. Some of these also generate economic activity due to seniors, particularly health care. The actual answer, apparently, appears to be more of an assumption than a provable fact. A Visit Florida spokeswoman told PolitiFact Florida that tourism is the states No. 1 industry and generates 23 percent of the states sales tax revenue and employs about 1.1 million Floridians. However, when we asked what economic measures prove that tourism is the top industry, Visit Florida spokeswoman Kathy Torian said: It's an aspirational statement rather than a scientific fact. ... We feel that the combination of sales tax revenue, employment and economic impact from visitor spending make the case for the tourism industry. Experts' views We also interviewed four economists who study the states economy, and they generally agreed that tourism and retirees play a vital role in Floridas economy, though with some quibbles. Bill Seyfried, an economist at Rollins College, said hed prefer the term important engines rather than dominant. Clearly, both tourism and retirees have strong impacts on the Florida economy -- more than most other states -- but the state economy is becoming more diversified as evidence by deeper integration with the global economy, which is likely to get a further boost with the expansion of the Panama Canal, as well as increased growth in professional/technical services, growing aerospace and life-science sectors, he said. Seyfried examined state GDP data from 2011-2013 and found that growth came from many sectors, not dominated by a few related to tourism. One can question whether some of the growth from 2011-2013 reflects a rebound from the crash, but the growth across sectors suggests a lack of overdependence on a few factors, such as tourism and retirees. Kwame Donaldson, an economist at Moodys, told PolitiFact Florida that the states large senior population influences many other aspects of the states economy. Because of Floridas large retiree population, its residents are more dependent on nonwage income than in any other state, which means that long periods of stock market gains (like the one we currently enjoying) provide an extra charge to Floridas economy, Donaldson said. In many, many ways, Floridas economy depends on its senior population, so I think it is accurate to describe this population as an economic engine. Our ruling Rich said, tourism and retirees are the dominant economic engines in our state. We didnt find a simple way to quantify whether tourism and retirees are the dominant economic engine in Florida, but a combination of statistical data and expert analysis suggests that both are important engines, and possibly too important, due to the low-wage jobs they bring.",0.7,0.5,1.0,0.6,0.0,0.4,0.5,1.0,0.6,mostly-true

Final Rating: Mostly False  ","Every time we've increased the minimum wage, we've seen a growth in jobs.","Raising the federal minimum wage is a high priority for President Barack Obama, but the issue is mired in debate over whether or not raising the minimum wage would kill jobs. The federal minimum wage is currently $7.25 an hour, and the White House and some congressional Democrats want to bump it up to $10.10 an hour. As of December, a majority of Americans support a raise. On Election Day, voters in Alaska, Arkansas, Nebraska and South Dakota approved state-level increases to minimum wages. Sen. Ben Cardin, D-Md., wants to see the minimum wage increased, and he defended the idea in an interview on Fox News Sunday Nov. 2, 2014. Every time we've increased the minimum wage, we've seen a growth in jobs, not a loss of jobs, Cardin said. The effect of minimum wage increases on job growth is at the core of this debate, so we wondered if Cardins claim was accurate. As youll see, the data is inconclusive, and there isnt an expert consensus -- even among leading economists. Some data Because Cardin was talking about congressional action, were going to focus on federal minimum wage increases and nationwide job growth. We asked Cardins staff and some economists, and we did some digging around, but there doesnt seem to be any published research that specifically answers the question: Was there job growth every year that Congress increased the federal minimum wage? (Theres plenty of research analyzing individual years, states or industries.) So we turned to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. For every year Congress increased the minimum wage since 1978, we looked at how much employment grew or shrank a year after the new wage went into effect. (The first federal minimum wage went into effect in 1938, but it was not consistent across all industries until 1978.) We know this measure doesnt account for other economic factors or state-level minimum wage increases. But we wanted to look at Cardins claim as literally as possible before turning to the larger debate. Below is a chart showing the years that Congress raised the minimum wage, employment the month that the change went into effect, and employment one year later, as well as the number of months that saw job growth. Year Wage ($) Employment - effective date (thousands) Employment - year later (thousands) Months of job growth Overall growth? 1978 2.65 84,595 88,810 12 Yes 1979 2.90 88,810 90,802 11 Yes 1980 3.10 90,802 91,037 8 Yes 1981 3.35 91,037 90,567 6 No 1990 3.80 109,688 108,367 2 No 1991 4.25 108,367 108,527 8 Yes 1996 4.75 120,677 123,945 11 Yes 1997 5.15 123,604 126,775 12 Yes 2007 5.85 137,984 137,421 5 No 2008 6.55 137,421 130,617 0 No 2009 7.25 130,617 130,395 4 No  So Cardins claim isnt literally true. Increasing the federal minimum wage isnt always followed by national job growth, or loss for that matter. There were 12 solid months of job growth following the 1978 increase, but 12 months of job loss following the 2008 increase. Also, these minimum wage changes did not happen in a vacuum. The last three federal minimum wage increases (2007, 2008 and 2009) were followed by significant job losses, but that was all taking place amidst the global financial crisis. And the minimum wage increases in the 1990s that preceded job growth happened during an economic boom. The debate So what do the experts say? Economists are split over what effect minimum wage has on job growth. Theres some research that shows raising the minimum wage negatively impacts job growth, and a lot that shows it has an insignificant effect. For an idea of how split economists are, look at this University of Chicago poll. Researchers asked about 40 leading economists, if raising the federal minimum wage would make it noticeably harder for low-skilled workers to find employment. In response, 34 percent agreed with the statement, 32 percent disagreed, and 24 percent were unsure. One of the most thorough reports on this debate comes out of the Center for Economic and Policy Research, a progressive think tank. The report concludes that the bulk of the best statistical evidence shows little to no effect on employment when the minimum wage goes up. Those who say raising the minimum wage results in job loss generally follow the logic that when workers become more expensive, businesses will be less likely to hire them, and unemployment follows. David Neumark is an economist who has researched the issue and believes raising the minimum wage reduces employment for the lowest skilled workers. He noted, though, that the economy has grown over the long term, resulting in job growth in all wage and skill levels. The causes of growth, and the business cycle as well, completely swamp (increases to) the minimum wage, said Neumark, director of the Center for Economics and Public Policy at the University of California Irvine. There are a few other things to keep in mind when it comes to minimum wage increases. First, it doesnt affect that many people. Only about 2.6 percent of all wage and salaried workers in the United States are paid at or below federal minimum wage, according to 2013 Bureau of Labor Statistics data. Additionally, 23 states (and some municipalities) have minimum wages higher than the federal minimum wage. Theres also the question of whether or not minimum wage has actually increased. Yes, the sticker price gets higher, but those increases have not kept up with inflation. Adjusted for 2013 dollars, the current minimum wage is a couple of bucks lower than it was in the late 1960s. This Pew Research chart compares minimum wage in 2013 dollars to their unadjusted levels.  All this means that small adjustments to the minimum wage have historically had little effect on employment, said David Gleicher, an economist at Adelphi University who has researched labor economics. Thus there has been virtually no significant increase in prices because of higher costs, nor a significant increase in unemployment, Gleicher said. At the same time, there has not been all that much of an increase in demand causing a significant increase in jobs. Our ruling Cardin said, Every time we've increased the minimum wage, we've seen a growth in jobs, not a loss of jobs. We looked at nationwide employment data in the years following minimum wage increases since 1978, and sometimes there was job growth, and sometimes there was job loss. Modern research tends to show that raising the minimum wage has little significant impact -- positive or negative -- on employment. Cardin got carried away when he said increasing the minimum wage is always followed by job growth.",0.0,1.0,1.0,0.5,0.0,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,mostly-false

Final Rating: Mostly False  ",Pentagon confirms they may court martial soldiers who hold Christian faith.,"No more military chaplains? Soldiers court-martialed for their Christian faith? PolitiFact readers wanted to know if headlines across websites such as Breitbart.com and MrConservative.com last week were true. Pentagon May Court Martial Soldiers Who Share Christian Faith, said Breitbart.com, claiming that the Pentagon has released a statement confirming that soldiers could be prosecuted. It could effectively abolish the position of chaplain in the military, the post said. Pentagon Confirms They May Court Martial Soldiers Who Hold Christian Faith, said MrConservative.com, explaining that the Pentagon has released an official statement affirming that it will court martial 'proselytization. So, did the Pentagon confirm it might court-martial soldiers who hold Christian faith? Welcome to the latest battle for soldiers hearts and minds. Pentagon meeting The recent hubbub has roots in the early 2000s, when a man named Mikey Weinstein watched his sons follow in his footsteps at the U.S. Air Force Academy in Colorado Springs. The Jewish students both faced Christian proselytizing, the family says, and in some cases, anti-Semitic slurs. An Air Force task force investigated accusations that the academy created a discriminatory climate, after a 2004 survey showed cadets complained that evangelical Christians had pressured Jews and other Christians. It found a need for policy guidance for commanders and supervisors regarding religious expression, not just at the academy, but across the Air Force. In 2005, Weinstein — a former Air Force attorney who worked in President Ronald Reagan's administration — unsuccessfully sued the Air Force for failing to prevent proselytizing. In 2006, he turned his attention full-time to his nonprofit Military Religious Freedom Foundation, saying he was fighting off far-right militant radical evangelical religious fundamentalists. (He also writes about fundamentalist Christian monsters who unite around horrific hatred and blinding bigotry, which doesnt exactly endear him to groups he targets, such as the Family Research Council.) Fast-forward to a Washington Post blog in late April. Sally Quinn, who writes about religion for the Washington Post's On Faith blog, spoke with Weinstein and others on their way to meet with several generals and a military chaplain. Weinstein had asked for months for the April 23 sit-down, which included his board members Larry Wilkerson, a former chief of staff to Colin Powell, and Joe Wilson, a former ambassador. The three planned to exhort the military to punish proselytizing. They pointed Quinn to examples such as a chaplain telling troops — including Afghan soldiers — to get right with Jesus, Marine officers changing the name of their attack squadron to the Crusaders (Weinsteins group got them to change it back) and a military contractor putting references to the New Testament on gun sights (again, Weinstein fought to have them removed). Its a workplace violation, Wilson said. This is a national security threat, Weinstein said. Weinstein also got an officer to remove an atheist bumper sticker from his car because it bothered an evangelical Christian. But, the men argued, the military itself needed to do more to protect troops who feel their religious freedom is undermined. Quinn quoted Wilson: You need half a dozen court-martials real quick. Quinns post, published Friday, April 26, caught the attention of Fox News Radio commentator Todd Starnes. Monday, April 29, he asked the Pentagon: Is there a plan to court-martial chaplains who proselytize? Heres what the Defense Department spokesman Nate Christensen told him: The Department of Defense places a high value on the rights of members of the Military Services to observe the tenets of their respective religions and respects (and supports by its policy) the rights of others to their own religious beliefs, including the right to hold no beliefs. The Department does not endorse any one religion or religious organization, and provides free access of religion for all members of the military services. Court martials and non-judicial punishment are decided on case-by-case basis and it would be inappropriate to speculate on the outcome in specific cases. However, religious proselytization is not permitted within the Department of Defense. Starnes wrote: The Pentagon confirmed to Fox News that Christian evangelism is against regulations. Religious proselytization is not permitted within the Department of Defense, LCDR Nate Christensen said in a written statement. He declined to say if any chaplains or service members had been prosecuted for such an offense. Court martials and non-judicial punishments are decided on a case-by-case basis and it would be inappropriate to speculate on the outcome in specific cases, he said. The Internet took over from there. Weinstein had been hired by the Pentagon to help shape policy on  religious tolerance, said Investors Business Daily. (Not true.) President Barack Obamas Defense Department was promising to bring criminal charges against any military personnel who express or share their faith, said a PA Pundits blogger. (Also not true.) And an anonymous blogger at MrConservative.com, citing Breitbart.com, declared, Pentagon Confirms They May Court Martial Soldiers Who Hold Christian Faith. PolitiFact reached out to Nate Christensen at the Defense Department, who said his statement was grossly taken out of context. On May 2, he clarified: Service members can share their faith (evangelize), but must not force unwanted, intrusive attempts to convert others of any faith or no faith to one's beliefs (proselytization). If a service member harasses another member on the basis of race, color, sex, religion, national origin, age, or disability, then the commander takes action based on the gravity of the occurrence. Likewise, when religious harassment complaints are reported, commanders take action based on the gravity of the occurrence on a case by case basis. ... We work to ensure that all service members are free to exercise their Constitutional right to practice their religion in a manner that is respectful of other individuals' rights to follow their own belief systems; and in ways that are conducive to good order and discipline; and that do not detract from accomplishing the military mission. Weinstein, he said, wasnt part of any Defense Department advisory group or committee, nor was he a consultant on religious issues. Theres a line there The military has grappled for years with how to balance the rights of people exercising different religious beliefs, or no beliefs. Weinsteins group had urged the Pentagon to enforce a recent Air Force policy on government neutrality regarding religion. He wants to see courts-martial under the Uniform Military Code of Justices Article 92, Failure to Obey Order or Regulation, for those who dont follow orders not to proselytize. Rules in place since last year say that Air Force leaders must avoid the actual or apparent use of their position to promote their personal religious beliefs to their subordinates or to extend preferential treatment for any religion. Meanwhile, all airmen are able to choose to practice their particular religion, or subscribe to no religious belief at all. You should confidently practice your own beliefs while respecting others whose viewpoints differ from your own. Rules for military chaplains already reflect this tightrope act. Theyre affiliated with outside religious organizations, but must support troops of all faiths. They're very careful about how they offer advice, said Lori Bogle, an associate history professor at the U.S. Naval Academy who writes about religion and the military. They are more like counselors. And if a person expresses a religious interest, they might go there. Thats been the general policy as long as she knows — even back to the 1940s. But in times of stress, the military has briefly embraced evangelism, such as during the early Cold War, when character guidance programs and seminars took on an overtly Christian cast in response to an atheist enemy. But that stopped by the mid 1960s, she said. So, its not necessarily new or surprising the Pentagon would say proselytizing isnt permitted. But groups such as the Family Research Council argue the policy outlined by the Defense Department spokesman last week is incoherent, asking how the military will distinguish between evangelizing and proselytizing. It has launched a petition to urge the defense secretary from censoring the full solace of the gospel. Meanwhile, a Coast Guard rear admiral, William Lee, spoke last week of his discomfort with current rules — he wants to be able to hand Bibles to suicidal servicemen. Ken Klukowski, director of the Center for Religious Liberty at the Family Research Council, says millions of Christians, including evangelicals, devout Catholics and observant Mormons, believe they are required by the New Testament to share their faith with others. This is to be done respectfully and peacefully, at appropriate times and in an appropriate manner, but it must be done when such opportunities present themselves, he wrote. To say that sharing the gospel is a crime under military law  is to say that tens of millions of Americans are not allowed to serve in our military. So, to some, to hold Christian faith is synonymous with promoting that faith to co-workers and subordinates. Under that interpretation, they could theoretically face court-martial if others found their attempts intrusive or harassing. But so far, Weinsteins urging hasnt resulted in such a court-martial. Our ruling Recent headlines and articles offered versions of the claim that the Pentagon confirms they may court-martial soldiers who hold Christian faith. Instead, a Defense Department spokesman had explained that proselytizing — unwanted, intrusive attempts to convert others — wasnt permitted and that punishment for breaking military rules is decided case by case. Conservative religious groups argue this means sharing the gospel would become a crime. But no policy we saw suggests that the Pentagon would court-martial soldiers who hold Christian faith. Quite the opposite — much of the language from the Defense Department reinforces the right of military members to practice their religion, as long as its in a way that respects others belief systems. Chaplains already follow such rules. Still, theres a sliver of truth — if you believe your Christian faith compels you to try to convert others in a way people find harassing, its possible you could face court-martial, though such a thing has yet to happen.",0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,mostly-false

Final Rating: Mostly False","The Stupak Amendment doesn't just say you can't use your federal insurance subsidy to pay for an abortion, it says, if you're getting a federal subsidy of any kind, you're not allowed to buy an insurance plan that covers abortion even with your own money.","An amendment to the House health care bill about abortion coverage continues to inspire political passions, driving a wedge between abortion-rights supporters who are outraged at what they consider a major loss for women's rights, and Democratic lawmakers who dread seeing their long-awaited reform effort potentially stalled due to the highly controversial debate.We've examined the role of  abortion coverage in the health care debate  numerous times, specifically as it relates to this amendment, including  a recent claim by Rep. Nita Lowey  . But on Nov. 12, 2009, MSNBC host Rachel Maddow addressed the issue again, and we thought we'd take another crack at it.Congressman Stupak and his supporters say that this Stupak Amendment would simply maintain the status quo, Maddow said on her show. It should be noted that that's baloney. The Stupak Amendment doesn't just say you can't use your federal insurance subsidy to pay for an abortion, it says, if you're getting a federal subsidy of any kind, you're not allowed to buy an insurance plan that covers abortion even with your own money. That's the first bit of dishonesty going on here.The amendment, sponsored by Reps. Bart Stupak, D-Mich., and Joe Pitts, R-Pa., was a last-minute addition to the House legislation and passed due to support from Republicans and antiabortion Democrats. It establishes restrictions on how abortion can be covered under the bill's virtual health insurance exchanges. These exchanges are designed to help people buy coverage if they are not currently insured, or if they work for businesses that are too small to offer health coverage to employees.Essentially, the Stupak-Pitts amendment bars abortion coverage for those who choose the public option, which is the House bill's federally administered, but privately funded, insurance plan. (Cases of rape, incest or a danger to the life of the mother are exempted.) The amendment also prevents anyone who accepts federal subsidies for health coverage from purchasing a plan with abortion coverage on the exchange.However, the amendment does allow people purchasing insurance on the exchange to choose a plan with abortion coverage if they pay for it without federal subsidies. Those who do accept subsidies can purchase an abortion rider -- that is, a separate policy covering abortion -- as long as they pay for it entirely with their own money.Many supporters of abortion rights argue that the amendment represents a severe infringement on a procedure that has been upheld by the Supreme Court. They say that relatively few women will be able to buy insurance on the exchanges without subsidies, making the exception for unsubsidized purchases close to meaningless. And they say that the idea of a rider isn't all it's cracked up to be. For one thing, abortion-rights supporters argue, women won't be likely to purchase separate coverage for a procedure they never expect to need. In addition, they say, insurance companies will be unlikely to offer abortion coverage because of the bill's logistical hurdles. For instance, the bill requires that insurers offering plans on the exchange that cover abortion also have to offer an identical plan that does not cover abortion.All of these factors, abortion-rights supporters say, indicate that insurers will simply take the path of least resistance and decline to offer abortion coverage. If this happens, the law could end up diminishing the abortion coverage options for people on the exchange.In our previous ruling, we drew a distinction between what the law does and what might possibly happen in the law's wake. The law spells out quite clearly that abortion coverage can be obtained on the exchange, even by those who are subsidized. By contrast, the notion that low demand for, and low supply of, abortion coverage could hamper women's access to abortion struck us as a different matter. We concluded that it's too speculative to say that this scenario will definitely come to pass.As we look at Maddow's statement, we'll start by giving her credit for using more careful wording than have many of her fellow abortion-rights supporters, including the subject of our prior fact-check, Rep. Nita Lowey, D-N.Y. Whether by design or not, Maddow hewed quite closely to the actual language of the amendment when she said that if you're getting a federal subsidy of any kind, you're not allowed to buy an insurance plan that covers abortion even with your own money. In fact, the amendment text does, on eight separate occasions, make a distinction between a plan and supplemental coverage.Specifically, the amendment says that people who buy subsidized insurance on the exchange cannot buy an insurance plan that includes abortion coverage. But the amendment does allow subsidized people to purchase supplemental coverage that covers abortion, as long as they do it with their own money.We believe that Maddow's failure to mention the option of buying supplemental coverage -- a rider -- undercuts her broader argument that if you're getting a federal subsidy of any kind, you're not allowed to buy an insurance plan that covers abortion even with your own money. We'll concede that the amendment's language does draw a distinction between buying a plan and buying supplemental coverage, but the difference is likely to be lost on viewers without expertise either in the insurance business or in legislative drafting.We ran our argument by Maddow. She gamely disagreed.I absolutely stand by my comment, she wrote in an e-mail. Get real, you guys. It's crazy to argue that the real impact of the Stupak Amendment will be that women receiving federal subsidies (probably the vast majority of women in the exchange) will just buy 'abortion insurance,' since abortion wouldn't be covered as health care under their health insurance anymore. Women are really going to get a specific insurance rider that they'd pay for every month, for a procedure no one ever plans on having or thinks they'll ever have to have? Really? Come on.But we think her response only strengthens the argument that the law isn't, itself, barring abortion coverage. Saying, as she does, that the burden of purchasing or not purchasing abortion insurance would fall to women tacitly confirms that the law does indeed allow subsidized women on the exchange to buy abortion coverage.Meanwhile, contrary to suggestions that insurers won't offer abortion riders, our research shows that they do exist in at least three of the five states that already have rules similar to the Stupak amendment on the books. In Oklahoma and Kentucky -- both of which which bar insurers from offering elective abortion coverage as part of a comprehensive plan -- regulatory officials told PolitiFact that such riders do exist, because insurance companies must file paperwork with the state before they sell such policies.In addition, Paula Gianino, president and chief executive for Planned Parenthood of the St. Louis region, told the  St. Louis Beacon  that she estimates 7 percent to 10 percent of the roughly 6,000 abortions provided annually at its St. Louis facility are covered by private insurance. Since companies in Missouri are banned from purchasing plans with abortion coverage except by rider, these examples show that some abortion riders are being purchased in that state.However, none of these states keeps track of how many companies offer the riders, or how many people have purchased them.Ultimately, we'll give Maddow credit for linguistic care, but we continue to hold that the Stupak Amendment does not, as she suggests, prevent subsidized women on the exchange from buying abortion coverage. They can buy a rider that adds that coverage.  Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

Final Rating: Mostly False  ","Because of the current immigration crisis, Republicans want to repeal a 2008law that President George W. Bush signed and want to be on record as not wanting to protect children from ...sex trafficking.","One of President George W. Bushs last acts in office was signing the non-controversialWilliam Wilberforce Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of 2008, which contained a provision guaranteeing formal deportation hearings for child immigrants not from Mexico and Canada and without family in the United States. This guaranteed hearing is now at the center of the crisis on our southern border, as thousands of children stream into this country from Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador. On the July 23 edition of Last Word, MSNBCs Lawrence ODonnell pointed to discussion of the 2008 Bush law as an example of the misinformation Republicans are spreading on immigration. ODonnell played a clip where Rep. Mo Brooks, R-Ala., implies that the 2008 law -- which was intended to provide protection for victims of sex trafficking -- shouldnt apply to the children presently crossing the border. Theres no evidence, Brooks said, that this 60-to-90,000 illegal alien children mass that has come to America are coming here to be sex slaves or something of that nature. ODonnell took Brooks statement to what he saw as a logical conclusion. One of the positions that these Republicans are holding, ODonnell said, is that they want to repeal the law that President Bush signed, which is about protecting children from sex trafficking. So they want to be on record as not wanting to protect children from this kind of sex trafficking. We were skeptical that the Republican position is to repeal the 2008 law entirely, so we decided to dig deeper. What happens when a child arrives at the border When unaccompanied minors from Mexico and Canada are apprehended at the border, theyre screened by Border Patrol within 48 hours to determine whether they are victims of trafficking or have credible asylum claims. Those that do get a formal hearing, and those that dont are bussed back, often within 12 hours of their arrival. The process for children from other countries starts the same, with an initial Border Patrol screening. But the 2008 law mandates that these children -- most of them from Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador -- are sent to the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) after their screening, regardless of whether or not they have asylum claims.  The HHS subjects these children to a more thorough medical check, and then the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) transports them to a HHS shelter. From there, the children are released to relatives or other sponsors to await their guaranteed hearings. These hearings often dont occur, though, for years, and shelters are getting overcrowded -- this is what pundits are referring to the immigration crisis. Compared to the roughly 3,000 non-Mexican minors apprehended at the border in 2009, the tens of thousands of minors crossing the border now are simply too much for the DHS and HHS to process. Laws are complicated While the provision dictating border policy is getting most of the attention, theres more to the 2008 law. It also renewed funding for a 2000 anti-trafficking bill and laid out plans for sanctions and research to combat trafficking. Theres an ongoing debate about whether the Obama administration is properly enforcing the letter of the 2008 law. Conservatives and groups such as the Center for Immigration Studies, which supports tighter immigration enforcement, say the 2008 law guarantees hearings only forunaccompanied alien childrenwho do not haveparents or legal guardians in the United States. Yet, according to the center, up to77 percent of non-Mexican children arriving at the border without family members are being released to family members within the United States. These children, they argue, shouldnt be eligible for a hearing. Its unclear to what extent the 2008 law is the cause of the backlog of children -- but as weve addressed elsewhere, its certainly a major factor. What Republicans have proposed ODonnell is right insofar that Republicans have honed in on the 2008 law as a major source of the current immigration crisis. But the prevailing thought among Republicans is that the law should be amended, not repealed. House Speaker John Boehner said July 17 that Congress couldnt begin to mitigate the problem at the border if you dont do something about the 08 law thats being abused. And it is being abused. The only Republican we found saying the law should be repealed is Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz. We insist on having the 2008 law repealed as part of any immigration bill, McCain saidon July 11. Senate Democrats, he said,are not willing to do that. But it is fairly clearMcCain misspoke. Legislation proposed by McCain and Sen. Jeff Flake, R-Ariz., specifically calls for amending the 2008 law, not repealing it, and McCain spokesman Brian Rogers told us on July 30that McCain wants to amend the 2008 law. Other formal proposals from the GOP all call for revising, not repealing the2008 law. Some Democrats, including Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.V., also support revising the law. There have been nine proposals related to the 2008 law from Republicans in the Senate and the House. And, according to Grant Newman of immigration research group NumbersUSA, all of these proposals involve amending the 2008 law, albeit in different ways. There have been no formal proposals, Newman said, for repeal. Most of the Republican attempts, their whole goal is to try to treat children from Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras and in some cases, any child, like we treat Mexican nationals, where we can expedite removal, Newman said. A proposal by Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, and Rep. Henry Cuellar, D-Texas, for example, would eliminate the distinction between countries of origin. Under their proposal, called the HUMANE Act, all children -- not just those from Mexico and Canada -- would be screened by the Border Patrol within 48 hours, and those without claims to amnesty or evidence that theyve been trafficked would be removed as soon as possible, like Mexicans are under current law. Children who pass the Border Patrol screening would be submitted to a second screening within seven days in front of a judge, with a higher burden of proof than the Border Patrol screening but a lower burden than a formal hearing. Migrants who meet that burden of proof would be sent to the HHS to await a formal hearing as in current law, and migrants who dont would be removed. A House GOP working group formed by Boehner and led by Rep. Kay Granger, R-Texas, has released similar recommendations. The working group recommended an amendment to the 2008 law so all unaccompanied minors are treated the same as Mexicans for the purpose of removals. So the Republicans who want to change the 2008 law have all proposed revisions, not repeal. Its worth noting that Congress rarely repeals laws in full -- theyre too complicated for that -- but ODonnell still mischaracterized Republicans stance on the 2008 law. Protections for trafficking victims ODonnell does, though, have something of a point that Republicans are removing protections for victims of sex trafficking. Opponents of the Republican proposals about the 2008 law break mainly into partisan camps. According to NumbersUSA, many Republicans are unconvinced that the 2008 law even applies to the surge children, the majority of whom arent unaccompanied alien children under federal law. The burden to fix the immigration crisis, they say, falls solely on the executive branch. Democratic opponents of these proposals -- including Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid -- have pointed instead their injustice towards child migrants. Sen. Robert Menendez, D-N.J., for example, criticized the HUMANE Act, saying it undermines the due process rights of a child that exists under existing law. And advocates from Texas immigration rights group LUPE criticized the HUMANE Act on the grounds that it doesnt provide children enough time to open up to officials. They gave the example of Sara, a sex-trafficking victim who wasnt identified as such until she spoke to a social worker two months into her detention. Under the Cornyn-Cuellar proposal, they said, Sara would have been sent back to her abusers. But while proposals to revise the 2008 law may get rid of some safeguards for victims of sex trafficking, they dont get rid of all of them. Current law gives immigrants from Mexico the opportunity to make their case when screened, and Republican proposals would give Central American children at least that much protection. The GOP working groups recommendations, for example, would give children who dont want to be returned to their home countries a screening by child welfare professionals and an expedited removal hearing within seven days after that screening. Our ruling ODonnell took a soundbite from Republican congressman Mo Brooks to mean that Republicans want to repeal the law that President Bush signed in 2008 to protect victims of sex trafficking. ODonnell concluded that Republicans want to be on record as not wanting to protect children from this kind of sex trafficking. Republicans want to amend, not repeal the 2008 law. But its an open debate what these changes would mean for victims of sex trafficking. These proposals leave Central American children with some protections, but without what human rights advocates have characterized as a major protection.",0.5,0.7,1.0,0.5,0.6,0.6,0.4,0.8,0.5,mostly-false

Final Rating: Mostly False  ",Says Joe Biden tried to cut Social Security and Medicare for decades.  Now Bidens promising your benefits to illegal immigrants.,"An ad seeking to sway Florida voters to President Donald Trumps side claims that Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden has long attempted to take away benefits from Americans and now wants to give them to immigrants illegally in the country. The ads claims are inaccurate and misleading. Joe Biden tried to cut Social Security and Medicare for decades. ... Now, Biden is promising your benefits to illegal immigrants, says the narrator in the ad posted by Trump for Florida, an official Facebook page for Trump's reelection campaign. Heres an overview of the inaccurate elements in the 30-second video posted Sept. 16. This is not a complete reflection of Bidens record, which has changed over time. Starting in the 1970s, Biden called for an increase in monthly benefits, then for a one-year freeze, then floated raising the retirement age, then backed a change in how benefits would increase, and now calls for higher monthly checks for the oldest beneficiaries. In the 1980s and 1990s, Biden spoke in favor of freezes to Social Security as part of an effort to rein in all spending to reduce the deficit. In a 1995 speech, Biden said: When I argued that we should freeze federal spending, I meant Social Security as well. I meant Medicare and Medicaid. I meant veterans benefits. I meant every single solitary thing in the government. And I not only tried it once. I tried it twice. I tried it a third time, and I tried it a fourth time. The Trump ad features a clip of that 1995 speech, but it cut out the part where Biden said he meant freezing every single solitary thing in the government. Bidens campaign told PolitiFact that throughout his career in Congress, Biden cast nearly 50 votes to increase Social Security benefits or block Republican plans to curtail benefits. As vice president during the Obama administration, Biden generally focused on protecting Social Security, and resisted moves to privatize Social Security. However, the administration in 2014, proposed changing how Social Security cost-of-living increases were calculated. The method, which the left-leaning Center for Budget and Policy Priorities found would have reduced benefits by 1% to 2% over the course of the average retirement, received push-back and was later dropped. Biden as a presidential candidate says action is urgently needed to make the program solvent and prevent cuts to American retirees. The Trump ad cites as evidence for its claim a Jan. 13 article from The Intercept, headlined, Fact Check: Joe Biden Has Advocated Cutting Social Security for 40 Years. The story said that Bidens 2020 position to increase Social Security benefits is at odds with decades of his own advocacy. It cited his stance in the 1980s and 1990s among evidence of his interest in practicing fiscal restraint. During the Democratic presidential primary, Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., similarly claimed that Biden has advocated cutting Social Security for 40 years. This is not Bidens promise. There is no evidence Biden seeks to deprive Americans of their Social Security and Medicare benefits and give them to immigrants who are violating immigration laws. Bidens plans related to health care and seniors do not call for the elimination of Social Security benefits or Medicare for Americans. And Biden has not put forward a policy to entitle immigrants illegally in the country to Social Security benefits, or to give them access to Medicare, his campaign said. Biden favors allowing immigrants illegally in the country to buy health care plans under the Affordable Care Act marketplace, but without financial help from the government. This would not invalidate U.S. citizens and lawful permanent residents ability to also buy health care plans in the exchange. The Trump ad cited May 10, 2019, Fox News reporting. That day, Fox News said Biden supported health care for immigrants illegally in the country. The story said that in response to a question on whether immigrants illegally in the country should should be entitled to federal benefits like Medicare or Medicaid, Biden said: Look, I think that anyone who is in a situation where they are in need of health care, regardless of whether they are documented or undocumented, we have an obligation to see that they are cared for. Video of that response doesnt show Biden explicitly mentioning Medicare or Medicaid. Trump in July falsely claimed that under Bidens policy, immigrants in the country illegally get welfare benefits. United States citizens don't get what they're looking to give illegal immigrants. Trumps campaign did not respond to our queries, and neither did the White House. But a Trump campaign official told the Washington Posts Fact Checker that Biden supported Obama-era programs that defer deportation for immigrants and make them eligible for Social Security. As the Washington Post pointed out, people receive Social Security benefits if they pay into the system, and immigrants wouldnt be taking away your benefits, as the ad implied. A Trump campaign ad claimed, Joe Biden tried to cut Social Security and Medicare for decades. ... Now Bidens promising your benefits to illegal immigrants. Its misleading to say that Biden for decades tried to cut Social Security and Medicare. His overall record is mixed. The ad also gives the wrong impression that Biden is trying to take benefits away from Americans and grant them to immigrants illegally in the country. Thats not Bidens plan. Biden wants to allow immigrants illegally in the country to buy health insurance, without subsidies. That would not take away Ameicans ability to buy their own insurance.

Final Rating: Mostly False  ",Wendy Davis has already taken more $ from teacher unions than the past 3 Democrat gubernatorial candidates combined.,"Teacher groups often back Democrats for office; it shouldnt be a surprise Wendy Davis has such support. Still, a reader asked us to check an April 11, 2014, tweet from @WendyDavisTruth, a Twitter account run by the Republican Party of Texas. The tweet said, Wendy Davis has already taken more $ from teacher unions than the past 3 Democrat gubernatorial candidates combined. The tweet came with a bar chart comparing contributions by three teacher groups — the Texas State Teachers Association, Texas chapter of the American Federation of Teachers and the political arm of the Texas Classroom Teachers Association. The bar labeled 2014 Wendy Davis far exceeded comparable bars for Tony Sanchezs 2002 gubernatorial run, Chris Bells 2006 campaign and Bill Whites 2010 campaign. Heres the chart:  By the groups math, Davis has drawn $102,777 from the three teacher groups, while the previous three Democratic nominees for governor combined to attract $102,700. Republican Party of Texa administrator Beth Cubriel told us by email the figures were based on contribution and expenditure reports filed at the Texas Ethics Commission. She added that the figures reflect all contributions by the teacher groups to the candidates — not just contributions made while each one was running for governor. But labels on the chart — 2006 Bell and 2014 Wendy Davis, for example — left us with a different impression. One might not expect that previous campaigns for other offices would be included in those contribution totals. We looked next at how much each candidate drew from the singled-out groups while running for governor. By our calculations, Davis garnered about $67,000 of her contributions from the groups for her two tightly-contested Senate campaigns with about $36,000 coming in since she declared for governor Oct. 3, 2013. Likewise, Bell in 2006 drew no donations from the groups during his run for governor; his nearly $40,000 came during his 2008 campaign for a Texas Senate seat. By contrast, the teacher contributions to Sanchez in 2002 and White in 2010 were specifically for gubernatorial campaigns. By email, Cubriel said our breakdown succinctly covers what didn't fit into the four corners of the party's chart. The party never claimed the money was given to her gov(ernor) campaign directly, she said. The years on the chart are to serve as a reminder of when each candidate was the nominee. We told Cubriel that our review of campaign-finance reports turned up a sizable contribution not included in the partys critique--$125,000 gained by Daviss gubernatorial kitty on Jan. 15, 2014, from the Washington, D.C.-based American Federation of Teachers Committee on Political Education. Cubriel said by phone that party researchers didnt search records for that group. That makes the case against her even worse, she said. Our ruling The Texas party said Davis has already taken more money from teacher unions, meaning three teacher groups, than the previous three Democratic gubernatorial candidates combined and presented a chart purporting to show that. The tweet and chart turned out to mislead. Most of the cited teacher groups giving to Davis came during her campaigns for state Senate, not during her run for governor. Running for governor, Davis has attracted about $36,000 from two of the groups and nothing from the third. That total trails the $65,000 combined raised by two of the previous nominees in their respective gubernatorial bids. Regardless, the claim has an element of truth. With career fund-raising factored in, Davis has topped the three previous Democratic gubernatorial nominees in support from the groups. Moreover, the party didn't mention a 2014 donation of $125,000 to Davis's campaign from a major teacher group.

Final Rating: Mostly False  ","Ron Johnson is trying to let insurance companies deny coverage to people with pre-existing conditions like cancer, depression, pregnancy, diabetes—or even COVID.","Its no secret that U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson isnt a fan of the Affordable Care Act, the Obama administrations signature health care law, passed in 2010. A hallmark of the law was its rule that health insurance companies cant refuse to cover people or charge them more if they have a pre-existing condition — a health problem they had before the insurance coverage started. Wisconsin State Treasurer Sarah Godlewski, a Democrat whos vying to unseat Johnson this fall, targeted Johnson this way in a April 1tweet: Ron Johnson is trying to let insurance companies deny coverage to people with pre-existing conditions like cancer, depression, pregnancy, diabetes — or even COVID. That coverage, of course, is a key provision in the Affordable Care Act. But does that mean Godlewski is right? When asked to provide evidence of her claim, Godlewskis office sent a list of votes Johnson has cast in favor of repealing or scaling back the health care law. Soon after he took office, Johnson cosponsored a bill to repeal the Affordable Care Act, saying in a Jan. 26, 2011, news release that it was the single greatest assault on our freedom in my lifetime. He voted multiple times to drop the laws individual mandate, which required most people to have health insurance or pay a penalty, and voted for a series of attempted repeals during the summer of 2017. But just because he wanted to get rid of the law doesnt necessarily mean he wanted people with pre-existing conditions to go without protections. After all, many Republicans have said they support that provision, and it is widely popular with voters. Godlewskis strongest evidence stems from a vote Johnson cast for the Better Care Reconciliation Act, an amendment to the GOP plan to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act. The final version of the amendment — which failed — would have allowed insurance companies to offer plans that could deny coverage to sick people as long as they carried at least one comprehensive plan that followed the Affordable Care Acts rules. Insurance companies and patient groups decried the amendment, saying it would make those comprehensive plans more costly and create two systems of insurance, one for healthy and one for sick people. In that specific instance, then, Johnson did vote for legislation that could have allowed insurance companies to have plans that denied people with pre-existing conditions coverage. But — to get technical — all of those companies would also have had to have at least one plan that did cover people with pre-existing conditions, even if it was likely to end up being expensive. Johnsons office said the senator has committed to protections for people with pre-existing conditions. They pointed to his introduction of the Protect Act in February 2021, which would prohibit health insurers from imposing exclusions on plans based on pre-existing conditions. (The bill has not moved from committee.) They also cited a response Johnson gave to a Milwaukee Journal Sentinel inquiry about his views on health care on March 17: The first step in any health care reform would assure everyone that people with preexisting conditions would be protected by having their insurance rates subsidized so that they pay the same rates as those without preexisting conditions. In a June 26, 2017, New York Times opinion piece criticizing the Republican alternative to the Affordable Care Act, Johnson wrote that he was in part dissatisfied with the bill because it leaves in place the pre-existing condition rules that drive up the cost of insurance for everyone. But he followed that by writing that the country should look to improve successful models for protecting individuals with pre-existing conditions, models underway prior to Obamacare. His statements are just that — statements. Skeptics may question whether the views are sincere, or if political roadblocks would prevent it from happening. But given current facts as theyre known, Godlewskis claim doesnt quite hold up. Godlewski claimed Johnson is trying to let insurance companies deny coverage to people with pre-existing conditions. The senator did cast a vote in 2017 that would have opened the door for insurance companies to offer such plans, but still would have required them to offer other plans that did provide that coverage. And hes said consistently that he aims to protect coverage for people with pre-existing conditions. Our definition of Mostly False is a statement that contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.

Final Rating: Mostly False",Says the late Lady Bird Johnson sicced the CIA on actress and singer Eartha Kitt after Kitt spoke out against the Vietnam War during a White House luncheon in January 1968.,"During an episode of Comedy Centrals Drunk History, comedian Nicole Byer described a conflict between the late Lady Bird Johnson and actress and singer Eartha Kitt when Johnson was first lady. During a July 2 episode, Byer said: Lady Bird calls the CIA and she goes, 'Yo listen, this b----? I don't like this b----. You better find everything you can about her so I can send it to other people so she doesn't work. Lady Bird is just like, Destroy her,  Byer said. We had to know whether Byers description of Texas icon Lady Bird Johnson was accurate. Comedy Central did not return a request for more information, so we consulted archival news coverage and spoke with historians to check this claim. Kitt was one of 50 women invited to the White House on Jan. 18, 1968, for a Women Doer's Luncheon to discuss crime among young people, according to a Jan. 19, 1968, New York Times story. Johnson frequently recorded her thoughts and reflections throughout her husband Lyndon Johnsons presidency, according to the LBJ Presidential Library and Museum. A transcript from a Jan. 18, 1968, recording details the day of the luncheon. Other women in attendance included governors wives, senators wives, journalists, and members of the National Emergency Committee on the National Council on Crime and Delinquency, according to Johnsons audio diary. Both President Lyndon Johnson and the first lady were at the luncheon. When Kitt rose to speak, she offered a sharp condemnation of the Vietnam War, according to the New York Times story. In her audio diary, Lady Bird Johnson said that Kitt took a step toward her, looking with intense directness at me, when she offered her critique. You send the best of this country off to be shot and maimed, Kitt said during the luncheon, according to the Times. They rebel in the street. They will take pot and they will get high. They dont want to go to school because theyre going to be snatched off from their mothers to be shot in Vietnam. Johnson said Kitts speech stunned the room into silence. Kitt wasn't the only entertainment icon to criticize the Johnson administration over the Vietnam War. Michael Gillette, a former historian at the LBJ Presidential Library, said journalist Walter Cronkite and actress Jane Fonda were among the public figures who spoke out against the war. Kitts comments were well documented in the press, as they caused quite a commotion. An anonymous letter to the first lady on Jan. 22, 1968, included racist language about Kitt and said she defiled the White House and made us all ashamed. A woman named Clarence Nowack left a message for Johnson on Jan. 20, 1968, to say she was proud of her son for volunteering to serve in the war, where he was killed. Warren E. Burger, then a federal appellate judge who would be named a year later to the U.S. Supreme Court, said in a Jan. 19, 1968, letter to Johnson that he and his wife were proud of how she composed herself during the luncheon. The unhappy episode at your recent luncheon impells me to write you to say that Mrs. Burger and I took a deep pride in the courage and composure you exhibited in the face of a gross breach of your hospitality and of good elementary manners, Burger said. A letter to the editor published on Jan. 27, 1968, in the Times said in part: There are even a few of us who believe that it is not really decent, or fair, to attack a man by insulting and humiliating his wife in the presence of other guests and the press. Kitt told the Times, according to a Jan. 23, 1968, article, that she had received telegrams, phone calls and mail from supporters who agreed with what she had said. Kitt later said in a June 7, 2006, video interview that she had not realized that the debacle at the White House affected her career until investigative reporter Seymour Hersh called her about the CIAs file on her. I didnt realize I was being rejected in the United States and I couldnt find work. I thought maybe my popularity is waning, my records sales are not up, Kitt said. Byer said Johnson asked the CIA to find damaging information on Kitt after the luncheon. We couldnt find evidence of this direct request. But the Secret Service did request information about Kitt from the CIA the day after the womens luncheon, according to Hersh's Jan. 3, 1975, story in the Times. Historians say it is unclear who directed the Secret Service to make the request. Secret Service officials said they asked the CIA for information on Kitt to see if she was a threat to President Johnson or others under their protection, according to the Times. The CIA gave a three-page report on Kitt to the Secret Service, a file the agency had maintained since at least 1956, because Kitt had done work overseas, the Times reported. The report stated that Kitt had a very nasty disposition and described her as being a spoiled child, very crude and having a vile tongue. We submitted an open records request to the CIA seeking the information in the report. The CIA responded: we did not locate any responsive records that would reveal a publicly acknowledged CIA affiliation with the subject. John Wilson, an archivist at the LBJ Presidential Library, said he doubts Lady Bird Johnson would have asked the CIA to investigate the star, and if she did, she would not have put it in writing. As far as actual power, first ladies dont have very much, but people would tend to listen, I would think, Wilson said. Whether or not she should or could ask is one thing, but if she did ask them informally, they would be a lot more likely to pay attention. Gillette said that Johnson would not have wanted to fan the flames around the Kitt incident. I knew her a long time and I knew a lot of people who knew her better than I did, and thats so out of character for her that its almost laughable, Gillette said. Drunk History claimed former first lady Lady Bird Johnson demanded the CIA find damning information on singer Eartha Kitt. While the Secret Service did request information from the CIA following the luncheon, there is no evidence to support the idea that Lady Bird Johnson asked for the information. The Secret Service said the request was made for security purposes, not to destroy her.

Final Rating: Mostly False",We have a higher deficit with China now than we did before.,"During the first presidential debate, Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden went after President Donald Trump over trade with China, an issue Trump often uses against Biden. You take a look at what he's actually done, he's done very little, Biden said. His trade deals are the same way. He talks about these great trade deals. You know, he talks about The Art of the Deal, China has perfected the art of the steal. We have a higher deficit with China now than we did before. In reality, the U.S. deficit with China in goods and services, the most inclusive trade measurement, was smaller under Trump in 2019, the most recent full year, than it was in any of the final three years of the Obama administration, in which Biden served as vice president. Heres the year-by-year data from the federal Bureau of Economic Analysis:  While the trade deficit in goods and services with China improved under Trump between 2018 and 2019, its still large in an absolute sense. The U.S. bought in excess of $300 billion more in goods and services from China in 2019 than China did from the U.S. Bidens campaign pointed to a more limited figure — trade in goods only — which shows that the trade deficit with China has generally been higher under Trump than it was under Obama. But even here, the U.S. made progress under Trump in 2019 in whittling down the goods deficit. The goods deficit was $375 billion in 2017, $418 billion in 2018, and $345 billion in 2019. The 2019 figure was similar to the level it was in 2016, the final year of the Obama administration. Biden said, We have a higher deficit with China now than we did before. The most inclusive measurement, for goods and services, shows that the U.S. trade deficit with China was smaller under Trump in 2019, the most recent full year, than it was in any of the final three years of the Obama administration. Looking only at goods shows the trade deficit was generally higher under Trumpthan it was in the Obama years, but it declined in 2019 to around the level as the final year of the Obama administration.",0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,mostly-false

Final Rating: Mostly False  ","Says Al Jazeera, a mouthpiece for terrorists, has been paying Jon Ossoff thousands of dollars. ... What is he hiding?","No Democrat has held Georgias 6th Congressional District since 1979. Now, in a race to replace Republican Tom Price who joined the administration as secretary of Health and Human Services, 30-year-old Democrat Jon Ossoff stands out. In a field packed with 16 candidates from both parties, the latest poll shows Ossoff with about 40 percent. He needs to break 50 percent on Election Day, April 18, to avoid a runoff. Republican groups and their allies aim to block that. The Congressional Leadership Fund, a super PAC aligned with House Speaker Paul Ryan, posted a web video that ties Ossoff to Al Jazeera, the Qatar-based news organization. The ad opens with shots of Islamic fighters followed by a grainy television snippet of Osama bin Laden talking. The voiceover says: Al Jazeera, a media outlet that has been described as a mouthpiece for terrorists, has been paying Jon Ossoff thousands of dollars. But Jon refuses to tell voters exactly how much money hes received. Just like Jon refuses to tell voters the truth about his experience. What is he hiding? The focus of this fact-check is on the ads statement, combined with the imagery that accompanies the claim, that Al Jazeera, a mouthpiece for terrorists, has been paying Jon Ossoff thousands of dollars. A mouthpiece for terrorists? The ad cites an article from the American Journalism Review to back up its description of Al Jazeera. The article, entitled The Al Jazeera Effect, centered on the news organizations strategy of getting on-the-ground camera footage and reporting in the early days of the Arab Spring protests. The article relays a variety of opinions that have been offered about Al Jazeera. The ad chose one from this passage: For years, critics have assailed what they see as anti-Semitic, anti-American bias in the channel's news content. In the wake of 9/11, Al Jazeera broadcast statements by Osama bin Laden and reported from within the ranks of the Taliban, earning a reputation as a mouthpiece for terrorists. But the article also quotes David Marash, a former Nightline correspondent who joined and then left Al Jazeera over concerns about anti-American bias. Despite that history, the article said Marash described Al Jazeera as the best news channel on earth.... Al Jazeera has become the model all around the world. Video reporting from the field sets them apart and makes them the best. Congressional Leadership Fund spokeswoman Courtney Alexander offered several other examples of criticism of Al Jazeera. A 2001 New York Times Magazine article said day in and day out, Al Jazeera deliberately fans the flames of Muslim outrage. A 2013 USA Today article quoted an Israeli center analyst who said Al Jazeeras Arab language broadcasts very often promote a very radical Islamist approach. Alexander also pointed to reports that the news network is backed by the Qatari government, and Qatar has been linked to financing terrorist groups. On the other hand, in 2011, Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., described Al Jazeera in glowing terms for its work during the Arab Spring. Im very proud of the role that Al Jazeera has played, McCain said. I congratulate you and I mourn for those who have sacrificed in the service of providing the information, which is knowledge, which is power. The point is, some people have a bad opinion of Al Jazeera and others think its done good work. The ad cherry-picked images and a quote that cast Al Jazeera in the most dubious light possible. That characterization was the basis for the rest of the ad. Al Jazeera payments to Ossoff The video said Al Jazeera has been paying Ossoff thousands of dollars. Its source is an article from the conservative website the Washington Free Beacon, based on Ossoffs congressional financial disclosure form. The report covered all of 2016 and nearly three months in 2017, and in it, Ossoff includes Al Jazeera as one client out of 13 that paid his firm Insight TWI at least $5,000. Insight TWI is a British-based documentary film production company. Ossoff became its CEO in 2013. Heres the key section from his disclosure:  The Washington Free Beacon asked Ossoff to go beyond the federal requirements and say how much he received from Al Jazeera. He didnt respond. As a technical matter, according to the experts we reached,the Al Jazeera payments went to the firm, not Ossoff as the video said. He was CEO and shared in the proceeds, but all we know is that Al Jazeera paid Insight TWI at least $5,000. In a statement, Ossoffs campaign said his firms clients include broadcasters in Britain, the Netherlands, Denmark and Sweden. Under Jons leadership, the companys investigations have resulted in the arrest of foreign officials stealing U.S.-taxpayer-funded aid and quack doctors who mutilate women, as well as exposed atrocities committed by ISIS in Iraq, including sexual slavery, the statement said. According to the Insight TWI website, the company produced 10 film projects since Ossoff took the helm. Of those, nine were for Al Jazeera. During the time period covered by Ossoffs financial disclosure, 2016 and 2017, there is only one film project reported for Al Jazeera. The other was for the BBC. The most recent Al Jazeera project was a six-part series on Latin America. Topics covered included child trafficking and sexual exploitation across the Argentina-Bolivia border, allegations of slave labor in Brazils garment industry and deaths in police custody in Mexico. Over the years, Al Jazeera paid Ossoffs company for investigations that revealed government corruption in Africa, extra-judicial killings, corrupt doctors selling HIV/AIDS drugs on the black market, and related themes. One film dealt with terrorists. It was produced for the BBC and followed a group of Yazidi women turned soldiers who seek revenge on ISIS fighters. Alexander of the Congressional Leadership Fund noted that Ossoff mentions the BBC but not Al Jazeera on his website. Ossoffs resume When Ossoff launched his campaign, he touted his national security background, saying he had five years under his belt as a congressional staffer. We found that was an exaggeration. By our count, he spent about three years in middle-to-senior level foreign policy posts. The ad says Ossoff refuses to tell voters the truth about his experience. On the contrary, the campaign provided a timeline (at the bottom of this link)showing what he did and when. Alexander told us that on the stump, Ossoff doesnt go out of his way to acknowledge his exaggeration. Our ruling The Congressional Leadership Fund video says Al Jazeera, a mouthpiece for terrorists, has been paying Jon Ossoff thousands of dollars and asks what is he hiding? This is a case when a series of partial truths are strung together to promote the worst possible conclusion. Some Americans have called Al Jazeera a mouthpiece of terrorists. Others, including a U.S. senator, have praised it as a beacon of reporting in the Middle East and Africa. The ad cherry-picks its evidence to characterize Al Jazeera only as aligned with terrorists. Al Jazeera did payOssoff's company.During the time frame covered in his financial disclosure, Ossoffs firm produced two film projects, one for Al Jazeera and one for the BBC. Al Jazeera has been a major client over the years, but going back to the start of 2016, it is one out of 13. In addition, the films Al Jazeera have commissioned focus on wrongdoing in Africa and Latin America and have nothing to do with the Middle East or terrorism. The ad suggests Ossoff is hiding something. Given the evidence at hand, the answer appears to be that he is unwilling to open the books of his business beyond what the law requires. The ads description of Al Jazeera strikes us as particularly selective and central to the suspicions the ad raises.",0.5,0.9,1.0,0.6,0.7,0.8,0.7,1.0,0.5,mostly-false

Final Rating: Mostly False  ",Says Betty Sutton and House Democrats gutted Medicare by $741 billion to pay for Obamacare.,"Mitt Romney rekindled a heated debate over Medicare by picking U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan as his running mate.Ryan, head of the Budget Committee in the U.S. House of Representatives, is the architect of a plan to dramatically restructure Medicare, which today operates as a government-run health insurance plan for Americans over age 65.Democratic congressional candidates are making the protection of traditional Medicare a centerpiece of their campaigns.The Republican response has been to attack back. In a series of news releases dealing with the national health care reform law, the National Republican Congressional Committee on Aug. 14 claimed 37 House Democrats are gutting $741 billion from Medicare to pay for the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare.One of those 37 Democrats was Rep. Betty Sutton. GOP Rep. Jim Renacci, her opponent in Ohio's newly redrawn 16th congressional district, repeated the claim the next day in a campaign fundraising email. We all know that our seniors were slapped with an estimated $500 billion blow to Medicare in 2010 when President Obama and Betty Sutton pushed through their healthcare law, which ended Medicare as we know it, the message said. Now, revised estimates by the Congressional Budget Office reveal Democrats gutted even more from Medicare than we first knew, taking $741 billion from seniors to fund ObamaCare. PolitiFact Ohio was interested.We have examined the claim that health care reform cuts Medicare by $500 billion on a number of occasions. The most recent was last May, when Renacci's campaign website said Sutton gutted Medicare by $500 billion to fund Obamacare.How did the claim climb from $500 billion to $741 billion?Renacci's email said: Revised estimates by the Congressional Budget Office reveal Democrats gutted even more from Medicare than we first knew, taking $741 billion from seniors to fund Obamacare.We asked Renacci's campaign how he backs up the statement. Except for the revised estimate from the Congressional Budget Office, the backup matched the sourcing for the earlier claim with $500 billion.Let's review, with the revised estimate.First, Obamacare does not literally cut a dollar amount from the Medicare programs budget. Rather, spending will grow.But the health care law instituted a number of changes to slow the programs future spending growth and try to contain future health care costs in the program. At the time the law was passed, those savings amounted to $500 billion over the next 10 years.At the time the health care law was being finalized and passed, Democrats said it was important to them that the new law not add to the deficit. So savings in Medicare spending were counted against the health care laws new spending. That spending is primarily to cover the uninsured, by giving them tax credits to buy private insurance. But some new spending increases Medicare coverage for prescription drugs for seniors.The efforts to limit future growth were mainly aimed at insurance companies and hospitals, not beneficiaries.The law makes significant changes to Medicare Advantage, a subset of Medicare plans run by private insurers. Medicare Advantage was started under President George W. Bush, and the idea was that competition among the private insurers would reduce costs. But in recent years the plans have actually cost more than traditional Medicare. So the health care law scales back the payments to private insurers.Hospitals, too, will be paid less if they have too many re-admissions, or if they fail to meet other new benchmarks for patient care.Obama and fellow Democrats say the intention is to protect beneficiaries' coverage while forcing health care providers to become more efficient.Under the new law, the overall Medicare budget is projected to go up for the foreseeable future. The health care law tries to limit that growth, making it less than it would have been without the law, but not reducing its overall budget.Because Medicare spending gets bigger every year, the figure for the savings also increases. Also, it takes a few years for the health care laws savings mechanisms to kick in. In fact, the effects of time are the main reason the $500 billion number has risen past $700 billion.The CBO determined in 2011 that the federal health care law would reduce Medicare outlays by $507 billion between 2012 and 2021. In its latest estimate released last month, the budget office looked at the years 2013 to 2022 and determined the health care law would reduce future Medicare spending by $716 billion. The $741 billion cited by the RNCC and Renacci includes that Medicare spending and money for other federal programs.So it is timing that's making the figures bigger, not changes to Medicare. The claim that Democrats support gutting Medicare is wrong -- program spending will still increase under Obamacare, but at a slower pace.There is an element of truth in Renaccis claim. The health care law seeks to reduce future Medicare spending, and the tally of those cost reductions over the next 10 years is $716 billion.But describing those savings as cuts that gut Medicare suggests a slashing of programs that is not in the law.On the Truth-O-Meter, the claim rates Mostly False.",0.2,0.9,0.8,0.5,0.4,0.8,0.6,0.7,0.3,mostly-false

During a campaign event in Stuart, Fla., on Jan. 28, 2012, Newt Gingrich said college students are taking too long to graduate.Students take fewer classes per semester. They take more years to get through. Why? Because they have free money, Gingrich said. I would tell students: Get through as quick as you can. Borrow as little as you can. Have a part-time job. But thats very different from the culture that has grown up in the last 20 years.We wondered whether the statistics showed that students are indeed taking longer to graduate than they did in the past. So we looked into it.We turned to figures on post-secondary education compiled by the National Center for Education Statistics, a division of the U.S. Department of Education. As it turns out, the trend for four-year colleges is exactly the opposite.Percent of bachelors degree-seeking students completing bachelor's degrees within four years after start, at all four-year institutions So the percentage of students completing degrees within four years has actually risen incrementally in recent years. Between the graduating classes of 2000 and 2006, the percentage of students graduating in four years increased by one-sixth.So where four-year colleges are concerned, Gingrichs comment is off the mark. But Gingrich has a point in regard to two-year institutions.Percent completing certificates or associate's degrees within 150 percent of normal time, all two-year institutions So for two-year institutions, the rate did fall slightly, though by less than what the rate for four-year institutions rose.Christopher Swanson, the vice president for research and development at Editorial Projects in Education, the publisher of Education Week, said that in general, education experts havent been worried so much that the trendlines for college completion are going in the wrong direction. The main narrative you hear about (concerns) the low completion rates in general, he said. On that score, he said, there doesnt seem to be a whole lot to write home about.Swanson did take issue with the general tenor of Gingrichs comments -- that you should borrow as little as you can and instead get a job if you want to increase the likelihood that youll finish college on time.That seems to fly in the face of what I think is a pretty well-established finding from the research that working during college or post-secondary education tends to be detrimental in terms of completion (that is, that youre less likely to complete) and time to completion (that it takes longer), Swanson said. There may be any number of issues and problems with excessive student borrowing, but being able to borrow for college does allow students the opportunity to focus more exclusively on their school work than would probably have been the case otherwise. If you follow the dont borrow/get a job argument and play that out a bit, that sounds a lot like what happens as a matter of course in community colleges. And the completion rates there are extremely low, on the order of one-third completing within an extended timeline.Our rulingGingrich said that students today take more years to get through college. While graduation rates are lower than experts would like them to be, it's not true that students are taking longer to graduate from four-year institutions. The percentage graduating on time at four-year colleges has actually risen consistently in recent years. The only exception to this pattern is at two-year colleges, where the percentage of students graduating within three years has fallen slightly. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/670cf7ee-39a3-41a7-9d3a-e6c3459864a0",0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,mostly-false

Final Rating: Mostly False  ",There arent enough ballots in question to change the outcome of the Harris vs. McCready race in NCCongressional District 9.,"The North Carolina elections board is investigating voting irregularities in the congressional race between Republican Mark Harris and Democrat Dan McCready. The race was expected to be among the closest in the country and unofficial results put Harris ahead of McCready by 905 votes. But the N.C. State Board of Elections and Ethics Enforcement on Nov. 30 declined to certify those results after the legitimacy of some ballots from Bladen County area were called into question. The N.C. Republican Party has urged the elections board to certify the results, despite the fact that the boards investigation isnt complete. The reality is that there arent enough ballots in question to change the outcome of this election, the NC GOP said in anemail to media outlets on Dec. 2. Dallas Woodhouse, executive director of the NC GOP, made the same claim in a press conference on Dec. 1. It is mathematically impossible for there to be enough mail-in ballots that can be in question in Bladen County to turn this race, Woodhouse said. His remarks can be found around the 11:45 mark ofthis WRAL video. Is it true there arent enough ballots in question to change the outcome of the election? In Bladen County, there were only 569 unreturned absentee mail-in ballots, Woodhouse said in an e-mail to PolitFact on Monday night. Moreover, 175 of these voters actually cast a ballot by another method. This leaves only 394 truly unreturned ballots in Bladen County, certainly not enough ballots to change the result of the election with a margin of 905 votes. Woodhouse has a point that theres a gap between the number of absentee-by-mail votes in Bladen County (an unofficial total of 684 for all candidates, combined) and the 905 total votes by which McCready trails Harris. However, the NC GOP claim gives the misleading impression that the mail-in ballots counted in Bladen County are the only ones in question by the NC elections board. Thats not the case. What the elections board has said Woodhouse has criticized the lack of transparency around the investigation, and hes right that the NC elections board has revealed little about the case in the 9th Congressional District, which runs from Charlotte eastward past Fayetteville along the South Carolina border. The board has released two public statements about the investigation. On Nov. 27, the board announced in a statement that it wasnt certifying the results. In his motion, Board Vice Chairman Joshua Malcolm cited the Boards authority underG.S. 163A-1180as the reason for delaying certification of that contest, the statement says. That statute gives the Board the authority to take any other action necessary to assure that an election is determined without taint of fraud or corruption and without irregularities that may have changed the result of an election.  Then, on Nov. 30, the board announced its intention to hold a public evidentiary hearing into claims of irregularities and fraudulent activities related to absentee by-mail voting and potentially other matters in the 9th Congressional District contest. The NC elections board cited the Bladen irregularities as a reason for not certifying the Harris-McCready contest results, but the statement didnt say investigators would limit their review to that county alone. The elections board hasnt publicly disclosed: Questions remain not only about mail-in ballots that were returned and counted, but also about ballots that were requested but never returned. First, lets look at the mail-in ballots that were counted. Unusual voting trends Eight counties are wholly or partly included in the district and Bladen was the only county in the district in which Harris had more mail-in support than McCready. (Unofficial results can be found on theNC elections board website.) In six of the counties, fewer than 3 percent of total votes were absentee-by-mail ballots, according to aFiveThirtyEightnews analysis of NC elections board data. But in Bladen County, that number was 7.3 percent, suggesting a push to get people there to vote by mail, FiveThirtyEight reported. Harris won 61 percent of the votes from mail-in ballots in Bladen County — even though registered Republicansaccounted for only 19 percentof the countys accepted absentee ballots, an independent analysis by Catawba College political scientist Michael Bitzer showed. Harriss Bladen County support stands out from the Republican primary, too. In May, Harris beat incumbent Rep. Robert Pittenger by 828 votes and was aided by a 400-vote advantage by absentee by-mail ballots in Bladen County. That figure is more than double the mail-in total in most other 9th District counties. And Bladen was the only county where Harris had a substantial absentee by-mail advantage over Pittenger. Back to the general election. Bladen County had the highest percentage of absentee ballot requests in the state, according to theCharlotte Observer. However, the number of unreturned ballots have raised eyebrows. Unreturned ballots On average, about 16 percent of registered voters who request mail-in ballots never return them, according to Bitzer. In the Harris-McCready district, the non-return rate was 24 percent. In Bladen County alone, 40 percent of the requested mail-in ballots were never returned. And in neighboring Robeson County, 60 percent were never returned, according to aNews & Observer review. The N&O found that the unreturned ballots are disproportionately associated with minority voters. In terms of actual votes, Bitzer reported that 495 ballots were requested but never returned in Bladen and 1,180 were requested but never returned in Robeson. AsFiveThirtyEightnoted, Robeson had more unreturned ballots than Mecklenburg County (home to Charlotte) despite Mecklenburg casting three times as many total votes as Robeson. Its certainly possible that some people requested ballots and then lost their ballot or moved or forgot to vote. The elections board is likely to review the situation. Steve Stone, chairman of the Robeson County Board of Elections, told The Washington Post that state investigators have requested information the county board kept on an unusual number of absentee ballot requests. County residents reported to the Robeson board that people were going door-to-door telling voters that their registrations had been dropped and they needed to re-register, Stone told the Post. Its illegal to take someone elses mail-in ballot and turn it inunless youre related to them. Yet, a few voters filed affidavits with the NC board of elections stating that they were approached in their homes by someone claiming to be a ballot collector. Much to be determined Monday night, NC elections board spokesman Pat Gannon emailed PolitiFact to clarify the scope of the investigation. The easy answer is that the scope is absentee voting irregularities in the 9th CD, Gannons email said. Investigators will go where the evidence takes them, including ballots not returned. We dont know whether there are enough ballots in question. Thats part of what the investigation is trying to determine. Ultimately, the exact number of altered votes and destroyed ballots may be irrelevant, according to Bitzer and Gerry Cohen, former special counsel to the N.C. General Assembly and longtime legislative staffer. In separate emails to PolitiFact, they pointed to NC General Statutes Section 163A-1181 with regards to New elections. The law says the state elections board can order a new election by majority vote if irregularities or improprieties occurred to such an extent that they taint the results of the entire election and cast doubt on its fairness. Our ruling The NC GOP says there arent enough ballots in question to change the outcome of this election. Theres a gap between the number of mail-in votes cast in Bladen County (684) and the 905 votes by which McCready trails Harris. But its possible -- if not likely -- that the NC elections board is examining more than just the absentee-by-mail ballots that were cast. The board hasnt publicly defined the scope of its investigation. Investigators could be examining the 684 mail-votes from Bladen County, the 680 mail-in votes from Robeson County, as well as the combined 1,675 mail-in ballots that werent returned from either county. The N.C. GOP hasnt presented evidence to prove that the NC elections board is focusing solely on the mail-in ballots that were already counted in Bladen County. In fact, theyve criticized the board for lacking transparency. We believe Woodhouse and the NC GOPs claim meets the definition of aMostly False claim: it contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.",0.5,0.5,1.0,0.5,0.0,0.5,0.5,1.0,0.5,mostly-false

Final Rating: Mostly False  ","Wisconsin's Lincoln Hills youth prison has a 66 percent recidivism rate, while states like Missouri, that have more of a regional model -- 8 percent.","For two years, Wisconsins youth prison for males has been under an FBI-led criminal investigation into allegations of prisoner abuse, child neglect, sexual assault, intimidation of witnesses and victims, strangulation and tampering with public records. Should the facility, Lincoln Hills School, be shut down? That question was posed to Wisconsin Assembly Minority Leader Gordon Hintz in an interview on Nov. 21, 2017, the day after the Oshkosh Democrat toured Lincoln Hills. Responding to Wisconsin Eye TV host Steven Walters, Hintz said an alternative would have to be developed first. Then he made a statement that seemed to indict the facility, saying: We have a 66 percent recidivism rate for the kids there, in the three years after they get out. States like Missouri, that have more of a regional model -- 8 percent. So, 66 percent of Lincoln Hills inmates commit new offenses within three years of being released? And thats eight times higher than in states such as Missouri, which has been held up as a potential model for Wisconsin? Well see that, as national experts have stated, comparing states on juvenile recidivism is not easily done. The trouble at Lincoln Hills Lincoln Hills generally holds inmates as young as 13 and as old as 25, with most inmates in their mid-to late-teens; some adults are being held for crimes they committed as juveniles. Incarcerating an inmate there costs more than $100,000 a year. Groups such as Youth Justice Milwaukee, which is calling for Wisconsins youth prisons to be closed, argue that conditions at Lincoln Hills can lead to higher recidivism -- inmates committing new offenses after theyre released. Milwaukee County Executive Chris Abele has gone even further than Hintz, saying 75 percent of Lincoln Hills inmates fall back into criminal activity. Meanwhile, Missouri -- when facing problems similar to those at Lincoln Hills, such as fights between inmates, long stints in solitary confinement and injuries inflicted by guards -- replaced large institutions with small facilities, closer to young offenders' homes. But the contrast in recidivism between the two states is not how Hintz portrays it. Hintzs partially accurate evidence To back Hintzs claim, his office cited a January 2017 report by the nonpartisan Wisconsin Legislative Fiscal Bureau. It says that according to the latest available data, Lincoln Hills has a three-year recidivism rate of 63 percent. That is, 278 juveniles were released from Lincoln Hills in 2011 and 63 percent returned to either a juvenile correctional facility or an adult prison, or were placed on probation for a new offense, by 2014. So, Hintzs claim of a 66 percent recidivism rate at Lincoln Hills is high by only three percentage points. Missouris definition of recidivism is roughly similar to Wisconsins, but has four parts. It includes youths who are sent back to the juvenile system, are sent to adult prison, are put on probation, or are put into a 120-day program. But the latest State of Missouri figures show Missouris three-year recidivism rate, for 2013 to 2016, is 30 percent. Thats far less than Lincoln Hills 63 percent. But its also much higher than the 8 percent Hintz claimed. That lower rate applies only to the first part of Missouris recidivism definition -- youths who commit new offenses and are sent back to the youth system. Apples and oranges There are also other problems with comparing Lincoln Hills to Missouri: Lincoln Hills Missouri Latest three-year recidivism rate is 2011-2014 Latest recidivism rate is 2013-2016 Only male inmates Male and female offenders Inmates have committed serious, violent crimes — including homicide and robbery — or have had repeated run-ins with the law and didnt turn their behavior around after being sent to group homes. Youths have committed a wide variety of offenses, from serious felonies to truancy and curfew violations. Those create a major apples-to-oranges problem for Hintzs statement, particularly the fact Missouris count includes many less serious offenders than Lincoln Hills. Our rating Hintz says Wisconsin's Lincoln Hills youth prison has a 66 percent recidivism rate, while states like Missouri, that have more of a regional model -- 8 percent. He is essentially correct on Wisconsin. The latest figures show that 63 percent of Lincoln Hills offenders are returned to either a juvenile correctional facility or an adult prison, or were placed on probation for a new offense, within three years of being released. But the comparison to Missouri misses on several counts. Missouri reports a three-year youth recidivism rate of 30 percent, not 8 percent -- and even that is misleading. While Lincoln Hills incarcerates only serious male offenders, Missouris youth correctional system includes males and females who commit offenses ranging from serious crimes to truancy. So, Hintz is comparing two significantly different populations. Hintzs statement contains an element of truth, but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression -- our definition of Mostly False.

Final Rating: Mostly False  ",The United States cant import baby formula because of the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement.,"A recent Twitter post claimed the United States trade policy with its North American neighbors is the reason why theres a shortage of baby formula nationwide. Why cant we just import baby formula? the May 14 tweet said. Ever heard of the United States Canada Mexico Agreement? That bit of legislation Trump and Republicans proudly replaced NAFTA with? Remember Trump bragging about that? Remember? That. That's why. We found a similar claim on Facebook. The post was flagged as part of Facebooks efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement, which officially replaced the North American Free Trade Agreement in July 2020, did overhaul the countrys trade policies with Canada and Mexico. But claiming that trade agreement is the sole reason the U.S. cant import baby formula vastly oversimplifies the issue. The U.S. can import baby formula, but in a typical year, about 98% of the infant formula consumed in the U.S. is domestically produced. Only a small amount of formula is imported from other countries, such as Mexico, Ireland, the Netherlands, Chile and Austria. The importation of baby formula is subject to high tariffs and complex policies that aim to protect the U.S. dairy industry from competitors and ensure that formula is safe to consume. Domestic and foreign manufacturers alike must adhere to government regulations and undergo review by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in order to have their products approved for sale in the U.S. The FDA requires baby formula to meet certain ingredient and nutrition requirements, and the products must follow specific labeling guidelines. For instance, the labels must be in English, except in areas where English is not the predominant language. Once a baby formula product receives FDA approval, retailers must then wait 90 days before marketing it. Its a very heavily involved regulatory process, which is why its difficult to import baby formula, said Gabby Beaumont-Smith, a policy analyst at the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank. The U.S. also requires foreign companies importing baby formula to pay tariffs of up to 17.5%. Additional duties can be placed on formula imports if they exceed a certain amount. These tariffs, as well as the FDA regulations, existed before the USMCA was adopted. But the new trade deal did make some changes to the importation of baby formula from Canada and Mexico. Provisions in the trade agreement limit how much baby formula Canada can export globally each year and impose charges if the exports exceed a certain amount. Currently, if Canadian businesses export more than 40,480 metric tons collectively, they would be subject to an export charge of $4.25 (Canadian dollars) per kilogram. The U.S. didnt import any baby formula from Canada in 2021. This limit was imposed at U.S. authorities'insistencebecause there was concern before the new trade deal that Canada was dumping powdered milk products, which includes baby formula, said Andrew Novaković, a professor of agricultural economics at Cornell University. Dumping is when a country or company persistently sells their product to a foreign buyer at a price considered to be at a loss, usually for the purpose of simply gaining market share or punishing their foreign competitor, Novaković said. Meanwhile, under the USMCA, Mexico is one of the few U.S. trading partners that can import baby formula duty-free. Only a small amount of baby formula, roughly 12,000 metric tons, was imported from Mexico last year, according to the U.S. International Trade Commission. On May 16, the FDA announced new guidance on the importation of baby formula to help increase the availability of the product in stores across the U.S. The FDA is prioritizing manufacturers that have the largest volume of product available, can get their products onto shelves the quickest, and can demonstrate their product meets the agencys safety and nutrition standards. Social media posts claimed that the U.S. cant import baby formula due to the USMCA replacing NAFTA. Importing baby formula to the U.S. is allowed, although these imports usually only make up about 2% of all baby formula consumption in the country. The USMCA did make some changes to how baby formula is imported to the U.S., but many other regulatory policies affect imports, too. The trade agreement is not the only barrier to the U.S. importing more formula.",0.3,0.8,0.9,0.4,0.1,0.6,0.7,0.9,0.5,mostly-false

Final Rating: Mostly False  ","Seven hundred thousand. Thats how many California jobs will be lost thanks to the politicians raising the minimum wage.Now Florida is adding one million jobs, not losing them.","Florida Gov. Rick Scott is not on board with the minimum wage increase in the sunny, oceanside state — of California. As Scott toured the West Coast for the second time attempting to attract businesses, Enterprise Florida (the states public-private economic development arm) ran radio ads in San Francisco and Los Angeles attacking Californias $15 wage and trumpeting Floridas superior job prospects. Seven hundred thousand. Thats how many California jobs will be lost thanks to the politicians raising the minimum wage, the ad says, as the Miami Herald reports. Ready to leave California? Go to Florida instead — no state income tax, and Gov. Scott has cut regulations. Now Florida is adding 1 million jobs, not losing them. California Gov. Jerry Brown didnt take this lying down, penning a letter welcoming Scott back to California, a state that in the last year has added more jobs than Florida and Texas combined, and not-so-subtly suggested Scott worry about more pressing matters back home. Rick, a fact youd like to ignore: California is the 7th largest economic power in the world. Were competing with nations like Brazil and France, not states like Florida, Brown wrote on May 2. If youre truly serious about Floridas economic well-being, its time to stop the silly political stunts and start doing something about climate change – two words you wont even let state officials say. The threat is real and so too will be the devastating impacts. Here, well look at Scotts claim that California will lose almost as many jobs as Florida will gain. The ad is comparingCalifornia's projected employment with Florida's past performance — an apples-to-oranges comparison.Italso distorts what the 700,000 jobs-lost figure actually refers to. Even with the wage hike, California is expected to gain more jobs than Florida over the next decade, albeit not as many as without it. Furthermore, all the economists we spoke with cautioned against pinning a figure to the minimum wage hikes impact on employment in California. All that glitters in Golden State jobs A spokesperson for Scott cited a post by American Action Forum, a self-described center-right policy institute, as the source of the 700,000 lost jobs. But the figure doesnt refer to a decline in the total number jobs in the state, as the ad suggests. Rather, its the difference between the number of jobs that California could have gained without and with the wage hike. California will gradually increase the current $10 hourly minimum wage to $15 by 2022. According to the institute's labor market policy director, Ben Gitis, that will lead to a 3.5 percent decrease in employment growth or about 692,235 jobs by 2026 that could have been added if the wage did not increase. Gitis walked us through his math. He used the California Employment Development Departments latest 10-year forecast, which projects that the state will add 14.9 percent or 2.3 million more jobs from 2012 to 2022. Gitis then calculated the impact of the minimum wage hike; he concluded that California would see its projected 2026 jobs numbers reduced by 3.5 percent. In other words, California would have added about 3.4 million new jobs from 2012 to 2026 without the hike, but 2.7 million with it. So the state isnt so much losing 700,000 jobs as forgoing them, said Jeremy West, an economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who co-authored the Journal of Human Resources study Gitis used for his calculations. Bright employment outlook in Sunshine State Scotts office forwarded us a press release that says Florida has added more than a million jobs since 2010, a claim that PolitiFact Florida rated Mostly True. But Scott was talking about future projections for California, so well look instead at the number of jobs Florida will gain in the same time frame as Gitis analysis. From 2012 to 2026, Florida is actually projected to add more than a million jobs. The increase, however, will still be less than Californias. (We would be remiss to not mention that Californias cost of living is higherthan Florida's and its population size is almost twice as big.But as Enterprise Florida touted raw employment numbers, well follow suit.) Florida added about 552,000 jobs from Dec. 2012 to Dec. 2015. According to the Florida Dept. of Economic Opportunity, the state will gain 1.1 million more jobs from 2015 to 2023. Thats a compounded annual growth rate of 1.5 percent, equal to about 445,000new jobs from 2023 to 2026. Put it all together, Florida will add 2.1million jobs from 2012 to 2026. Thats still 600,000 fewerjobs than California will add in the same time frame with the $15 wage. Waging in uncharted waters As we have previously reported, theres a great amount of debate over the effect that minimum wage hikes have job growth. A spokesperson for Brown forwarded usacademic and think-tank studies showing that past increases have had little or no effect on employment. Californias hike, however, is so unprecedented that past research may be less relevant. All the experts we spoke with suspect it will reduce employment. An increase the size of Californias is outside of the experience of any state over the last four decades, said Jonathan Meer, a Texas A&M University economist and co-author of the study Gitis cited. A dramatic increase in the minimum wage like Californias will undoubtedly reduce employment. However, I would be very cautious about putting any precise figures on the amount. Two home-state economists — Jeffrey Clemens of the University of California, San Diego and David Neumark of the University of California, Irvine — agreed that the huge wage hike will likely cause job losses, but the magnitude is uncertain.  The recently passed minimum wage increases are sufficiently beyond the range of historical experience that I do not think it is possible to predict their effects on employment with any precision, Clemens said. Neumark added that Scotts job-poaching mission is nonetheless ill-fated, given that the flow of jobs into or out of California is typically miniscule and the jobs most affected by hike (low-skill jobs in the service and agricultural sectors) are hard to move out of state. Maybe a few low-wage manufacturers will move. But there's no reason to expect they'd go to Florida more than many other low-wage states or overseas, so I suspect the employment growth in Florida from Californias minimum wage increase would be negligible, and statistically undetectable, Neumark said. So Gov. Scott is probably wasting his and his Florida taxpayers' time. Our ruling A radio ad by Enterprise Florida said, Seven hundred thousand. Thats how many California jobs will be lost thanks to the politicians raising the minimum wage.Now Florida is adding 1 million jobs, not losing them. This is misleading. The 700,000 figure refers to the number of jobs California could have added by 2026 if it didnt increase the minimum wage, not a decline in net employment. Based on projections, California will still gain more jobs with the minimum wage increase than Florida during the same time frame. While experts agreed that a $15 wage will reduce employment in California, they said its near impossible to pin a number on the impact given how unprecedented the hike is.

Final Rating: Mostly False","There is a consensus among economists left, right, and center that we cant spend too much on COVID-19 relief.","President Joe Biden has made beating the coronavirus and repairing the economic damage it unleashed his defining priorities. The central pillar of his strategy is a $1.9 trillion recovery plan. At a CNN town hall in Milwaukee, host Anderson Cooper asked Biden if he was committed to passing a $1.9 trillion bill, or if the number was up for negotiation. Biden responded as though there was no need for discussion. He said support for his package came from economists left, right and center. The overwhelming consensus is: In order to grow the economy a year or two, three, and four down the line, we cant spend too much, Biden said Feb. 16. Now is the time we should be spending. Now is the time to go big. Economists across the political spectrum have indeed embraced delivering substantial relief, but when it comes to the total price tag, theres more debate than he describes. Including among Democrats. In early February, former Obama administration Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers voiced concerns. In a Washington Post op-ed, Summers warned that while the bill had to be big, there was a risk of overshoot. Spending too much on COVID-19, Summers said, would squeeze out money for other big plans, from infrastructure to renewable energy to preschool. After resolving the coronavirus crisis, how will political and economic space be found for the public investments that should be the nations highest priority? Summers wrote. Summers was not alone. The former chief economist for the International Monetary Fund, Olivier Blanchard, said $1.9 trillion was too much. Blanchard agreed with the plans main goals — spending on vaccines and health care, protecting the people who lost jobs and boosting demand. But Blanchard didnt reach Bidens total. When you make the sum of all these needs, which are real and have to be satisfied, you don't get to $1.9 trillion. You get to a smaller number, Blanchard said Feb. 8. Blanchards ballpark number was $1 trillion. Desmond Lachman, an economist at the American Enterprise Institute, a market-oriented think tank, agreed that there is consensus across the ideological spectrum in favor of additional economic stimulus. The supporters include Lachmans onetime colleague at the institute Kevin Hassett, who joined the Trump administration as the chair of the Council of Economic Advisers. Hassett told CNN that he broadly supports Bidens $1.9 trillion package. But Lachman said theres uneven support for that level of spending. There are many economists who think that a package as large as a $1.9 trillion package is inviting trouble, Lachman said. Lachman, like the other more cautious economists, worries about overheating the economy with too much cash. The resulting inflation would lead to higher interest rates, which, Lachman argues, would send world financial markets into a tailspin. Ever eager to foster stability, the U.S. Federal Reserve offered calming words on that front. Chairman Jerome Powell said Feb. 10 that if a burst of spending drives prices up, he doesnt think it would last, nor would it automatically trigger a rate increase. A recent survey puts some numbers to the range of opinions among economists. In January, the Wall Street Journal asked over 60 economists how much stimulus is needed. A bit more than half said less than $1 trillion would do. Just under half preferred an amount between $1 trillion and $2 trillion. Now, this was strictly a question about economic stimulus. Bidens plan includes about $160 billion for coronavirus programs, and other pieces might come under the same umbrella. But at some top-line level, economists disagree over the size of the proposal. Jason Furman, chair of the Council of Economic Advisers in the Obama administration, suggested making theBiden plan more flexible. If economic growth remained weak after some initial stimulus, Furman would extend the aid for a longer time. If not, the government could dial back its spending. These provisions could also phase out aid more quickly than Mr. Biden proposes if the economy rebounds faster than expected, Furman wrote Jan. 25, 2021. Samuel Hammond with the Niskanen Center, a group named after an economic adviser to President Ronald Reagan, joined over 120 economists in a letter that called for substantial relief. But Hammond said he agrees with the concerns raised by Summers, and has reservations about a major part of the Biden plan: $350 billion for state and local governments. I think Larry (Summers) has been making some decent points about COVID relief, and the longer-term benefits of prioritizing public investments rather than a ton of state and local fiscal aid, Hammond said. The White House press office staff noted that support has come from top Democratic and Republican economists, and they pointed to statements from leading business groups such as the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the Business Roundtable. But while those statements push for strong action, they are not specific about a dollar figure. We look forward to working with the new administration and Congress on the details and in ensuring that any additional economic assistance is timely, targeted, and temporary,  the Chamber of Commerce said Jan. 14. That leaves plenty of room for discussion about the scale of the relief package. Biden said that economists across the political spectrum supported his COVID-19 relief proposal. There is broad agreement that Washington should spend hundreds of billions of dollars to corral the coronavirus, help small businesses and give assistance to the millions of people who lost their jobs. But Biden treated that support as an endorsement of his entire $1.9 trillion plan. Many prominent economists have concerns about the price tag, which was the exact focus of the question Biden was answering. He glossed over that debate.",0.4,0.6,0.8,0.5,0.2,0.5,0.7,0.9,0.4,mostly-false

Final Rating: Mostly False  ","Of those 850,000 (new Texas) jobs, most were public-sector jobs and minimum-wage jobs.","Gov. Rick Perry frequently crows about the Texas economy, lately saying that in his near-decade as governor, Texas has gained more than 850,000 jobs. In an Oct. 15 interview, Perry's Democratic opponent didn't challenge that number. However, Bill White told the Texas Tribune: Of those 850,000 jobs, most were public-sector jobs and minimum-wage jobs. Huh. We hadn't heard that. Katy Bacon, White's spokeswoman, later said that White thinks that being able to attract high-wage jobs is crucial to the state's long-term economic growth. In 2009, 474,000 Texas workers — 8.5 percent of the hourly work force — earned the federal minimum wage or less, according to a March 11 news release from the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics. That was the highest proportion of low-wage earners in the 50 states and the District of Columbia, the release said. We wondered how many of those jobs were created on Perry's watch, per White's claim that most of the employment gains touted by the governor were jobs that paid minimum wage or were in the public sector. First, some background: The 850,000 figure touted by Perry and dissected by White reflects the net increase in nonfarm jobs in the state from January 2001, soon after Perry became governor, through June 2010 (actual gain = 853,400). However, updated statistics show that through August, the net jobs gained had decreased to 818,500. We also noted that the Texas State Data Center has projected that the Texas population grew by about 4 million between 2001 and 2010. When asked to back up White's breakdown of the job gains, the White campaign provided a spreadsheet of calculations using bureau data to show the rise in both government-sector jobs and minimum-wage jobs in Texas. The campaign looked at several time periods, including the one favored by the Perry campaign, January 2001 to June 2010, and others that incorporated the most recent data available, through August 2010. In an accompanying letter, Tom McCasland, a research analyst for White's campaign, said their calculations showed that government and minimum-wage jobs accounted for 62.8 percent to 69.5 percent of the total job gains. For the time period corresponding to the 850,000 figure (January 2001 to June 2010), the relevant portion of the job gains was 67.5 percent, according to McCasland's information. But in reviewing their math, we found several wrinkles: 1) The bureau's information on public sector and minimum-wage jobs come from different sources that gather data at different time intervals, said Cheryl Abbot, the bureau's regional economist in Dallas. The employment information by sector is compiled monthly while the minimum-wage job situation is examined annually. In this case, that means the time periods for the two categories don't match exactly. 2) Our calculation of the increase in minimum-wage jobs in Texas during Perry's tenure (259,000) didn't match White's (267,000). Why the discrepancy? We used the bureau's most recent information to compare the number of minimum-wage jobs in Texas in 2001 and 2009. McCasland said he had used older bureau information and had compared 2002 with 2009. 3) Another issue: The federal minimum wage increased three times between 2001, when it was $5.15 an hour, and 2010 — rising to $5.85 in 2007, to $6.55 in 2008, and to $7.25 in 2009. These stair-step jumps brought some above-minimum wage jobs down into the minimum-wage-or-below fold. During the years the minimum wage held steady at $5.15 (1998-2006), the number of Texas workers making at or below that amount actually declined slightly, except for a small uptick in 2003. From 2006 to 2009, Abbot said, just over 300,000 more Texans entered that low-paid category. However, we have no way of determining if those are actually 'new jobs' or, more likely, workers whose pay rate is now equal to or below the increased federal minimum wage, she said. That's a fair point, McCasland said. Then he made one of his own: Because Gov. Perry continues to talk about net job creation, it is appropriate to look at how many of those net jobs end up as minimum-wage jobs, either because they were created as such or because they become minimum-wage jobs by failing to keep up with inflation. Lastly, we realized White's calculations assume that government jobs and minimum-wage jobs are entirely separate categories; what if there's overlap and White counted some jobs twice? Abbot told us that's possible but that there's no way to know because the bureau doesn't have data broken down that way. The best I can tell you is that at the national level — which may or may not represent Texas at all — among all hourly-paid public sector workers, 2.3 percent were paid at or below the prevailing minimum wage in 2009, Abbot said. Texas Workforce Commission spokeswoman Ann Hatchitt told us the commission doesn't keep detailed information on minimum-wage workers in Texas, including how many are in the public sector. What we know: Texas added 853,400 jobs from January 2001 through June 2010. Of those, 308,800 were government jobs. That's about 36 percent. To prove White's statement that most (more than 50 percent) of the new jobs were public-sector and minimum wage, an additional 117,901 would have had to be jobs that paid at or below minimum wage. But we can't calculate that because the bureau's count of minimum-wage jobs doesn't discriminate between brand-new jobs and pre-existing ones that were swept into the count when the minimum wage went up. We asked experts including University of Texas economist Daniel Hamermesh and Bruce Kellison, associate director of UT's Bureau of Business Research, whether we could make a ballpark estimate of how many of the job gains under Perry were minimum wage. Each of them said nope, primarily because employment data doesn't break it out. Summing up: White's campaign presented raw numbers suggesting that about two-thirds of the jobs added on Perry's watch were either government-sector or minimum-wage. But that methodology lacks critical information that could easily lead to a different conclusion. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published.

Final Rating: Mostly False  ",COVID cases in India plummet after government promotes ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine use.,"On May 17, the New York Times reported that the coronavirus crisis was so severe in India, with about 23 million infections confirmed, that the country was accounting for more than half of the worlds daily COVID-19 cases. The same day, The Gateway Pundit posted a story suggesting that two drugs — both of which have drawn warnings from U.S. and global public health officials not to be used for COVID-19 — were having dramatic effects in India. The headline, widely shared on Facebook, read: Elites Worried: COVID Cases in India Plummet After Government Promotes Ivermectin and Hydroxychloroquine Use. The post was flagged as part of Facebooks efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Daily COVID-19 cases in India decreased in the days before May 17 — but only after a nearly vertical rise that started in April and peaked May 8. The Indian government has recommended limited use of the two drugs for COVID-19, but there is no evidence that their use led to the drop in cases. Neither drug is approved in the U.S. for COVID-19. And both the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and the World Health Organization recommend against using them to prevent or to treat COVID-19 infection. The Gateway Pundit article was written by the sites founder and editor-in-chief, Jim Hoft, whose Twitter account was permanently suspended in February for repeated violations of Twitters policies on election-related messages, according to news reports. The Gateway Pundit article links to another article that links to revised guidelines issued April 28 by Indias Ministry of Health & Family Welfare. The guidelines, for home isolation of mild/asymptomatic COVID-19 cases, recommends considering ivermectin as treatment for those patients, and says people in close contact with those patients should take hydroxychloroquine as a prevention as per protocol and as prescribed by the treating medical officer. Hoft did not respond to a request for evidence to support his claim. Confirmed new COVID-19 cases in India declined in the days before the article was posted, based on a seven-day rolling average — but only after reaching a peak following a sharp increase that started in April. The seven-day average of new daily cases was 319,497 on May 17, the date of the post, down from a peak of 391,232 on May 8, according to Our World in Data. The U.S. average was 32,036 on May 17. Many experts caution that the Indian governments official tallies of confirmed cases likely vastly underestimate the actual infection figures because testing remains limited and the volume of cases has crippled the health care system in some areas. So the actual extent of the decline is not clear. Hydroxychloroquine and ivermectin are being widely used in India for COVID-19, according to news reports. But there is no evidence they led to the recent decline in confirmed cases, given the lack of clear scientific evidence that they are effective at all in prevention or treatment. The governments new guidelines dont give a rationale for the recommendations. They were issued several days after a research paper was published that said results from numerous controlled prophylaxis trials, including some done in India, report significantly reduced risks of contracting COVID-19 with the regular use of ivermectin. Doctors in India admitted to have prescribed the drug under compulsion, peer pressure or on patients demand, according to one news report . The health minister in Goa was quoted as saying ivermectin does not prevent a COVID-19 infection, but helps in reducing the severity of the disease. Hydroxychloroquine has been in use much longer. In June 2020, a task force of Indias health ministry recommended that frontline health care workers take it to prevent COVID-19 infection. According to the journal Nature, the task force cited three new studies conducted by government agencies, only one of which had been published, that the task force said showed it can prevent infection. Leading U.S. and global health authorities recommend against using the two drugs for COVID-19. In March 2020, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration authorized emergency use of hydroxychloroquine, which is FDA-approved to treat or prevent malaria, for certain hospitalized COVID-19 patients. But the FDA revoked its authorization less than three months later, after determining it is no longer reasonable to believe that it may be effective in treating COVID-19, nor is it reasonable to believe that the known and potential benefits of these products outweigh their known and potential risks. The FDA continues to recommend against using it for COVID-19. In guidelines issued March 2 on drugs to prevent COVID-19, the World Health Organization said: We recommend against administering hydroxychloroquine prophylaxis to individuals who do not have COVID-19 — strong recommendation, high certainty evidence. And in guidelines issued March 31 on treating COVID-19, the organization gave a strong recommendation against hydroxychloroquine in patients with COVID-19 of any severity. In the treatment guidelines, the World Health Organization said: We recommend not to use ivermectin in patients with COVID-19 except in the context of a clinical trial, citing very low certainty evidence about the drug. The FDA, in an article March 5, said ivermectin should not be used to prevent or treat COVID-19. Ivermectin, which is FDA-approved to treat conditions caused by parasitic worms and parasites such as lice, in large doses is dangerous and can cause serious harm. An FDA posting April 26 noted that a June 2020 research article described the effect of ivermectin on the coronavirus in a laboratory setting, but that more testing is needed to determine whether ivermectin might be appropriate to prevent or treat coronavirus or COVID-19. Some limited studies suggest that ivermectin can help treat COVID-19; others show no significant impact. Many of the studies had small sample sizes and other limitations. It would therefore be premature to conclude absolutely that ivermectin has no place in COVID-19 treatment, Gordon Dent, a senior lecturer in pharmacology at Keele University School of Medicine in England, wrote in April. On the basis of current evidence, however, its use cannot be recommended. The Gateway Pundit claimed: COVID cases in India plummet after government promotes ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine use. COVID-19 cases in India, one of the worst-hit countries in the world by the coronavirus, dropped in mid-May only after a nearly vertical spike in cases over the previous several weeks. The Indian government has given limited recommendations for using the two drugs in connection with mild COVID-19 cases. There is no evidence that the two drugs caused or contributed to a decline in cases in India. Neither is approved in the U.S. for COVID-19. And both the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and the World Health Organization recommend against using them to prevent or to treat COVID-19 infections, citing lack of scientific evidence of their effectiveness and the potential for serious side effects.

Final Rating: Mostly False",New Zealand okays euthanasia for COVID patients.,"As COVID-19 cases continue to surge, the headline on a blog post claims New Zealand decided to approve euthanasia for COVID-19 patients. New Zealand okays euthanasia for COVID patients, reads the blogs headline, which was shared in numerous social media posts. Patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19 can die by euthanasia if doctors decide they might not survive, the New Zealand government has declared, said one tweet that drew a quote from the Catholic Herald article before offering commentary: Thatll certainly increase the numbers. Theres evil afoot. “Patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19 can die by euthanasia if doctors decide they might not survive, the New Zealand government has declared.”Thatll certainly increase the numbers.Theres evil afoot. https://t.co/ffGi5egSpL But the headline is a misrepresentation of an assisted dying program that recently went into effect in New Zealand — and social media posts referencing the news leave out significant context. Passed in a referendum by New Zealanders in 2020, the End of Life Choice Act of 2019 has strict eligibility requirements and is only meant for terminally ill people. It wasnt introduced for COVID-19 patients. The story was flagged as part of Facebooks efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more aboutour partnership with Facebook.) The law took effect in November 2021 about a year after the vote. In December, an anti-euthansia website called The Defender published an article that seemed to ignite the claims now circulating online. According to the article, the New Zealand Health Ministry told The Defender that, in some circumstances, a person with COVID-19 may be eligible for assisted dying, and suggested that the law could be used as a tool if COVID-19 hospitalizations were to spiral out of control. But New Zealand health officials said that the story and others like it are taking the law out of context and omitting its eligibility requirements and rules. There is no truth to claims that suggest the law was introduced for COVID-19, said Blair Cunningham, a spokesperson for the health agency. To be eligible for the program, a person must be 18 years or older and meet all of the following criteria: a citizen or permanent resident of New Zealand suffering from a terminal illness that is likely to end their life within six months in an advanced state of irreversible decline in physical capability experiencing unbearable suffering that cannot be relieved in a manner that the person considers tolerable competent to make an informed decision about assisted dying. Two doctors and, in some cases, a psychiatrist must assess whether a patient is eligible and whether the person is competent to make an informed decision. The legislation says that doctors cant suggest euthanasia as an option to the patient or make the decision for them. The patient alone must be the one to raise assisted dying with someone in their health care team. The services, Cunningham said, are most likely to be provided in a persons home or other community settings, rather than in hospital settings. The health agency added that a terminal illness is most often a prolonged disease where treatment is not effective and that, in some circumstances, a person with COVID-19 may be eligible for assisted dying. But because eligibility is determined case by case, the agency cannot make definitive statements about who is eligible. Blog posts and social media posts claim that New Zealand has approved euthansia for COVID-19 patients, with suggestions that it could be used as a tool if COVID-19 hospitalizations rise dramatically. An assisted-dying law was passed by New Zealand voters in 2020. But while some COVID-19 patients may be eligible under the law, the legislation was not introduced for COVID-19. The law has strict eligibility requirements, including that the person must have a terminal illness that is likely to end their life within six months and causes them unbearable suffering. It requires multiple doctors to determine whether the person is eligible and competent, and doctors cannot suggest euthanasia as an option or make the decision for patients. These stories are misleading and omit critical facts that would give a different impression. Mostly False.",0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,mostly-false

Final Rating: Mostly False  ","We would create thousands of jobs in Colorado, if the Keystone Pipeline were to be built.","President Barack Obamas indefinite delay of the Keystone XL pipeline has become a wedge issue between Democrats and Republicans as the midterm election season heats up. In the Colorado Senate race, Democratic Sen. Mark Udall recently voted against Congress fast-tracking the pipeline, but said the administrations review process should continue. His likely Republican opponent, U.S. Rep. Cory Gardner, has called for swift approval, insisting it would be an economic boon to the state. In an interview on Univision Radio, a primarily Spanish-language station, Gardner accused Senate Democrats of holding up the pipeline to placate environmentalists in an election year. The Keystone Pipeline would create good-paying jobs, Gardner said. Not only where the pipeline is being built, good-paying construction jobs, but manufacturing and service opportunities in Colorado along with the Keystone Pipeline. We would create thousands of jobs in Colorado, if the Keystone Pipeline were to be built. The planned route for the pipeline, which would connect diluted oil sands from Western Canada to Nebraska and then Gulf Coast refineries, doesnt go through Colorado. So we wondered if it was possible that thousands of jobs would be created by the pipeline there. We asked Gardners staff for the source of his claim. Spokesman Alex Siciliano pointed us to the written testimony of Gary Mar, who represented Alberta, Canada, in Washington and spoke at a House Energy and Commerce committee hearing in February 2011. Mar cites a 2009 study from the Canadian Energy Research Institute that estimates over 15 years the development of Albertas oil sands will boost U.S. GDP by an average of $31 billion per year, creating over 624,000 jobs in the U.S. We couldnt find the original study, but a chart Mar appended to his testimony says Colorado would see 11,200 jobs between 2009 and 2025, about half of which would have come between 2011 and 2015. The chart, however, looks at the economic impact of the entire Alberta oil sands on the United States, not just the Keystone XL pipeline. In a subsequent 2011 study, the Canadian Energy Research Institute claimed job growth as a result of the oil sands could reach 600,000 in the United States, but only if existing pipelines were expanded and other projects came to fruition. A spokeswoman for the Canadian Energy Research Institute also said those numbers did not look at the economic benefits of the pipeline, but only the benefits from upstream production of oil sands. Basically, its not measuring the benefit from the pipeline itself, rather the study estimates the effects of Canada being able to increase its capacity to produce oil. The study Siciliano showed us is also from 2009. As TransCanada, the company building the pipeline, told us previously, The project has changed considerably since then, including substantial route changes and a new presidential permit application. TransCanada has stopped touting its own study on the the economic benefits of the pipeline from from the same time period, which estimated about 20,000 manufacturing and construction jobs, and another 118,000 spin-off jobs. Instead, in an email to PolitiFact this week, TransCanada pointed us to the State Departments analysis of the project. According to that study, the Keystone XL pipeline would directly create the equivalent of 16,100 jobs if the project took one year. If the job lasted two years, the equivalent of 8,050 people would be employed over the course of the project. Of those jobs, 5,400 would be in states where the pipeline and support infrastructure will actually get built — Montana, South Dakota, Nebraska and Kansas. The rest of those direct jobs would be created in other states. In all, about 42,100 jobs would be created over the course of the project — 30,000 of which would be outside the aforementioned four states. This includes jobs created directly by the pipeline (like the construction work), indirectly (like jobs created as a result of goods and services purchased by construction crews) and induced (jobs created by workers spending their wages in the economy). How many of those 30,000 temporary jobs would be in Colorado? Its not clear from the State Department study, and a spokeswoman for the department said it wasnt available. Ian Goodman, who co-authored a Cornell University study of the pipeline, said its unlikely that Colorados chunk of those 30,000 jobs would reach the thousands. Though Colorado could see some benefits from being in a state proximate to the pipeline, it is not expected to be a major supplier to the construction. Most of these jobs would be in the states along the pipeline routing and most of the remainder would be in states heavily involved in the spin offs — pipeline supply chain and/or providing goods and services for Keystone XL workers, Goodman said. Colorado is not likely to have a big roles in these spin-offs. So it is hard to see how Colorado could be getting thousands of jobs from Keystone XL. Goodman also said TransCanada has already spent about one-third of the pipeline's budget on engineering, design, permitting, and equipment and materials already procured and manufactured. That means that some jobs and economic development from that part of the project have already been realized. In a rosy scenario, Goodman estimated that at most 1,400 additional jobs could be created in Colorado, but more likely it will be less, perhaps closer to 500. As weve noted in the past, too, almost all of these jobs are not permanent, as is often the case with construction projects. The State Department found the pipeline would create 35 permanent jobs and 15 temporary jobs once it went into operation. Our ruling Gardner said, We would create thousands of jobs in Colorado, if the Keystone Pipeline were to be built. Gardner based that statement off an old study that measured the overall impact of the Alberta oil sands on the U.S. economy, not the Keystone XL pipeline specifically. The State Department study cited by the company building the pipeline estimates that the equivalent of 30,000 direct, indirect and induced temporary jobs will be created in states outside the pipelines projected route. However, it doesnt specify how many of those would be created in Colorado.",0.3,0.7,0.9,0.4,0.2,0.5,0.6,0.5,0.3,mostly-false

Final Rating: Mostly False  ",Obama voted for tax subsidies and giveways that have slowed oil companies from pursuing clean energy sources.,"At a rally in Harrisburg, Pa., on March 11, 2008, Sen. Hillary Clinton once again took on Sen. Barack Obama for supporting a 2005 energy bill. In 2005, when we had a chance to say no to Dick Cheney and his energy bill, my opponent said yes and voted for it with all of those tax subsidies and giveaways that have been used by the oil companies and others to retard the development of clean, renewable energy, Clinton said. When it counted, I said no, he said yes. Clinton, along with 25 other senators, including 19 Democrats, voted against the bill, which generally reflected the Bush administration's priorities. Obama and 73 Senate colleagues, including a total of 25 Democrats, supported the bill. Obama said the energy bill would help Illinois and promote greater energy independence by doubling ethanol use, spurring investment in hybrid and flexible-fuel vehicles and promoting clean-coal technology. But he said bolder action would have to be taken to rein in high energy costs. This bill, while far from a solution, is a first step toward decreasing America's dependence on foreign oil, Obama said at the time. Clinton has made much of her opposition to the bill in her campaign — for example, characterizing the legislation during a Jan. 15, 2008, Democratic debate in Las Vegas as a big step backward on the path to clean, renewable energy.Our examination of that claim found it to be false. This time, while Clinton rightly points out that the legislation included tax breaks for oil companies — $2.6-billion to be exact — those were largely wiped out by a $3-billion extension of taxes on crude oil to help offset costs associated with oil spills. The bulk of the $14.6-billion in tax incentives included in the legislation actually went to renewable sources of energy, to accelerate the development of wind, clean-coal and nuclear power, and hybrid vehicles. (Although there is debate over whether coal and nuclear power should be considered renewable.) The bill also included a mandate to produce more alternative fuel, requiring 7.5-billion gallons of ethanol — instead of petroleum-derived methyl tertiary butyl ether, or MTBE — to be blended into gasoline by 2012. The industry is on pace to meet that target ahead of schedule, despite Clinton's claims that oil industry tax breaks have been used to retard development of renewable energy. Responding to a PolitiFact inquiry, the Clinton campaign referred to a speech she made on the Senate floor, citing her opposition to the bill because, in part, it ignored pressing energy challenges, including U.S. dependence on foreign oil. The bill includes billions in subsidies for mature energy industries, including oil and nuclear, Clinton said in her July 29, 2005, remarks. However, this reasoning ignores the fact that tax breaks for oil and gas producers encourage domestic production, which helps reduce reliance on foreign oil. Clinton is right that Obama voted for the bill and she didn't. But because she incorrectly depicts the 2005 energy bill as a setback to renewable energy and a sop to Big Oil, we find her statement to be Barely True.

The visual shows Minnesota May 2020! in red type. The caption emphasizes that point, saying same state, same month. The photographs are real depictions of recent protests, but they werent both taken in May 2020 in Minnesota. The images were flagged as part of Facebooks efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The top image shows a group of mostly armed, white men protesting Gov. Gretchen Whitmers stay-at-home order. It happened on April 15 in front of the Michigan State Capitol building in Lansing. Police did not fire tear gas. The image was taken by AFP photographer Jeff Kowalsky. At the time, protesters in several states were pushing for government officials to reopen the economy, saying the restrictions on business infringed upon their rights. There are photos that show a few armed anti-lockdown protestors outside of the Minnesota governor's mansion at the end of April. The second photo is from May 26, a day after video surfaced of a white Minneapolis police officer pinning down a black man by the throat with his knee. The man, George Floyd, pleaded repeatedly that he couldnt breathe and later died at the hospital. The officer, Derek Chauvin, was fired along with three others from the department. Chauvin was arrested on May 29 on charges of third-degree murder and manslaughter. The image of police spraying tear gas at protesters was included in multiple CBS broadcasts the first day of the Minneapolis protests when they were largely non-violent. A Facebook post says an image of armed protesters who werent tear gassed by police and an image of unarmed protesters shielding themselves from tear gas were both taken in May in Minnesota. One is, but one is not. The image of armed protesters is from Michigan in April. The statement contains an element of truth about disparate responses but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.",0.5,0.8,0.9,0.6,0.5,0.7,0.6,0.5,0.4,mostly-false

Final Rating: Mostly False  ","Through competition as governor, I got agreements to build a nearly $40-billion natural gas pipeline.","In her early campaign appearances, Gov. Sarah Palin has repeatedly boasted about her role in advocating a new natural gas pipeline in Alaska. And she has not always stuck to the truth, as we explainin a story here. This is her at a campaign appearance in Fairfax, Va., on Sept. 10, 2008: I'm ready to join John McCain in Washington so we can end the corrupt practices of the abuse of earmarks once and for all. We'll do that. Through competition as governor, I got agreements to build a nearly $40-billion natural gas pipeline. That's going to help all of you. A commitment to build new natural gas pipeline from Alaska's remote but resource-rich North Slope would indeed be quite an accomplishment. Alaskans have been seeking it for some three decades. As Palin campaigned for governor, she sharply criticized her predecessor's plan to have major oil companies build the pipeline. After she was elected governor, she sought competing proposals. In August 2008, the Legislature accepted one from TransCanada Corp., a Calgary-based company. Under a plan Palin spearheaded, TransCanada will get $500-million in state funds to design and seek approvals for the pipeline. But they are not obligated to build it. Financing and approvals are far from certain, and the company can back out even if those contingencies come through. Several experts we spoke to were skeptical that TransCanada's plan would come to fruition. I'll believe it when I see it, said Sarah Ladislaw, a fellow specializing in Western Hemispheric energy issues at the Center for Strategic & International Studies. Palin has repeatedly mischaracterized the agreement with TransCanada. In a news conference in Alaska on Aug. 1, 2008, she said the state never before had commitments to build this line. Now we do. In its news story the next day, theAnchorage Daily Newswrote: That's incorrect. TransCanada has not promised to actually build the gas line, one of the state's grandest and most frustrated economic development dreams. The state license ... is not a construction contract and does not guarantee a pipeline will be built. Rather, it's an exclusive deal under which the state will provide up to $500-million plus other incentives, such as a coordinator to speed up permits, in exchange for TransCanada doing its best to secure the customers, financing, and U.S. and Canadian regulatory clearances. Palin also frequently says the pipeline would cost nearly $40-billion, as she did in this claim. We're not sure where she got that figure — neither her office in Alaska nor the McCain campaign returned our calls to tell us. TransCanada estimates the cost at $26-billion. Yes, there could be cost overruns. But experts were skeptical the price could reach Palin's estimate. Palin's accomplishment sounds impressive in her words — far more than it actually is. The agreement she reached — with the help of the Alaska State Legislature — is not a commitment to build, but rather a commitment to begin planning the massive project. Palin's claim suggests that construction is assured, but that's just not true. And if it were, it wouldn't be a $40-billion pipeline. Those are two significant flaws in this claim Palin makes repeatedly. ",0.2,0.8,0.9,0.3,0.1,0.5,0.6,0.8,0.4,mostly-false

Final Rating: Mostly False  ","Says Judge Gonzalo Curiel is a member of a club or society, very strongly pro-Mexican.","Presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump says U.S. District Court Judge Gonzalo Curiel is not treating me fairly. Curiel ruled that the public can see internal papers from the now defunct Trump University. Trumps critics and reporters have pounced on the documents. Theyve pointed to examples of a calculated effort to target people who could ill-afford expensive training sessionsand had little chance of profiting from them. But for Trump, the bad press stems from a bad legal decision that has more to do with his immigration policies than the merits of a lawsuit. He said it is just common sense that Curiels ties to Mexico explain his ruling. Curiel, born and raised in Indiana, had parents who were naturalized U.S. citizens from Mexico. CBS News host John Dickerson pressed Trump as to what his parents had to do with him not ruling in Trumps favor. He is a member of a club or society, very strongly pro-Mexican, which is all fine, Trump said on Face the Nation on June 5. But I say, he's got bias. I want to build a wall. Its a serious matter to accuse federal judges of bias solely because of their ethnic background, and top-ranking Republicans have rejected Trumps line. Our interest though is strictly in this club that Trump referenced. Is it actually strongly pro-Mexican as he said? We reached out to the Trump campaign for details and did not hear back. The group in question is the California La Raza Lawyers Association. It dates back to 1977. The groups immediate past president, Joel Murillo, told us that it was formed in response to stereotyping coming from judges and lawyers. There were judges on the bench saying people with Spanish surnames were prone to be savages, Murillo said. When we tried to integrate with the mainstream bar association, we were denied. We were marginalized. The only people who were willing to work with us were us. Murillo says the days of stereotyping are over, and the group now focuses on the professional development of Latino lawyers and encouraging students to pursue a career in law. He called Trumps description of the association as very strongly pro-Mexican a misnomer. Murillo said most of the groups recent work targets improving the quality of education for all students in California. The group has not been involved in the immigration debate. The closest was when there were beatings by police and others that offended the constitutional rights of people, Murillo said. We made suggestions of ways toameliorate attacks on people with Spanish surnames. Our search of the Nexis newspaper database found an episode in 2004 when the association wrote a letter calling for the cancellation of a popular Los Angeles reality television show in which illegal immigrants competed for the free services of an immigration lawyer to apply for a green card. The show functions as a magnet to encourage people to enter this country without documentation, the letter said. The groups bylaws state, The purpose and goal of this association is to promote the interests of the Latino communities throughout the state and the professional interests of the membership. That membership is now about half Latino, Murillo said, and in terms of party affiliation, the lawyers who belong pretty much reflect the population. California is about 43 percent Democratic, 28 percent Republican and about 24 percent undeclared. Murillo also noted that strictly speaking, the group is focused on the Latino community, a term that is much broader than people with family roots in Mexico. The associations website, last updated in 2013, describes a judicial committee that seeks to increase the number of Latinos appointed to judgeships. Kevin Johnson, dean of the University of California Davis School of Law, told us the association is seen as a pretty moderate group thats mainly focused on civil rights. On the legal front, we found the group filed a 2012 friend of the court brief in support of Sergio Garcia, an undocumented immigrant from Mexico seeking admission to the State Bar of California. But the issue was broader than simple Hispanic solidarity. That brief was co-written by the Asian/Pacific Bar Association of Sacramento. In 2002, the San Francisco chapter joined with nine other organizations to support an appeal on the grounds that racism tainted the jury selection process. The defendant, Stanley Williams, did not have a Spanish surname, and the other organizations included the NAACP, the Southern Christian Leadership Conference of Los Angeles, the Asian Law Caucus and the American Civil Liberties Union of Northern California. We asked Johnson if including La Raza in the groups name carried a special meaning. He said the term is sort of a product of its times that emerged from the Chicano civil rights movement of the 1960s. The founders and presidents have not been remarkable, in a political sense, Johnson said. The group is often confused with the National Council of La Raza, an advocacy group often criticized by conservatives. Aside from a similarity in their names, the only tie we found was a link to the National Council of La Raza on the lawyers association website. But that list of links also includes the National Latino Police Officers Association and the Hispanic Chamber of Commerce. The conservative website Redstate posted an op-ed rebuking Trumps use of the California lawyers group as proof of Judge Curiels political motives. The writer, Leon Wolf, called the effort to disparage the association dishonest. As far as I can tell, they appear to be a pretty garden variety special interest lawyers association, Wolf wrote. Every state has these chapters for Hispanic lawyers, black lawyers, women lawyers, Mormon lawyers, Christian lawyers, Jewish lawyers -- you name it, there is a lawyer association for it in every state. Our ruling Trump said Curiel belonged to a group that is very strongly pro-Mexican. The California La Raza Lawyers Association does advance the interests of the Latino legal community and works on issues that matter in Latino communities more broadly. However, it has stayed on the sidelines in the immigration debate. The one exception is one letter from a dozen years ago which objected to a television show on the grounds that the program encouraged people to enter the country without documentation. The groups rare court filings focus on civil rights in general. Trumps statement is accurate only in the sense that the associations mission aims to support Latinos, but even that is flawed becausehe said the group was pro-Mexican and the Latino designation reaches a wider set of people. The claim ignores critical facts that would give a very different impression. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/65caa1ee-d498-4628-bfb0-06dfb82e4b14",0.5,0.7,0.9,0.7,0.4,0.6,0.5,1.0,0.5,mostly-false

Final Rating: False  ",Says a progressive income tax proposal from Democratic governor candidate J.B. Pritzker is wholly regressive.,"Illinois flat income tax, currently set at a rate of 4.95 percent for all individual taxpayers, is an outlier. The federal government, as well as most states that have an income tax, feature what is commonly referred to as a progressive tax system in which higher earners pay higher rates. Democrat J.B. Pritzker, the challenger to Republican Gov. Bruce Rauner in the November election, says he wants to switch Illinois to a progressive tax, though he has been vague about details. Rauners running mate, Lt. Gov. Evelyn Sanguinetti, recently ripped into Pritzkers tax plan during an interview on a Fox News-affiliated talk radio station that serves the Illinois suburbs of St. Louis. Pritzker will stick you with that progressive income tax which is surely to be an increase—not to mention the fact that it is wholly regressive, Sanguinetti told Marc Cox of KFTK. That is quite the oxymoron. Can a progressive income tax actually be regressive? We decided to check. The Illinois Constitution mandates a flat-rate income tax, and any move to try to change that would have to overcome difficult procedural hurdles in the state legislature as well as sharp ideological and political disputes. Republicans, Rauner among them, contend that taxing income at graduated levels would inevitably lead to an unfair and unnecessary tax increase in sheeps clothing. Democrats, meanwhile, insist the change is critical to easing the burden on lower-income taxpayers and raising revenue to fund key services like public education. Pritzker backs a constitutional amendment to allow for a progressive tax. As a stopgap until that could be accomplished, however, the Democrat says he wants to raise the current flat tax rate—he hasnt specified how much—but would make it artificially progressive by offsetting the increased cost for the non-affluent with enhanced tax credits. Thats where Sanguinettis up-is-down critique comes in. We asked a spokesman for the Rauner/Sanguinetti campaign to explain what she meant. He took a pass on explaining her thesis that progressive means regressive, but it seems unlikely it was a slip-of-the-tongue because the campaign promoted audio and a transcript of the interview on its website. No less an authority than the Internal Revenue Service says a regressive tax pretty much means what it sounds like, too. The IRS defines it as a tax that takes a larger percentage of income from low-income groups than from high-income groups. The spokesman, Justin Giorgio, did however weigh in on Sanguinettis contention that taxes would rise. Lt. Governor Sanguinetti was simply saying that if J.B. Pritzker has his way, more Illinoisans will be paying higher taxes, Giorgio said in an email, referencing Pritzkers constitutional workaround plan. That fact check noted that a Pritzker spokesman had specifically ruled out anything that would raise taxes on middle-class families. It also highlighted how several states with graduated taxes had set rates for middle- and low-income earners below the flat tax rate Illinois now charges. As for Sanguinettis progressive-is-regressive scenario, economist J. Fred Giertz with the Institute of Government and Public Affairs at the University of Illinois told us a plan like Pritzkers wouldnt qualify as regressive. If lower income people pay a lower rate than higher income people, that by definition is a progressive rate, Giertz said. The only way a regressive rate exists is if low-income people pay  a higher rate of tax. For the record, Giertz says Illinois current flat-tax system isnt regressive either and could even be considered slightly progressive because it already includes some tax credits for low-income earners that enable them to pay a lower effective tax rate than those of higher income. Sanguinetti said in a recent radio interview that Pritzkers plan for a progressive income tax is wholly regressive. A spokesman declined to explain what she meant by that. But the federal definition for a regressive tax makes her statement read like something straight out of Opposite Day. According to both the IRS and an Illinois economics expert, a regressive tax is one that takes a greater share of income from those who earn less than from those who earn more. A progressive tax, on the other hand, is one that requires higher earners to pay a higher rate than their lower earning counterparts.",0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,false

Obama's finance team is recommending a . . . 1% tax on all transactions at any financial institution.,"Is President Obama's finance team scheming with Congress to place a 1-percent tax on every banking transaction you make?That's the assertion of an e-mail that's been showing up in local inboxes.It says: President Obama's finance team is recommending a transaction tax. His plan is to sneak it in after the November election to keep it under the radar. This is a 1% tax on all transactions at any financial institution.The e-mail is anonymous -- isn't it always? -- but it says, in effect, that if you deposit $1,000, $10 will go to the government. If you withdraw $1,000, $10 from the balance remaining in your account will be sent to Washington. The e-mail claims that the bill, HR-4646, was introduced by Rep. Peter DeFazio, D-Ore., and Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa.Because DeFazio is from Oregon, Oregon PolitiFact checked into the claim and reported its findings last month. Here's what they said, reprinted with a few editing changes:The bill, HR-4646, is indeed actual legislation whose subject has something to do with taxation. But that's where the similarities end.The Debt Free America Act was introduced by Rep. Chaka Fattah, D-Pa., in February 2010. He proposed a 1-percent tax on all money transactions, including cash transactions, checks, credit cards, those processed through the Federal Reserve Bank, and those collected at the point of sale. Fattah's idea was to use the money to pay down the national debt and eventually replace the income tax. He has proposed similar legislation since 2004.HR-4646 had no support -- and certainly not from Obama's finance team -- and is now dying a quiet death in committee. Yet the resolution continues to live online, where the DeFazio connection has been repeated by a former Hernando County (Fla.) commissioner.Penny Dodge, DeFazio's chief of staff, told PolitiFact Oregon that the congressman opposes HR-4646.

One post claimed, falsely, that the shortage is manufactured and then went on to say that people could use raw goats milk or make her friends homemade recipe. Another offered a recipe with cows milk, whey and a variety of oils, saying homemade formula can be a viable option when you do it correctly. And another offered up a tattered 1960s recipe card that called for giving the baby two level tablespoons of Karo corn syrup. Feeding babies homemade formula — no matter how legitimate or questionable the recipe may appear — is dangerous and not recommended as an alternative to store-bought formula. The post was flagged as part of Facebooks efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The U.S. Food and Drug Administration advises against making formula and says consuming homemade formula can result in adverse health effects for infants. The American Academy of Pediatrics also strongly advises against homemade formulas, saying they are not safe and do not meet babies nutritional needs. The shortage of infant formula has been attributed to COVID-19 related supply chain issues, inflation, and a February 2022 product recall by Abbott, a major U.S. manufacturer of baby food, that temporarily halted production at its Sturgis, Michigan plant. The White House recently announced steps intended to ease the shortage, including making it easier to import formula and cracking down on price gouging. The FDA is also expediting and streamlining some of its processes in an effort to address the shortage. Following cases in 2021 of hospitalized infants suffering from low calcium after being fed homemade formula, the FDA reported that potential problems with homemade versions include contamination and inadequate amounts of critical nutrients. These problems are very serious, and the consequences range from severe nutritional imbalances to foodborne illnesses, both of which can be life-threatening, the agency said. Homemade formulas may not provide enough of some nutrients, or they can contain too-large quantities of others, which is equally dangerous. For example, homemade formula might have too much salt, which infants kidneys and livers cannot handle in large amounts, wrote Dr. Steven Abrams, chair of the National Committee on Nutrition for the American Academy of Pediatrics, in a May 9 blog post. If your baby doesn't get enough of the important parts of infant formula — even for a few days or weeks — they can suffer long term effects on their abilities to grow strong and do well in school, Abrams said. Lack of these nutrients can lead to severe health problems and even death. Homemade formulas may also lead to risks of contamination, causing infections or may even cause serious problems with high or low levels of minerals like calcium or electrolytes such as sodium. Commercial infant formulas, on the other hand, are designed to mimic human breast milk as closely as possible, and are carefully regulated to make sure they have the nutrients growing babies need — in a form their bodies can process, the New York Times reported. Social media users are sharing homemade infant formula recipes amid the shortage and are claiming that homemade formula is safe. Pediatricians and organizations like the American Academy of Pediatrics and FDA all advise against making and feeding homemade baby formula to infants. These recipes can rob babies of essential nutrients needed for development and may also lead to risks of contamination and infection. Such recipes arent considered safe and should not replace store-bought formula.",0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,false

The Vaccine Adverse Event Recording System shows that 5,946 people have died because of the vaccine, the user states, referring to a government database called the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System, or VAERS. The TikTok post was shared on Facebook and flagged as part of Facebooks efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Thats not what VAERS shows. In fact, there have been no established or proven cases of a COVID-19 vaccine causing death in the U.S. VAERS is run by two federal agencies, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Food and Drug Administration. It is designed so that any person can report an adverse event that occurs after a vaccination, and anyone can scour the reports. The system helps researchers collect data on vaccine after-effects and to detect patterns that may warrant a closer look. But VAERS accepts reports without verifying whether a vaccine actually caused that incident. That makes VAERS a breeding ground for misinformation that spreads quickly on social media and elsewhere. For more than 30 years, VAERS data has been misused to justify broad conclusions that vaccines are harmful. As for COVID-19, more than 346 million doses of vaccines were administered in the U.S. from Dec. 14, 2020, through Aug. 2, 2021, according to the CDC. During that period, VAERS received 6,490 reports of death (0.0019%) among people who received a COVID-19 vaccine. But VAERS reports alone do not indicate whether a vaccine causes a particular adverse effect. They indicate only that a particular event occurred after a vaccination. Researchers can use that data as a starting point to study whether the event is linked to the vaccine. A review of available clinical information, including death certificates, autopsy and medical records, has not established a causal link to COVID-19 vaccines, the CDC says.

Beck said.Said Guilfoyle: Could it be any more broad and frightening? Here you are trying to be a good citizen and make a charitable contribution, do something that's good — and guess what? They are jumping right inside you, seizing all of your personal and private (information) ... And it's absolutely legal, Glenn. They can do it.They can continue to track you basically forever, Guilfoyle warned. Once they tap into your system, the government, of course, has like malware systems and tracking cookies and they can tap in anytime they want.Can you believe that? she asked. I mean, seriously, they can get all your information.Later, Goldberg said it was all very troubling. And, look, let me give you a hard example of this. Say you use Skype or some other Internet phone system, right? If you're on the phone while logged in on this thing, according to this, according to a lawyer I talked to before ... the government can legally listen to your phone call. They can check out what Web sites you've been searching.Because it says ... your computer is a government's property, Goldberg said.That's correct, if you log on to this at your home, everything in your home is now theirs? Beck asked.Basically, Guilfoyle said, and there's nothing you can do. To dissect this one, we have to begin by noting the small amount of truth in their comments. The statement Beck read was on a government Web site for auto dealers, but Guilfoyle twists that into some incorrect claims about the government getting access to individuals. Here's the true part: The Department of Transportation confirmed the language was on the cars.gov Web site, but on Aug. 3 it was removed. The DOT released this statement to PolitiFact: A security warning on the CARS.gov dealer support page that stated computers logged into the system were considered property of the Federal Government has been removed. We are working to revise the language. The language was posted on the portion of the website accessible by car dealers and not the general public. It would be factually inaccurate to say that any computer that went to cars.gov would become the property of the U.S. government, said Sasha Johnson, a DOT spokeswoman said. Although Beck began his segment by noting that the warning was on a part of the site for dealers, Guilfoyle then distorted the truth by suggesting it applied to members of the general public coming to the site for information about Cash for Clunkers. The allegations escalated as she and Goldberg issued warnings about anyone even typing in that address at home. And that's just wrong. Beck seemed to concede that point when raising the issue again on Aug. 3. Now, these blogs have come out this weekend and said, 'Oh, there goes Glenn Beck trying to stir up trouble again. It doesn't affect the average person. It's just the car dealerships.' I'm sorry. I'm sorry. It's just the car dealerships. Oh, so then I shouldn't care? It's not the average people? It's just the average people who are in small business running the car dealerships, Beck said. DOT's Johnson said the government has no plans to take over the computer of auto dealers either. And, again, the language was removed on Aug. 3. But the language was there when Beck and Guilfoyle first raised their concerns. And clearly the language was overly broad, and bad enough to give ammunition to conspiracy theorists. That much is implied by the fact the government felt the need to remove the language. So in that sense, we think the DOT bears some blame for the confusion. Had she said from the start that this just applied to dealers completing transactions, we might be more generous in our ruling. But we think anyone who saw the July 31 program — in which she claimed seriously, they can get all your information — would be left with the clear impression that anyone who logged into the cars.gov site was opening their computer to Big Brother. And that's False.",0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,false

Final Rating: False  ","Says that President Joe Biden said Americans will start seeing direct deposits in their bank accounts this weekend, and that Medicare recipients will get back $2,880.","A video shared on Facebook purports to show President Joe Biden announcing that Americans will get a new round of stimulus payments over the next several weeks. Some people in the country will start seeing those direct deposits in their bank accounts this weekend, Biden says in the Feb. 15 video. Payments to eligible Americans will continue throughout the course of the next several weeks. The video features a split screen view of Biden giving a speech at the top and signing an executive order at the bottom. Care First Homes, the Facebook page that shared the clip, claims that it came across (the video) on the news last night. My friend also called me this morning and told me about the great news for Medicare holders in the US, the account goes on to say. All I did was entered my zip on the website and confirmed my Medicare details and now we are getting back $2880. Just check zip on the website! Americans expecting any such payment will be left disappointed, because the video is a fake and didnt appear on any recent newscast. This post was flagged as part of Facebooks efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The voice heard on the video isnt Bidens but of an impersonator mimicking his speaking style. The voice also doesnt match the mouth movements in the video clip of Biden, which repeats in a loop every four seconds. The clips of Biden speaking and signing an executive order were not related to stimulus payments. The speaking clip was taken from footage of a speech he gave Nov. 1, 2021, on climate change at the COP26 summit in Glasgow, Scotland. The clip of Biden signing an executive order is from Feb. 24, 2021, when he signed an order related to a global shortage of electronic chips. The voiceover actually uses comments made by White House press secretary Jen Psaki on March 11, 2021, about the American Rescue Plan Act. PolitiFact previously checked a claim that also repurposed Psaki's comments as proof of a new round of stimulus payments and rated it False. The federal government has sent out three rounds of COVID-19 relief payments to Americans. While some legislators have called for a fourth round of payments, it has yet to be approved. The Facebook post also mentions Medicare recipients will also receive $2,800, but we have not been able to find any evidence to back this claim. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, the federal agency that administers the Medicare program, did not immediately respond to PolitiFacts request for comment. A different social media post claimed Medicare recipients were eligible for a flexible spending card that covered up to $2,880 in expenses — the same amount as mentioned in the Facebook post. PolitiFact ruled that Mostly False. The cards are offered by private insurers, not Medicare. A Facebook video purports to show President Biden announcing a new round of stimulus payments to Americans, and the caption on the post claims Medicare recipients will receive $2,880. The video was doctored, using an imitator to mimic Biden. The video actually repurposed comments made by Jen Psaki regarding the American Rescue Plan Act in March. We found no evidence to back the claim about Medicare recipients receiving $2,880.",0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,false

Final Rating: False  ",Says Deputy Comptroller Aycha Sawa blocked an audit of the Milwaukee lead program for three years that put our children in danger and spurred a criminal investigation.,"In an election season already historically bizarre due to the coronavirus pandemic, of course we have a down-and-dirty race for a position in city finance. The normally low-profile Milwaukee comptroller post, held since 2012 by the retiring Martin Matson, is up for grabs, pursued by Deputy Comptroller Aycha Sawa and state Assembly Democrat Jason Fields. The comptroller is the citys chief financial officer, but a series of ads from a dark-money group backing Fields have made this a race about lead pipes. The specifics of the claim vary by ad, but one mailer sent to various homes in Milwaukee summed up the core of the attacks on Sawa. The flier, funded by the Leaders for a Better Community, says this: For three years, Deputy Comptroller Aycha Sawa and the Milwaukee Comptrollers office blocked an audit of Milwaukees lead abatement programs. This put our children in danger. Her inaction has even led to a criminal investigation. Lets be clear up front — that is a wild exaggeration at every turn. Heres the breakdown. Leaders for a Better Community is a politically active nonprofit that doesnt have to disclose the source of its funds. The supposed issue ad directs readers to call a number at the comptrollers office (a number no longer in use) or visit the groups website for more information on their plan for transparency and accountability (no such plan is posted). The group was founded in 2015 and previously supported Fields in a 2016 run for state Assembly, according to the Wisconsin Democracy Campaign. It is run by Sherwin Hughes, a long-time friend of Fields. Fields referred to Hughes in a March 8, 2020, Facebook post as our guy, our friend, my brother, an advisor. The race pits Fields against Sawa, who has worked in the office she now seeks to run since 2010, working her way up from auditor to lead auditor, audit manager, accounting director and now deputy comptroller. Fields served in the state Assembly from 2005-13, and now again since 2017. He has also worked as a stockbroker and runs several local organizations. A February 2020 Milwaukee Journal Sentinel story noted he is seeking the citys top finance job despite a background that includes a bankruptcy in 2016 and drunken driving convictions from 2008 and 2014. The ad campaign ignores those backgrounds and focuses on the citys lead abatement program. The program, run by the Milwaukee Health Department, is the subject of an outside audit and was condemned in a state report from 2018 that found more than 90% of cases were closed before the amount of lead in a childs' blood had dropped to levels deemed safe by the state, among numerous other failings. So lets get back to the ad. As evidence of its multiple claims, the mailer lists four sources in footnotes: None of these prove the claims in any way. In an email to PolitiFact Wisconsin, Hughes provided no additional direct evidence, stating simply: The city of Milwaukee had been requesting lead abatement audit for years. Per the current comptroller, Sawa was in charge of audit division. That response is just as misleading as the mailer itself. Heres the reality behind the mailers claims. For three yearsblocked an audit of Milwaukee lead abatement Hughes did not respond to a question asking what three-year window this referred to. But another flier references this in the present tense, saying the office has refused for three years, so well work from the assumption it is a 2017 to 2020 window. Matson, the current comptroller, said in a phone interview an audit of the lead program was never on the table before the rampant lead issues around the city began coming to light in 2016 and 2017. The lead program in the city years ago was considered the example for the rest of the country, so it was considered a low-risk item, he said. By the time lead concerns in Milwaukee became more public, Sawa was no longer in charge of the audit division. She held that position from 2012 until February 2015, when she was promoted to accounting director, Matson said. Even the behind-the-scenes memos where city officials discussed issues with the lead program were just starting to circulate in early 2015. That was an outright lie, Matson, who has endorsed Sawa, said of the blocking claim. Then theres this key detail: An audit has in fact taken place, conducted by an outside agency, and it was recently completed. Put our children in danger Its absurd to attribute this to Sawa, who at the time lead concerns were raised was the accounting director. Her job there was assuring the accuracy of the citys financial statements, her biography says. Her inaction has even led to a criminal investigation This is flat-out ridiculous. The criminal investigation connected to the lead testing is of the health department, not the comptrollers office. The investigation came after former health commissioner Bevan Baker was forced from his job in January 2018, and a number of other staffers were disciplined, forced to resign or fired. There was never a criminal probe into Sawa or the comptrollers office. The actual audit involved has yet to be released to the public, though Matson said a copy of the findings have been submitted to the city. In January 2018, the Common Council directed the city clerk to audit all Health Department programs within 90 days, as lead concerns grew. Matson said he objected at the time, arguing this was both not humanly possible and that only a few organizations around the country were qualified to audit a lead abatement program, so the council rescinded the request and asked the comptrollers office to seek an outside audit. The city eventually reached an agreement in February 2019 for an audit by the Public Health Foundation, a nonprofit organization based in Washington, D.C., and it began work in May 2019. A flier attacking Sawa says she blocked an audit of the citys lead abatement program for three years that put our children in danger and spurred a criminal investigation. But Sawas oversight of city audits ended in 2015, well before any concerns with the citys lead testing program publicly came to light. And in any case, there was never any suggested or proposed audit brought forward that she could block. Implying she continued blocking something for a three-year span is pure fiction — as is the claim that her actions spurred a criminal investigation. The investigation was of the health department, not Sawa or the comptrollers office. And, of course, an audit has in fact been done.",0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,false

Final Rating: False  ","Says during George W. Bushs administration we were losing millions of jobs per month, while under Barack Obama we have three years of gaining hundreds of thousands of jobs per month.","On the day of the final release of jobs numbers before the presidential election, liberal filmmaker Michael Moore tweeted a comparison of how the job market has fared under President Barack Obama and his predecessor, President George W. Bush.Under Bush we were LOSING MILLIONS of jobs per month; under Obama we have 3 yrs of gaining hundreds of thousands of jobs per mo, Moore tweeted to his 1.2 million followers.Were Moores figures correct? No -- in fact, Moore conceded so himself when he sent a corrected tweet about five hours later. Let's look at the numbers.Job losses under BushWe turned to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the governments official collector of employment numbers. Since Moore didnt specify what types of jobs he was referring to, we took the most basic measure -- private sector jobs combined with government jobs, not counting farm jobs or the military.During Bushs final year -- the year with the heaviest job losses during his tenure -- the monthly net change in jobs bottomed out in the fourth quarter. Between October 2008 and November 2008, the economy shed 803,000 jobs. Between November 2008 and December 2008, the economy lost 661,000 jobs. And between January 2009 and December 2008, the economy lost 818,000 -- the highest number of Bushs tenure (and higher than any monthly loss under Obama).Thats a huge number, but its not MILLIONS. In fact, its not even 1 million. So Moores tweet exaggerated the size of the losses under Bush.Job gains under ObamaThe job picture did eventually improve under Obama, but Moore exaggerates when he says the economy has been gaining hundreds of thousands of jobs per month for the last three years under Obama.During 2010, the job market expanded by an average of 85,000 per month. In 2011, the average rose to 153,000 per month. And in 2012, the average rose again, to 157,000 per month.Those numbers are a whole lot better than what the nation experienced in 2008, but these rises dont qualify as hundreds of thousands, which we would define as at least 200,000.What about increases above 200,000 during individual months? Looking at the 34 months since January 2010, the net increase has exceeded 200,000 jobs a total of 10 times, or less than one-third of the time. And several of those were months where the job numbers were boosted only temporarily due to a flurry of hiring for the once-a-decade U.S. Census. Moore's correction About five hours after Moore's original tweet was posted, and after we had contacted his office, he sent a tweet correcting the record. Thx for tweets on job loss - worst month w/Bush was 800K+ jobs lost, most months since '10 have had 100K+ jobs gained http://mmflint.me/QbEkPM. Moore's second tweet was correct. Our rulingMoore's initial tweet was incorrect when it said the nation was losing millions of jobs per month under Bush, since even the weakest month under Bush saw the economy lose less than 1 million jobs per month. And he was also incorrect to say that the economy has been gaining hundreds of thousands of jobs per month for three years under Obama. The economy has averaged well under 200,000 jobs per month during that period and only exceeded the job-gain threshold of 200,000 in 10 months. We applaud his correction, but we still rate his initial tweet False.",0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,false

Final Rating: False",A photo shows sex traffickers using an abandoned child car seat to lure in victims.,"Social media users continue to share posts claiming that sex traffickers are using abandoned car seats to lure in victims, even as local police and the organization behind the National Human Trafficking Hotline have said such claims are unfounded. Human trafficking is a legitimate threat that affects millions of people. But the photo of an empty child car seat sitting in a parking lot was not the tell-all that social media users were making it out to be. The photo appears to have originated with an Oct. 9 Facebook post. The poster wrote that the car seat was in the parking lot of a Walmart in Wilkesboro, North Carolina. Sex traffickers use this method to lure you in and snatch you up, the poster claimed.  An Oct. 9Facebook post claimed sex traffickers were using an abandoned car seat to lure victims. The Facebook post was shared more than 700 times, and screenshots of it were flagged as part of the platforms efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) But the viral internet rumor exploded further online after a TikTok user warned about what she described as the latest trap from sex traffickers. The video from Paige Marie Parker, who describes herself as a spiritual gardener and now has more than 178,000 followers, was reported by Rolling Stone after it got 12.2 million views in just over a day. It is no longer available on TikTok, but PolitiFact found a copy of it online. So have you ever seen this type of car seat just out of nowhere? Parker says in the video, as she points to a Facebook post from the Wilkesboro Police Department addressing the car seat photo and rumors. Thats not an ordinary car seat. Thats actually a trap. Thats actually a sex trafficking car seat, Parker continues. No parent will ever leave a random car seat out there just to be out there. They want you to go up to the car seat and look around while theyll really snatch you really quick. Its a ploy. Please be safe out here ladies. Its important for people to stay aware of their surroundings. Should you want to report or seek services related to a case of human trafficking, you can contact the National Human Trafficking Hotline at 1-888-373-7888 or email [emailprotected]. But the Wilkesboro Police Department statement that Parker highlighted in her video did not confirm that traffickers are using car seats to draw in victims; instead, it debunked the rumor. The department wrote that it had investigated the car seat photo from the original Facebook post, and that the backstory had nothing to do with sex trafficking. At no time was this incident deemed to be involved in any criminal activity, the department concluded. The car seat was in the parking lot, the police said, because two Walmart customers purchased a new child car seat, then they removed their old one and left it there. Interim department chief Tommy Rhodes told the Associated Press that the police reviewed security footage of the events to determine what happened. If we for one second thought that was a sex trafficking ploy, we would be all over that, Rhodes said. Polaris, the organization that runs the National Human Trafficking Hotline, said in its own statement that when narratives like the car seat myth go viral, it can do serious harm to actual trafficking survivors, including by overwhelming anti-trafficking organizations limited resources to respond to tips. Recent rumors about sex traffickers using abandoned child car seats to lure victims are unfounded, the Polaris statement said. A similar Facebook post claimed in September that empty baby car seats are being used as a lure to get you out of your car so you can be abducted or followed. The post purported to show photos of a car seat left in a parking lot in Nashville. It was shared nearly 300,000 times. Other unsubstantiated internet rumors warning about human trafficking plots have taken off in the past. One rumor spread on Facebook in 2019 cautioned that sex traffickers were afixing zip ties to car door handles as a means of distracting victims. Another claim from 2019, amplified by the then-mayor of Baltimore, alleged that sex traffickers were driving white vans.  More recently, supporters of the QAnon movement advanced evidence-free conspiracy theories that separately accused Walmart and Wayfair, an online furniture retailer, of using certain items as cover for selling and shipping children to pedophiles. Facebook posts claimed that a photo shows a plot by sex traffickers to use abandoned child car seats to lure in victims. Police investigated the photo of an abandoned car seat that inspired this internet rumor. They concluded that it was not associated with sex trafficking or other criminal activity. Polaris, which runs the National Human Trafficking Hotline, called the rumor unfounded and a myth.",0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,false

Final Rating: False  ",Says Barack Obama counted on Sandy Adams to approve stimulus spending.,"Things get ugly when two sitting lawmakers vie for the same seat.This is certainly the case in the Republican primary battle for Floridas 7th Congressional District.The Central Florida race features Rep. John Mica, a political veteran with a role in House leadership, and Rep. Sandy Adams, who rode the 2010 tea party wave out of the state Legislature and into Congress.In a scathing mailpiece, Mica claims he is the right person to represent the reorganized 7th Congressional District because Adams is in cahoots with President Barack Obama.The piece states in large type, Barack Obama counted on Sandy Adams.Some more excerpts: Sandy Adams Voted Twice to Approve $8 Billion in Obama Stimulus Spending.Compare Sandy Adams to John Mica before you vote in the Republican primary.John Mica is the only Republican in this race to vote against Obama stimulus.Wait, what? Didnt Adams, a tea party favorite endorsed by Sarah Palin, come to Washington in 2011? How could she have supported Obamas 2009 economic stimulus package?The mailer offers citations, in the form of bill numbers and vote dates, to back up its claims. Such a gesture sometimes gives us hope that truthfulness will be found. Alas, no. Micas claim is illogical.The citations are for annual state budgets the Florida Legislature passed in 2009 (SB 2600) and 2010 (HB 5001). Indeed, Adams, then a member of the Florida House, voted for both.Lawmakers faced a tremendous budget shortfall in 2009, and part of the way they offset damaging cuts was to accept $5 billion from the federal stimulus program (and through raising taxes and fees on Floridians by $2.2 billion). The same story emerged in 2010, with $2.4 billion from the stimulus program piped in to patch the deficit.Adams wasnt the only House Republican to vote for these budgets. The plans sailed through the Legislature along party lines, with Republicans almost unanimously in favor. Democrats who voted against the budget in 2009 called it inadequate.Adams, who campaigned against government waste like a lot of her GOP contemporaries, referred to the stimulus as a failed bill in a 2010 Orlando Sentinel op-ed.Micas team says thats not her real position. We needed to let voters know that her record does not match the rhetoric, said Mica spokesman Alan Byrd. Congressman Mica voted no.We have to say, though, we find this line of argument ridiculous.Using Micas logic, that means Obama also counted on Gov. Rick Scott, a high-profile basher of Obamas stimulus and health care reforms. The first budget Scott signed containedmillions of stimulus dollars, after all.Plus, Adams team said Mica is being hypocritical. They pointed to severalinstances in which Mica, along with eight other House Republicans, voted no on the stimulus and then publicly campaigned for Florida to receive stimulus money for projects such as high-speed rail just hours later. His critique of it then was that it didnt spend enough money on transportation projects.Our rulingMica says Obama counted on Adams to approve stimulus spending. That's not the case. Congress approved the stimulus in 2009, before Adams took her seat in 2011. Adams did vote for two state budgets that contained stimulus money, as did many other Florida legislators who opposed the federal law.Likewise, Mica himself lobbied for stimulus projects in Florida once the stimulus became law.Mica's mailer is misleading and hardly offers an apples-to-apples comparison. Adams couldnt have voted on the stimulus program because she wasnt even a member of Congress at the time.We rule this statement Pants on Fire!",0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,false

Final Rating: False  ",Justice Kennedy quit because he and his son helped Trump launder illegal Russian money through Deutsche Bank.,"The New York Timesdetailed connections between the Trump White House and Justice Anthony Kennedy, searching for factors that might have inspired Kennedy to retire so abruptly before the November midterms. The newspaper examined a number of connections that the Trump family might have exploited to earn Kennedys trust: constant praise for his work, the routine promotion of his clerks, and visits from the presidents family. But some conspiracy-minded bloggers have honed in on two paragraphs, nestled in the middle of the article: Kennedys son, Justin Kennedy, had worked with Deutsche Bank when it loaned over $1 billion to Trump, even when other banks had become wary of him. In the New York Times article, this is just one piece of evidence to show that the Kennedy and Trump families were close outside of politics. However, liberal clickbait site Kwotable used the detail to suggest corruption on a much more massive, though unsupported, scale. Its June 30 headline read, Justice Kennedy quit because he and his son helped Trump launder illegal Russian money through Deutsche Bank. The New York Times report didnt go that far, so we decided to dig deeper into the Kwotable claim. Trumps relationship with Deutsche Bank began in the late nineties when many other major lenders were unwilling to do business with him. Between 1991 and 1992, Trump declared bankruptcy four times, making him unpopular among Wall Street bankers, who referred to making deals with him as Donald risk. Deutsche Bank opened up to working with Trump after launching its real estate division in 1998. Mike Offit, a newly-hired managing director, gave Trump a loan to renovate his building on Wall Street, and continued to work with him through the 2008 financial crisis. According to a 2017 report by the New York Times, Trump has done more than $4 billion in business with Deutsche since then, including the construction of Trump Tower in Chicago and the Trump National Doral in Miami. Justin Kennedy began working at Deutsche in 1998 as the managing director and global head of Real Estate Capital Markets, a role he held until leaving in 2009. Kennedy oversaw and approved major real estate loans given through the bank, including multiple loans made to Trump for his real estate enterprise. Trumps connections to Russia are still being investigated by special counsel Robert Mueller. But Deutsche Banks relationship to the country is well-documented, and controversial. In early 2017, banking regulators fined the bank $630 million for its negligence in stopping a Russia-based money laundering scheme, in which Russian clients engaged in illegal mirror-trading. (One client would purchase stocks in rubles through the Moscow branch, and then a conspirator would sell identical stocks for the same price, but through the London branch and in dollars. This money would be transferred to offshore accounts, effectively allowing traders to illegally transfer billions of dollars out of Russia. According to Reuters, this scheme began in 2011.) Between 2010 and 2014, the bank was also involved in the Global Laundromat scandal, which allowed over $20 billion to be funneled from Russia to other countries around the world. The Global Laundromat was a much larger operation than the mirror-trading. It involved top Russian oligarchs and criminals—including Igor Putin, cousin of President Vladimir Putin. The banks name has come up in the Mueller investigation as well, but not in the way the Kwotable article makes you think. In December 2017, Muellers team subpoenaed Deutsche Bank records connected with former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort, who had been indicted in October on suspicion of money laundering, among other crimes. However, there has been no evidence to date that Trump himself was involved with any of the money laundering — or that either Kennedy was involved. Democrats have called for more transparency in Trumps banking history,but the bank has denied their requests, citing confidentiality concerns. The records would be released only in the event of a formal investigation. As for Justin Kennedy, he left Deutsche Bank in 2009, before investigators say the Global Laundromat or mirror-trading scandals began. He has not been formally investigated or accused of involvement in financial foul play. Kennedy and Deutsche Bank declined to comment for this story. Bloggers wrote that Justice Kennedy retired last week because he and his son helped launder illegal Russian money through Deutsche Bank. This story has all the buzz words to make a good conspiracy theory: Russia, real estate, billions of dollars, coincidence, corruption. But there is no evidence that Trump and Justin Kennedy ever had a relationship beyond Trumps real estate loans. There is also no evidence that Kennedy was involved in Russian money laundering, as he left the bank before either of the major scandals happened, or that the Trump White House was blackmailing his father because of it.",0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,false

HORRIFIC! the July 17 post says. Five Jet Blue Airlines pilots are confirmed dead, current Jet Blue whistleblower confirms push for jab continues — how is this SAFE for you and your loved ones? How is this about HEALTH when thousands are dying and they keep PUSHING this poison with coercion? The post shares a video of a talk show in which a guest says that a JetBlue pilot came forward to say that five JetBlue pilots passed away between February of this year and May. She says theres no direct information yet about their jab status but the shows host calls the deaths suspicious. This post was flagged as part of Facebooks efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) JetBlue told PolitiFact that it was aware of a report that mentions four of our pilots and one inflight crew member who have passed away this year, but said there is no connection in their deaths or to the COVID-19 vaccine. The social media video appears designed to intentionally deceive the public and should not be considered a trusted source of information, the company said. In 2020, JetBlues full-time staff included about 3,700 pilots and 4,300 flight attendants, according to its annual report. The names of people who died are given in the video in the post. We reviewed their obituaries and found no mention of COVID-19, a vaccine, or the coronavirus. The obituary of one of the men says he died of kidney cancer. The obituary of a second man says he died after a utility task vehicle accident. The family requested that people attending his memorial service wear masks to protect those who are immunocompromised, have health problems, and/or are vulnerable. The obituary for a third man, a JetBlue crew member, just says that he died unexpectedly, and obituaries for the other two men make no mention of cause of death. Searching more broadly online we found nothing to connect their deaths to the COVID-19 vaccine. We previously fact-checked a similar claim that the death of four British Airways pilots was connected to the COVID-19 vaccine. British Airways said the deaths werent connected to the vaccine. This one merits the same. The suggestion that the deaths of these JetBlue employees was caused by a COVID-19 vaccine is unfounded and in some cases contradicted by the available evidence.",0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,false

Final Rating: False  ",Says Robert Hurt supports the tax loopholes that send American jobs overseas.,"Tom Perriello wants to know what Robert Hurt is hiding with his stance on tax loopholes, but the murkiness comes more from a cookie-cutter Democratic ad campaign than the Republican candidates position.In a political ad, What is Robert Hurt Hiding?, Perriello, a Democratic congressman from Charlottesville, claimed that Hurt, his Republican challenger from Chatham, supports the tax loopholes that send American jobs overseas.The basis of the claim is the Taxpayer Protection Pledge that Hurt signed in December after a much-publicized meeting with Grover Norquist, president of Americans for Tax Reform, a well-known anti-tax group in Washington. Hurt is one of seven challengers in Virginia congressional races -- six Republicans and one independent -- to take the pledge, which the anti-tax group enforces strictly.The pledge for House candidates has two parts: They promise to oppose any increase in marginal income tax rates for citizens or businesses, and they vow to oppose the elimination of tax deductions or credits unless they are offset dollar for dollar by tax cuts or new credits.Simple enough. But it has given Democrats an opening to make a dubious connection to tax credits they portray as loopholes for shipping American jobs offshore.The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee has translated the second part of the pledge to mean that signers support tax loopholes for multinational companies operating in other countries. The DCCC backs up the claim not with the pledge the candidates actually signed, but with three specific bills opposed by Americans for Tax Reform that the group urged pledge signers to oppose. One of them was the $26.1 billion bill adopted in August to help states hire teachers and pay for Medicaid services. The money for those programs would come from closing the loopholes. Hurt opposed that bill, citing the increase in federal spending.Democrats say the money from closing the loopholes was well-spent. Our point is if youre going to spend the money, it should be on creating jobs here, Jesse F. Ferguson, the DCCCs southern region press secretary, told us.But the fact that someone signed the pledge doesnt necessarily mean they are opposed to closing loopholes for off-shore companies.Our friends at FactCheck.org have been knocking down this claim since April, when the DCCC ran a TV ad against a Republican House candidate in Hawaii. They recently debunked the same claim in an ad in the Massachusetts gubernatorial campaign.Heres the problem: The taxpayer pledge doesnt prevent a signer from opposing any tax break as long as he or she finds a way to offset the resulting increase in taxes.The pledge doesnt get into whether something is good or bad tax policy, Ryan Ellis, ATRs director of tax policy, told us. The pledge means that if a bill would result in a net tax increase, youre not free to vote for it, Ellis said.Hurt hasnt offered specifics about his position on the offshore tax rules, but in a TV ad last month, he called Perriellos claim false.We agree. Perriello has chosen to rest his claim on the DCCCs spurious connection to the Taxpayer Protection Pledge, but that is a huge leap of logic and it doesnt prove Hurt supports the offshore loopholes. So we find the claim False.",0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,false

Final Rating: False ","Beginning on Jan. 1, prostitution by minors will be legal in California.","Did California really legalize child prostitution? Thats the startling question our audience asked after reading a misleading op-ed by Republican state Assemblyman Travis Allen in the Washington Examiner. Allens opinion piece has been shared widely on social media and led several readers to ask PolitiFact California to check it out. We decided to fact-check the first line of Allens column, which largely reflects the rest of the piece: Beginning on Jan. 1, prostitution by minors will be legal in California. Yes, you read that right. The op-ed is headlined: California Democrats legalize child prostitution. UPDATE: Allen repeated his claim on The O'Reilly Factor on Fox News on Jan. 4, 2017, saying at the end of his interview that The California Democrats did just legalize child prostitution in California.  Our research Last year, Gov. Jerry Brown signed into law Senate Bill 1322. It decriminalizes prostitution for minors by preventing law enforcement from arresting people under 18 for soliciting sex or loitering with intent to commit prostitution. Supporters of the law said its designed to treat children involved in prostitution as victims rather than as criminals. It does nothing, however, to legalize commercial sex acts. People caught having sex with minors, soliciting sex with minors or arranging clients for them can still be charged with crimes. The key is that the children involved are not liable, not that the conduct has been legalized, said Gabriel Chin, a criminal law professor at UC Davis School of Law, who analyzed the law upon our request. Chin added that under the new law child prostitution is treated just as, say, the production of child pornography is. Adults involved are subject to criminal prosecution, while the children, who are seen as victims, are not, he said. Representatives for Allen did not respond to our questions. Allen, who represents Orange County, told KQED public radio he rejects the criticism hes received over the column. I don't care about any amount of legalistic spin that someone wants to put on it. When you decriminalize something, you legalize it, Allen said in the radio interview. After his initial claim in the op-ed that prostitution by minors will be legal, Allen adds some factual context in his second line by noting law enforcement cant arrest underage workers for soliciting sex. A few paragraphs later, however, he wrongly asserts that the new law means law enforcement cant interfere with minors engaging in prostitution. The law, in fact, includes provisions that officers who encounter these minors shall report the circumstances to the county child welfare agency as abuse or neglect. It also authorizes officers to take a minor engaged in a commercial sex act into temporary custody under some circumstances, including in the event of immediate physical danger or when medical care is needed. Bills author responds Democratic state Sen. Holly Mitchell of Los Angeles, who authored Senate Bill 1322, responded on Twitter to the mischaracterizations of the law. I denounce false claims made by Republicans on my bill #SB1322 that decriminalizes sexually exploited minors, she wrote. I proudly authored SB 1322 to protect minor victims of human sex trafficking from being further charged as criminals for commercial sexual exploitation. This notion, perpetuated by Assemblymember Travis Allen (R-Huntington Beach), that my bill legalizes prostitution and commercial sex for minors is categorically untrue, she added. It remains unlawful for a person under the age of 18 to consent to sexual intercourse in the State of California and the law remains in effect and is not changed with the implementation of my bill.  California state Sen. Holly Mitchell responded to Allen's claims on Twitter. The Sacramento Bees fact-checking team PoliGRAPH also examined Allens op-ed. It described it as a misleading column and rated its assertions False. Our ruling California state Assemblyman Travis Allen claimed in a recent column that Beginning on Jan. 1, prostitution by minors will be legal in California. His claim profoundly distorts a new state law that treats minors engaged in commercial sex acts as victims, but does nothing to legalize prostitution. Young people under age 18 who solicit sex wont be arrested and sent to juvenile hall. Instead, officers will have the option of taking them into temporary custody if they are in immediate danger or need medical attention. It also says officers shall report the circumstances of minors engaged in prostitution to the county child welfare agency as abuse or neglect. The law does nothing to change the fact that it is illegal to have sex with minors, solicit prostitutes or arrange clients. Allens specific claim, and the column in general, is grossly misleading.

Final Rating: False  ",Says NASCAR bans the confederate flag but FORCES all their drivers to do Muslim prayer.,"NASCAR recently announced that it would ban the Confederate flag from being displayed at its events and properties to provide a welcoming and inclusive environment for fans. The move comes amid protests against police brutality and a national outcry to remove Confederate statues and symbols around the country. Now, a Facebook post is sharing an outrageous claim that the racing association forces its drivers to participate in Muslim prayer. It features a photo of a row of drivers kneeling down, bent over with their heads touching the floor. The caption reads: So NASCAR bans the confederate flag but FORCES all their drivers to do Muslim prayer? I wouldnt have believed it if I didnt see it with my own eyes. Unacceptable!! The post was flagged as part of Facebooks efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) This is bogus. NASCAR does not force its drivers to participate in Muslim prayer, or any other religious activity, and the photo displayed shows drivers taking part in a tradition called the kissing the bricks. The tradition takes place at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway's yard-length section of bricks called the Yard of Bricks and was started in 1996 by Dale Jarrett. After his Brickyard 400 victory, Jarrett and his crew walked out to the start-finish line and kissed the bricks. Since then, winners of various races at the speedway have done the same. A reverse-image search shows that the photo in the post was taken on July 24, 2016, when Kyle Busch won the Combat Wounded Coalition 400 at the speedway. Busch, his wife, and others took part in the tradition. A Facebook post that displays a photo of NASCAR drivers kneeling down kissing the floor claims that the racing association forces its athletes to participate in Muslim prayer, yet banned the confederate flag. This isnt true. NASCAR doesnt force or require drivers to partake in any religious activities.

Final Rating: False",Seniors around the world who died from COVID vaccine are being improperly listed as natural causes.,"Suggesting that coronavirus vaccinations killed 86-year-old Hank Aaron and elderly people in Gibraltar and Norway, an article widely shared on Facebook claims that seniors around the world died soon after getting vaccinated, and that their cause of death was listed as natural. Seniors dying after COVID vaccine labeled as natural causes, reads the headline of the article by Dr. Joseph Mercola, a major funder of anti-vaccine efforts. Mercolas work has come under criticism before from federal agencies and others within the medical community. The full article, which requires a registration to view, begins: Around the world, reports are pouring in of people dying shortly after receiving the COVID-19 vaccine.  Ironically, when seniors die before vaccination, its due to COVID-19 and something must be done to prevent it, but when they die after vaccination, they die of natural causes and no preventive action is necessary. The article was flagged as part of Facebooks efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The article relies on evidentiary assertions that have been widely discredited before. Lets look. The article says the death Jan. 22 of Aaron, the Hall of Fame baseball player, is notable because he died 17 days after he chose to be vaccinated publicly in hope that other Black people would get the shot. But the Fulton County (Ga.) Medical Examiners office said Aarons cause of death was natural and not linked to the vaccine. Health Feedback rated as misleading a separate assertion that Aarons death is part of a wave of suspicious deaths among elderly closely following administration of COVID vaccines. The nonprofit fact-checker said there is no evidence to back the claim. Mercolas article said a surge in deaths in Gibraltar after COVID-19 vaccinations began raises questions. The article said Gibraltar, the British overseas territory on the southern coast of Spain, had only 10 COVID-related deaths by Jan. 6. But vaccinations began Jan. 9 and by Jan. 17, the article claimed, the total death toll had suddenly skyrocketed to 45, with most of the people who died during that period being in their 80s or 90s. A Reuters fact-check said a claim that coronavirus deaths in Gibraltar have been caused by the vaccine and not the virus is false, saying there is no evidence linking the deaths to the vaccine. Full Fact reached the same conclusion. The government said in a statement Jan. 27 that 11,073 people had received a first dose of the Pfizer vaccine and none had died as a result of receiving it. Six people between the ages of 70 and 100 who died after receiving the vaccine apparently contracted COVID-19 before being vaccinated, but testing did not detect it, according to the statement. In a Feb. 1 announcement, the government encouraged people over age 60 to be vaccinated, noting that we have offered the vaccine to almost everyone over the age of 60. The article claimed the Norwegian Medicines Agency initially downplayed any connection between the deaths of 29 seniors citizens in the wake of Norways vaccination push — but that the agency is now reconsidering. Those who died were very frail nursing home residents with serious underlying illnesses. The inoculation was not determined to be the cause of death. Since then, in its latest weekly report on adverse reactions to the vaccinations, the agency said Feb. 2 that among the 112,000 people who have received the first dose and 22,000 who have received the second, there were 56 deaths with a temporal link to vaccination. All occurred among nursing home residents over age 70 within 12 days of vaccination. Many of these reports state that no link to vaccination is suspected. The fact that some nursing home residents die soon after being vaccinated does not mean that there is a causal relationship, the report said. Every day, an average of 45 people die in Norwegian nursing homes or other similar institutions. It is therefore to be expected that deaths will occur soon after vaccination, without there necessarily being any causal link to the vaccine. The agency also said in the report: The benefits of administering the vaccine are considered to outweigh any possible risks. A COVID-19 subcommittee of the Global Advisory Committee on Vaccine Safety, an advisory body to the World Health Organization, reviewed information on deaths reported in frail, elderly individuals in Europe who had received the Pfizer vaccine. In a statement Jan. 22, the subcommittee said, The current reports do not suggest any unexpected or untoward increase in fatalities in frail, elderly individuals or any unusual characteristics of adverse events. An article widely shared on Facebook claimed that seniors died soon after getting a COVID-19 vaccination and their cause of death was improperly listed as natural. The article cited the deaths of 86-year-old Hank Aaron and several dozen elderly people in Gibraltar and Norway, all of whom died within a couple of weeks of receiving a COVID-19 vaccination. There is no evidence that the vaccines caused any of the deaths. Aarons death was ruled natural, and authorities in Gibraltar and Norway said none of the deaths of elderly people they investigated were caused by the vaccines.",0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,false

Final Rating: False  ","As soon as I endorsed (Supreme Court Justice Daniel Kelly), the Wisconsin Democrats said, lets move the election to two months later.","The mid-pandemic election in Wisconsin yielded no shortage of bizarre storylines. But a noteworthy one emerged late in the day when President Donald Trump tried to put himself at the center of a debate over whether the election should have even been held as scheduled. The April 7, 2020, contest featured a Democratic presidential primary and a Wisconsin Supreme Court race between conservative-backed Daniel Kelly and liberal-backed Jill Karofsky, as well as numerous local elections. At his daily briefing that day, Trump connected his endorsement of Kelly to Gov. Tony Evers last-minute attempt to change the election. The implication was Democrats thought theyd have a better chance of boosting Karofsky by extending the election period. Heres an excerpt of Trumps extended discussion on the topic: (Wisconsin Democrats) didn't want to move the election. As soon as I endorsed him, the Wisconsin Democrats say, Oh, let's move the election to two months later, three. They didn't mind having the election until I endorsed him, which is very interesting. So Trump is saying his endorsement caused Evers to try moving the election back two months. Lets take a closer look at that timeline. In case you lost track of the election back-and-forth, the basics are these: Evers had said for weeks he didnt have the authority to move the election on his own. Then on Friday — four days before the election — he called on the Republican Legislature to switch to an all-mail election that would allow votes to come in through May 19, 2020. He also ordered a special session of the Legislature for the following day to take up the matter. The state Assembly and Senate both gaveled out of that session in seconds, without taking action. Then, 18 hours before polls opened, Evers issued an order to delay the election to June 9, 2020. Republicans appealed to the Wisconsin Supreme Court, where the conservative majority overturned Evers order, clearing the way to hold the election. Trump is claiming his endorsement of Kelly was a pivotal moment in this back-and-forth. Trump sent a tweet at 12:12 p.m. April 3, 2020, saying Kelly has his complete endorsement. Evers call for a mail-in election was released about an hour later. But thats a coincidence. Heres why Trump is wrong. Evers call at that point was not to move the election by two months, but to switch the format to mail-in only and extend the deadline to May. The attempt to move the in-person election to June didnt come until several days later. And the Evers administration had been moving toward that mail-in announcement well before Trumps tweet, including calls to Republican leaders, said Evers spokeswoman Melissa Baldauff. But theres a much more glaring oversight from Trump. He had already endorsed Kelly several months earlier. At a rally in Milwaukee on Jan. 14, 2020, Trump urged his supporters to go vote for Justice Daniel Kelly to defend the rule of law. At that time, of course, coronavirus was barely a blip on the national radar. And it was the pandemic that fueled the back-and-forth over Wisconsins election, not a repeat of a prior endorsement. In a statement later on Election Day, Evers said Trump was not a factor in his decision-making. I dont pay any attention to who the president endorses, the governor said. Frankly, my focus right now is on keeping the people of this state safe, and thats why I issued an executive order to extend Wisconsins election date and make sure everyone could vote safely from home. Trump claims his endorsement of Kelly caused the Wisconsin attempts to push the election back until June. Thats not at all how it happened. Trump had already endorsed Kelly back in January. And in any case, the action from Evers that coincidentally followed Trumps reiterated endorsement on Twitter was to shift to a mail-in election, not to move the whole election by several months. That leaves us with a claim that is both false and ridiculous.",0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,false

Final Rating: False  ",Says Tammy Baldwin is more worried about the mastermind of 9/11 than supporting CIA director nominee Gina Haspel.,"Does U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin have so much more concern for a 9/11 terrorist, compared to the presidents nominee to run the CIA, that she would vote against the nominee? Its an attack that appears to question the Wisconsin Democrats patriotism. And if its correct, where is the evidence? The claim was made by Leah Vukmir, who is vying with fellow Republican Kevin Nicholson for the chance to run against Baldwin in November 2018. As stated, Vukmirs claim draws a conclusion based on what is publicly known about Baldwins stance toward Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, the mastermind of the Sept 11, 2001 terrorist attacks.  Lets examine if the evidence matches the rhetoric. Like us on Facebook. Follow us on Twitter: @PolitiFactWisc Team Terrorists Vukmir took flak, even from conservatives, when she branded Baldwin and Mohammed as Team Terrorists. But Vukmir then doubled-down and even tripled-down in a series of statements, including one that makes the claim we want to check. In a May 14, 2018 interview, Steve Scaffidi, a conservative talk show host on WTMJ-AM in Milwaukee, asked Vukmir to explain what you were trying to say in tying Baldwin to Mohammed. Vukmir alluded to Gina Haspel, the nominee of President Donald Trump to be director of the Central Intelligence Agency, and said: Tammy and her party are more interested, and theyre more worried about, the mastermind of 9/11 -- the individual that plotted and ultimately killed over 3,000 Americans on our soil. And shes more worried about those individuals than to support a very strong woman with a track record to be the head of the CIA. No evidence When Vukmir did the interview, it was expected that Baldwin would ultimately oppose Haspel. But Baldwin had not yet said whether she would vote for or against the nominee, who needs Senate confirmation to become CIA director. (Three days after the interview, Baldwin announced she'll vote against the nomination.) In any case, Baldwins support or opposition to Haspel is not what were fact checking here. When we asked Vukmirs campaign staff for evidence to support Vukmirs claim that Baldwin is more worried about Mohammed than supporting Haspel, it was lacking. Latest fact checks on the Senate candidates: Baldwin: 97 percent of gun owners support universal background checks. Mostly True. Nicholson: Baldwin cosponsored legislation that wanted to establish the Department of Peace and Nonviolence. Mostly True. Vukmir: Baldwin claims to support a 'Buy America' philosophy, but her actions speak louder than her empty words. False. We were referred only to a New York Times news article, published six days before Vukmirs interview. Vukmirs campaign said the article shows Mohammeds opposition to the nomination of Haspel, a career CIA officer. The article reported on Mohammeds request to share six paragraphs of unspecified information about Haspel with the Senate Intelligence Committee, before the committee voted to recommend Haspels confirmation. Mohammed had been captured in 2003 and tortured by the CIA. But it is not known whether Haspel was involved, directly or indirectly, in his torture, according to the article. Haspel has since declared that the agency should not have undertaken its interrogation program in which al Qaeda detainees were tortured after the Sept. 11 attacks, and is likely to be confirmed by the Senate, according to another Times news article. The article did not even mention Baldwin -- much less provide any evidence that Baldwin had any concern for Mohammed. About Baldwin For her part, when asked the day after Vukmirs interview about Haspel and Vukmirs Terrorist Team attack, Baldwin said on MSNBC she was on a third iteration of attempts to meet with Haspel. Two other points are worth noting: Baldwin did not call for Mohammeds testimony to be allowed by the Senate Intelligence Committee. (She is not a member of the panel.) In the days after 9/11, Baldwin, as a member of the House, voted for a measure overwhelmingly approved by Congress that gave the president authority to use force to invade Afghanistan in response to the 9/11 attacks. In short, Vukmir provided nothing of substance to support linking Baldwin with a terrorist. Our rating Vukmir says Baldwin is more worried about the mastermind of 9/11 than supporting Trumps nominee for CIA director. She provided no information to back up an extreme claim that Baldwin has serious concern for a terrorist that it is motivating her not to support the nominee.",0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,false

Kudos to Republican Governor Rick Scott for having the correctness and guts to move forward on this critical issue !Hooray for Florida ! !I-95 will be jammed for the next month or so........Druggies and deadbeats heading North out of Florida ..Florida is the first state requiring drug testing to receive welfare!Our eyes lit upon the message's first factual claim: Florida is the first state requiring drug testing to receive welfare! Is this true?We asked some experts, but not before doing a quick Web search to see if we might find some of the message's genesis. At least three sentences of the chain e-mail, it turns out, appear to be lifted directly from a June New York Daily News article. But thatarticle doesn't address the claim we're checking, that Florida is the first state requiring drug testing to receive welfare.For that, we turned to the Florida Senate'sfinal analysis, theNational Conference of State Legislaturesand theAmerican Civil Liberties Union.Florida's law deals with part of what used to be known as welfare: It's a cash assistance program funded by federal block grants called Temporary Assistance for Needy Families. Back in 1996, as part of federal welfare reform, the government told states they could use drug testing as part of eligibility for the block grant programs. (On the other hand, they weren't allowed to add new hurdles for collecting food.) Florida's law requires applicants for cash aid to pay for their own drug tests. If they pass, the cost of the testing is added to their benefits. If they fail, they're disqualified from cash aid for a year, though with drug abuse treatment they can reapply in six months. The caseload is nowdown 11 percentfrom September 2010.Was Florida the first to try such testing, more than a decade after welfare reform?The answer is no. Michigan instituted mandatory drug tests for all welfare applicants — in 1999. But that kind of suspicionless testing, without any reason to believe people were using drugs in the first place, was struck down in 2003 by a Michigan appeals court. That discouraged other states. So while many have considered more drug-testing since the '90s, very few have passed laws, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures, a bipartisan group that represents state lawmakers. A 2002 survey, for example, showed that a handful of states — such as Maryland, Minnesota, New Jersey and Wisconsin — tested only people who have been convicted of a drug felony.Still, the proposals, sometimespitched as a cost-saving measure, are popular. In 2009, more than 20 states proposed requiring drug tests as a condition of eligibility for public assistance, according to NCSL. In 2010, at least 12 did. No laws emerged. But this year, with at least 36 states considering drug-testing proposals, three are now law. In addition to Florida's mandatory suspicionless testing, Arizona and Missouri now screen applicants they have reasonable cause to believe are taking illegal drugs, though Arizona's requirement is temporary.Meanwhile, Florida's law — the first requiring testing regardless of suspicion since Michigan's program was struck down — is under legal challenge. TheACLU has suedFlorida to stop what it considers unreasonable and suspicionless searches that violate the Fourth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. Our rulingIn 1996, Congress said states could test welfare recipients for illegal drug use. In 1999, Michigan was the first state to require all applicants to take drug tests, regardless of suspicion. But that law was struck down as unconstitutional, discouraging other states from requiring similar testing. This year, Florida became the first state to try mandatory drug screening of all applicants after Michigan's legal loss, while Arizona and Missouri enacted laws to test applicants they suspect might use drugs. A chain e-mail claims, Florida is the first state requiring drug testing to receive welfare! It is the first one — since the last one, which was Michigan. Meanwhile, other states also require drug-testing for some applicants. We rule this e-mail's claim False.",0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,false

An Oct. 29, 2017,, post on Morning-Herald.com ran with the headline, Hillary Clinton leaves the country as Mueller indictment is announced. The same story appeared on other websites, too.  Facebook users flagged the story as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social networks efforts to curb the spread of fake news. The fake post said that Clinton and her husband, former President Bill Clinton, flew to Lviv, Ukraine, on Oct. 27, which was the same day a grand jury approved criminal charges in the Special Counsels Office investigation. The announcement of who was actually being indicted didnt come until Oct. 30, giving fake news purveyors a couple of days to peddle false stories. The story originated on Oct. 28 at FreedomJunkshun.com, which had written a series of posts implying Hillary Clinton was a potential target of Muellers probe. The site included a photograph of the Clintons at an airport, but that image was from the 2013 renaming of the airport in Little Rock, Ark., after the political power couple. The story notes that Ukraine has no extradition treaties with the United States, which is true. And Hillary Clinton has been to Lviv, but that was as first lady 20 years ago. In reality, Hillary Clinton was in Washington on Oct. 28, not Ukraine, for a speech at the Human Rights Campaigns national dinner. She was then in the Chicago suburbs on Oct. 30 to sign copies of her new book, What Happened. FreedomJunkshun.com is a member of a series of fake websites associated with Christopher Blair, who lives in Maine. Blair is a self-described liberal troll who creates fictional stories to try to fool conservative readers. The website uses a similar layout and style as other Blair-affiliated sites, and carries a disclaimer that reads, All people, places, names and images should be considered fictitious or fictitious representations. The real indictments were for President Donald Trumps former campaign chairman Paul Manafort and his associate Rick Gates, who pleaded not guilty to 12 counts of making false statements, money laundering and more. George Papadopoulos, a former Trump foreign policy adviser, also was indicted for lying to the FBI and pleaded guilty. This is another in a spate of fake news stories that claimed Democrats were among the people charged in the Mueller investigation",0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,false

Final Rating: False  ",Barack Obama wants to unilaterally disarm our nation.,"Anonymous e-mails claim that Sen. Barack Obama wants to unilaterally disarm our nation — and they say they have the video to prove it. You do not have to check Snopes to determine if this is true or false ... watch and listen to Obama's own words, warns one e-mail. Look at this ASAP — it may be pulled from the Obama Web site very soon, another e-mail states. This is shocking and reprehensible, opines a third e-mail. All the e-mails link to YouTube video that shows Barack Obama talking about his defense policies. The only problem is, Obama doesn't say in the video that he wants to disarm the United States. Rather, Obama talks about ending the war in Iraq, curtailing wasteful defense spending, and negotiating with Russia to reduce the U.S. nuclear arsenal. He says he wants a world without nuclear weapons, but as we'll explain shortly, that statement is well within the mainstream of U.S. foreign policy thought. We went looking for the source of the video and found it fairly quickly on the Obama campaign Web site. The official version includes opening and concluding remarks in which he emphasizes he will eliminate wasteful spending and make his sole priority protecting the American people. Obama's campaign created the video while campaigning to win the Iowa caucuses. Obama was seeking the endorsement of Caucus4Priorities, an Iowa-based advocacy movement that wants a portion of defense spending diverted to domestic issues like education and jobs. The group instead endorsed John Edwards. Here's Obama's statement in its entirety. We've noted where the edited version in the chain e-mails begins and ends: Thanks so much for the Caucus4Priorities, for the great work you've been doing. As president, I will end misguided defense policies and stand with Caucus4Priorities in fighting special interests in Washington. First, I'll stop spending $9-billion a month in Iraq. [Edited video starts.] I'm the only major candidate who opposed this war from the beginning, and as president, I will end it. Second, I will cut tens of billions of dollars in wasteful spending. I will cut investments in unproven missile defense systems. I will not weaponize space. I will slow our development of future combat systems, and I will institute an independent defense priorities board to ensure that the quadrennial defense review is not used to justify unnecessary spending. Third, I will set a goal of a world without nuclear weapons. To seek that goal, I will not develop new nuclear weapons. I will seek a global ban on the production of fissile material, and I will negotiate with Russia to take our ICBMs off hair-trigger alert and to achieve deep cuts in our nuclear arsenals. [Edited video ends.] You know where I stand. I've fought for open, ethical and accountable government my entire public life. I don't switch positions or make promises that can't be kept. I don't posture on defense policy, and I don't take money from federal lobbyists for powerful defense contractors. As president, my sole priority for defense spending will be protecting the American people. Thanks so much. We suspect that the phrase a world without nuclear weapons may have set off Obama's anonymous critics. Actually, that goal has been promoted by foreign policy experts on both sides of the political aisle. Obama's goal echoes an opinion piece published in theWall Street Journalon Jan. 4, 2007, authored by George P. Shultz, William J. Perry, Henry A. Kissinger and Sam Nunn. Its title: A World Free of Nuclear Weapons. The end of the Cold War made the doctrine of mutual Soviet-American deterrence obsolete, their essay said. Deterrence continues to be a relevant consideration for many states with regard to threats from other states. But reliance on nuclear weapons for this purpose is becoming increasingly hazardous and decreasingly effective. The piece then goes on to argue for similar points as Obama mentions in his statement, though in more detail. The authors have significant foreign policy experience: Shultz was was secretary of state under Ronald Reagan; Perry was defense secretary under Bill Clinton; Kissinger was secretary of state under Richard Nixon and Gerald Ford; and Nunn was chairman of the U.S. Senate Armed Services Committee. The piece kicked off enough discussion and debate in the foreign policy community that the quartet authored another piece for theWall Street Journala year later, titled Toward a Nuclear-Free World, in which they discussed growing support for their ideas. Not everyone agreed, of course. In May 2008, theWeekly Standardpublished a detailed critique of the policies by Gary J. Schmitt of the American Enterprise Institute and Henry Sokolski of the Nonproliferation Policy Education Center, who argued that their proposed solutions would be difficult to implement. For our fact-checking purposes, the point here is that Obama's statement falls firmly within the mainstream of the U.S. foreign policy debate. His position does not constitute unilateral disarmament, said John Pike, director of GlobalSecurity.org, a Web site that specializes in information about defense, the military, weapons of mass destruction and homeland security. He's advocating the abolition of nuclear weapons in general, not nuclear disarmament, Pike said. If you're going to disagree with him, you have to understand what you're disagreeing with. The notion of unilateral disarmament is pretty much a nonstarter for both major political parties, including Obama, he added. Outside of the religious pacifist community, that is just not a policy position that has had meaningful political support in the United States, Pike said. One of the outlets that has promoted the Obama-wants-to-disarm-us argument is the conservative blog Macsmind. Macsmind linked on Feb. 27, 2008, to a YouTube video; several of the e-mails we received linked to the Macsmind post. Macsmind posted the commentary, Sen. McCain, you should grab this video and play it on every ad you can. This is absolutely shocking reprehensible. He plans to universally disarm our nation (sic). The question is for what, and more specifically 'for whom'. On June 8, Macsmind posted a full version of the video, noting some lefties are complaining that the video is a hack job and it's out of context. Therefore I present to you context. Macsmind and others may not like the foreign policy goals that Obama outlines in his video, but it's deceptive to call those goals unilateral disarmament. For this reason, we find this the chain e-mail's statements to be False. ",0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,false

Final Rating: False",(New Jersey Network) is the only news station which covers New Jersey government.,"Sen. Loretta Weinberg may need to do some more channel surfing for news about government in New Jersey.After Gov. Chris Christie announced plans in early June to turn over control of the 40-year-old New Jersey Network to New York-based television station WNET, Democratic legislators called for a closer examination of the proposal. Assembly Democrats on Thursday rejected Christie's plans, however. As a result, the fate of the public broadcasting network is in limbo.Weinberg, a Democrat who represents Bergen County, raised concerns about the deal in a June 6 column on Bluejersey.com, calling it a give-away of one of our state's greatest assets.Using bold and italics in the following statement, Weinberg went on to say: NJN is the only news station which covers New Jersey government. Their public affairs and interview shows as well as the nightly news will be no longer. We still don't have the detail on this, and once the state report is officially released, the Legislature will have 15 days to respond or the give-away is considered approved.The only news station covering New Jersey government? It didnt take long for PolitiFact New Jersey to realize Weinberg was wrong.We found stories about New Jersey government on the websites of television stations based in the New York and Philadelphia areas. Some stories were written by the Associated Press, but others were covered by reporters working for those stations or their affiliates.Secaucus-based My9 News also runs a weekly political talk show called New Jersey Now. In fact, Weinberg appeared on that program on Feb. 6 to discuss the Passaic Valley Sewerage Commission.News 12 New Jersey provides news coverage for cable subscribers in northern and central parts of the state, as well as its weekly show, Power and Politics, and its monthly Capital Hotseat interviews.While other stations cover the metropolitan areas, NJN and News 12 are comparable in the amount of time devoted to New Jersey news, according to Lawrence Londino, chair of the Department of Broadcasting at Montclair State University.Its certainly not the only game in town, said Londino, referring to NJN.Weinberg acknowledged in a phone interview that other stations provide news coverage and said she could have been more articulate in her statement. She maintained that NJN is the only network providing regular nightly news shows focused on New Jersey government.I knew what was in my mind, said Weinberg, before referring to News 12 New Jersey: Whatever news they cover is very sporadic.Janice Selinger, the acting executive director at NJN, also argued that News 12s coverage is not comparable to NJN.Other people do cover state government. They dont cover it as extensively as we do and they dont cover it for the whole state, Selinger said. Were not just there when the story breaks. Were there every day.The NJN News broadcast appears at three regular times each weekday night, and other news programs such as On the Record appear on weekends. News 12 New Jersey runs a live broadcast for a total of nine and a half hours each weekday, and then two live newscasts on Saturday and Sunday.In a statement, News 12 New Jersey General Manager and News Director Randal Stanley responded to Weinbergs comments.With a full-time news bureau at the State Capitol, News 12 is dedicated to providing New Jerseys communities and its local residents with daily coverage of events and issues on state government and other important topics, according to the statement. In addition, News 12's election season includes live coverage on election night, a schedule of political debates, live coverage of the State of the State address, plus inaugurations, town hall meetings, and more.Lets review:Weinberg said NJN is the only news station which covers New Jersey government, but other television stations clearly cover government in the Garden State through news and political talk shows.Weinberg later praised the extent of coverage provided by NJN, but her statement was not about comparing coverage among different news stations.

Final Rating: False  ",Harry Reids plan is basically giving the president a blank check.,"In a recent television interview, House Majority Leader Eric Cantor boldly predicted that Republicans in his chamber would unite to pass Speaker John Boehners plan to lift the nations debt ceiling.Cantor, R-7th, said House Republicans were concluding that Boehners plan is their best option to cut federal spending while ensuring, at least temporarily, that the U.S. continues to pay back its loans.Cantor dismissed as unacceptable the option of not increasing the $14.3 trillion debt limit by Aug. 2, when the nation will start running short of funds to pay its obligations. He was scornful of a proposal by Sen. Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., to raise the debt limit.Harry Reids plan is basically giving the president a blank check, giving him what he wants, a blind increase of the debt ceiling to spend the money the way he wants, Cantor said during a July 26 interview on Fox News.We wondered whether Reids plan really would present President Barack Obama a blank check -- a claim repeatedly made by Cantor and Boehner. First, a little background. Reids proposal would raise the debt ceiling by $2.7 trillion, enough to last until 2013. Boehners two-step planwould allow the limit to increase by $900 billion now and force Obama to seek a second hike before next years elections.Both proposals claim to cut spending by $1.2 trillion over the next 10 years. Neither plan seeks a tax increase. Boehner would require Congress to vote on a balanced budget amendment; Reid would not.We asked asked Megan Whittemore, Cantors deputy press secretary, to explain the majority leaders factual basis for calling Reids plan a blank check for Obama.We are confident that your readers will understand the common meaning of the metaphor of a `blank check, she e-mailed back to us. However, to help you along we first turn to About.com in the grammar section where you will find the following helpful.Whittemore pasted in a three-paragraph definition that began, A figure of speech is a rhetorical device that achieves a special effect by using words in distinctive ways. It said, among other things, that sometimes people rely on hyperbole to emphasize a point (`Im starving!).She also sent us two definitions of blank check. One, by Dictionary.com, defines it as unrestricted authority; a free hand.Another, by Wikipedia, says blank check in the figurative or metaphoric sense, is used (especially in politics) to describe a situation in which an agreement had been made that is open-ended or vague, and therefore subject to abuse.Whittemore noted that Boehners two-step plan would require Congress to hit spending-cut goals before Obama could ask Congress for the second increase in the debt. That, Republicans say, would put more pressure on Washington to reduce spending than Reids proposal, which would allow a larger, longer-lasting hike in the debt cap.We ran Cantors blank check analogy by four Washington policy analysts who are closely watching the debt ceiling debate. They were all perplexed by the statement and pointed out a simple reason why Reids plan would not give Obama carte blanche: Under the U.S. Constitution, only Congress can appropriate money.Congress has to authorize new spending and changes in taxation, said Norman J. Ornstein, a political scientist with the conservative American Enterprise Institute. The president can sign or veto those bills. He cant do anything without congressional authority.Ornstein added, Cantor is being totally, deliberately misleading.Steve Ellis, vice-president of the non-partisan Taxpayers for Common Sense, had a similar take. Rep. Cantors comment isnt really correct, he said.We were also given a second reason why Cantors statement is inaccurate: Raising the debt limit will pay for past obligations made by the U.S. government, not new ones.The need to raise the debt limit is a factor of past spending and tax decision (in addition to the recent economic downturn) enacted by previous congresses and presidents pushing borrowing needs up, said Jason Peuquet, an analyst with the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a middle-of-the-road, budget-hawk group.Lets review:Cantor said Senate Majority Leader Reids proposal to raise the debt ceiling would be basically giving the president a blank check, giving him what he wants, a blind increase of the debt ceiling to spend the money the way he wants.A number of policy analysts told us Cantors statement is simply incorrect. Only Congress can appropriate money. Obama can only spend what hes given. Reids plan does not change that constitutional requirement.Cantors office failed to provide a single fact to back the Republicans contention that Reids proposal would give the president a free hand in spending. Cantors spokeswoman said he was speaking metaphorically and people understand that. We find that logic hard to accept, particularly at a time of great public divide when the financial integrity of the nation is at stake.",0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,false

Final Rating: False","In Japan, permanent residency is not given to Muslims, the propagation of Islam is banned, one cannot import a Koran published in the Arabic language, and Muslims cannot even rent a house.","Amid rising concerns about terrorist attacks by ISIS, weve seen an uptick in chain emails and viral images about Islam. One viral image points to Japan as an example of a country that keeps out radical Islam by cracking down on all forms of Islam and its adherents, implying that this is a good model for the United States to follow. The graphic is a simple black-and-white block of text with the headline, Japan keeps Islam at bay by putting restrictions on Islam and ALL Muslims. The graphic then mentions a variety of ways in which Japan supposedly keeps tight control over the Muslims in its midst: • Japan is the only nation that does not give citizenship to Muslims • Permanent residency is not given to Muslims • Propagation of Islam in Japan is banned • In the University of Japan, Arabic or any Islamic language is not taught • Japan is the only country in the world with a negligible number of embassies in Islamic countries • One cannot import a Koran published in the Arabic language • Muslims must follow Japanese law and language. • The Japanese government is of the opinion that Muslims are fundamentalist, and unwilling to change their Muslim laws • Muslims cannot even rent a house in Japan • There is no sharia law in Japan We wondered whether the graphic is accurate. To streamline our analysis, we focused mostly on these four claims -- that in Japan, permanent residency is not given to Muslims, the propagation of Islam is banned, one cannot import a Koran published in the Arabic language, and Muslims cannot even rent a house.  We heard back from three experts who have experience with the intersection of Japan and Islam, and all three said the graphic is blatantly incorrect. The chain email is nothing but malicious falsehood, said Kumiko Yagi, a professor at the Tokyo University of Foreign Studies Graduate School who has written extensively about Islam and other religions. Kamada Shigeru, a professor of Islamic studies at the University of Tokyo, agreed, saying that all four of the claims we spotlighted are wrong. He said Japan doesnt discriminate in permanent residency on the basis of religion and that propagation of Islam is not banned. He added that the Koran or other religious books in Arabic can be imported. As for renting a residence, he said there may be some reluctance among residents of Japan to rent apartments to foreigners as a general rule, but he said theres no specific animus toward Muslims. These four claims are totally unfounded, said Glenda S. Roberts, a professor of cultural anthropology and Japanese studies at the graduate school of Asia-Pacific Studies at Waseda University in Tokyo. It is disturbing that such an email is circulating, she added. These claims are simply ridiculous. Other claims in the graphic are easily debunked. For instance, the graphic claims that Japan is the only country in the world with a negligible number of embassies in Islamic countries. Yet a quick visit to the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs website shows that Japan has embassies in such countries as Afghanistan, Bahrain, Iran, Iraq, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Syria, Turkey, the United Arab Emirates and Yemen, plus a permanent representative to the Palestinian Authority. Meanwhile, there is nothing in Japanese nationality law that prevents Muslims from becoming naturalized citizens. The requirements concern length of residency, age, a history of upright conduct, the ability to support oneself and a willingness to give up other nationalities. There is no mention of religion. As for universities not teaching Arabic, we found that the Tokyo University of Foreign Studies does. Classes in Arabic are also taught at the Arabic Islamic Institute in Tokyo. Last year, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe made clear Japans respect for people of the Islamic faith during an event with the Islamic diplomatic corps. I have found that a fundamental aspect of the spirit of Islam is harmony with and love for others, Abe said. I believe therein lie points of commonality with the Japanese spirit, which is founded on co-existence. Our ruling The graphic says that in Japan, permanent residency is not given to Muslims, the propagation of Islam is banned, one cannot import a Koran published in the Arabic language, and Muslims cannot even rent a house. Each of these four statements is incorrect, and the overall point of the graphic -- that Japan keeps itself free from radical Islam by discriminating against all Muslims -- is dramatically off-base.",0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,false

Final Rating: False  ",Forty percent of the guns in this country are sold without any background checks.,"Like many other politicians before him, U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., repeated a false claim that 40 percent of guns are sold without a background checks. We have to end the absurdity of the gun show loophole, Sanders said Feb. 18 on NBCsMeet the Press. Forty percent of the guns in this country are sold without any background checks. Three years after we first debunked this statistic, its still not true. The statistic comes from a 20-year-old study by the National Institute of Justice that looked at gun owners responses to a 1994 national survey asking how they got their weapons. The study found that 30 percent to 40 percent of all gun transactions were made through an off-the-books transfer in which a background check wasnt required. The finding has been cited widely by gun control advocates. Former Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe earned a Mostly False when he used it, and a Florida gun control advocate earned a False in 2017 after the finding was diminished by new research. The latest researchsuggests the percentage is almost half of what Sanders cited. The sample size of the 1997 study was very small, with just 251 participants. Furthermore, the statistic stems from survey data that included firearms given as gifts or inheritances, not just sales. This is an important point. When the authors of the NIJ study — Jens Ludwig of the University of Chicago and Philip Cook of Duke University — adjusted the results to include only the guns sold (not given), the number sold without background checks declined to between 14 percent and 22 percent. That statistic more closely resembles the new findings in a relatively new 2017 study. Researchers Matthew Miller, Lisa Hepburn, and Deborah Azrael published a study in the January 2017 edition of the journal Annals of Internal Medicine that was specifically undertaken to update the 1994 data. The researchers asked 1,613 adult gun owners where and when they acquired their last firearm, including whether it was purchased, and whether they had either a background check or were asked to show a firearm license or permit. The answer: 22 percent obtained their gun without a background check. Thats about half of the 40 percent figure that has gained wide currency for more than two decades. In fact, Cook wrote an accompanying editorial in the journal, headlined, At last, a good estimate of the magnitude of the private-sale loophole for firearms. In it, he wrote, Even though I bear some credit (or blame) for the earlier estimate, I could not be more pleased to be done with it, given that it is based on data from a survey done more than 20 years ago and that, in any event, never directly asked participants about background checks. It appears the number he cited may be outdated, Sanders spokesman Josh Miller-Lewis told PolitiFact Florida in an email. But whether its 40 percent or 22 percent of guns being acquired without a background check, millions of Americans still obtain guns without background checks. That's absurd. No one should be allowed to purchase a gun without a vigorous background check. Sanders said, Forty percent of the guns in this country are sold without any background checks. That statistic is outdated. It stems from a 20-year-old survey that has been overtaken by another study that shows that 22 percent of gun buyers obtained their weapons without background checks. Thats just over half the percentage in the zombie claim Sanders cited.",0.0,0.9,1.0,0.5,0.0,0.5,0.7,0.9,0.8,false

Final Rating: False  ","In the weekend after the terrorist attacks in Paris, the White House said this couldn't happen in the United States. ISIS couldn't reach us here.","President Barack Obama seems clueless on the threat of the Islamic State, said MSNBCs Joe Scarborough. First of all he wont even call it Islamic radicalism, Scarborough said on Morning Joe Dec. 4, the day after the deadly terrorist attack in San Bernardino, Calif. His White House said, the weekend of Paris, that this couldn't happen in the United States. ISIS couldn't reach us here. Its accurate that Obama doesnt call ISIS Islamic radicalism or Islamic extremism. A reader asked us to look into the second part of Scarboroughs statement: that in the days following the Friday, Nov. 13 terrorist attack in Paris, the Obama administration said an ISIS attack couldnt happen in the United States. An MSNBC spokesperson directed us to comments made by Ben Rhodes, a deputy national security adviser, on ABCs This Week on Nov. 15. But they dont back up Scarboroughs claim in the least. In the interview, Rhodes said there was no known credible threat to the United States at that moment. He did not say there wasnt any possibility of ISIS-backed terrorism on U.S. soil whatsoever. Rhodes immediately followed up by pointing out that ISIS has aspirations to attack the United States. Host George Stephanopoulos: And is there any intelligence suggesting a specific and credible threat to the homeland? I know yesterday there was none. Has anything new developed there? Rhodes: No, George, the president had a meeting yesterday that included the secretary of Homeland Security, the director of the FBI. Our determination is there's not a specific, credible threat to the homeland at this time. But we're going to be very vigilant because we know ISIL has the aspirations to attack the United States as well as our European and other allies and partners. Rhodes added later that one focus of Obamas meetings with foreign leaders that weekend was how we can seal that border with Turkey to prevent that flow of foreign fighters and share intelligence to disrupt and prevent attacks in our European allies' countries and, of course, in the United States. So this Rhodes interview doesnt support Scarboroughs point; rather, Rhodes plainly admits that there is a threat of an ISIS attack in the United States. We looked at other White House statements from around that time and didnt find anything else to back Scarborough up. Obama delivered a brief statement on Nov. 13 about the terrorist attack in Paris, but he did not address the possibility of terrorist attacks in the United States. At that time, ISISs involvement was unclear. In Nov. 15 remarks in Ankara, Turkey, Obama expressed solidarity with France and spoke about the fight against ISIS in the Middle East but did not discuss the potential for attacks in the United States. In a Nov. 16 press conference, also in Turkey, Obama delivered a similar message, but he also explicitly addressed the possibility of terrorist attacks on our soil. There are certain advantages that the United States has in preventing these kinds of attacks. Obviously, after 9/11, we hardened the homeland, set up a whole series of additional steps to protect aviation, to apply lessons learned. Weve seen much better cooperation between the FBI, state governments, local governments. There is some advantages to geography with respect to the United States. But, having said that, weve seen the possibility of terrorist attacks on our soil. There was the Boston Marathon bombers. Obviously, it did not result in the scale of death that we saw in Paris, but that was a serious attempt at killing a lot of people by two brothers and a crockpot. And it gives you some sense of, I think, the kinds of challenges that are going to be involved in this going forward. So in the weekend immediately following the Paris attacks, it doesnt seem that any White House official dismissed the possibility of an ISIS attack on U.S. soil. Our ruling Scarborough said that in the weekend after the terrorist attacks in Paris, the White House said this couldn't happen in the United States. ISIS couldn't reach us here. Obama and Rhodes, an adviser, both spoke of the Islamic States aspirations to attack the United States in the two or three days following the Paris attacks. They talked about what the government is doing to prevent the group from carrying out its plans. Neither ruled out the possibility that ISIS could stage an attack on U.S. soil, nor did any other White House official.",0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,false

Final Rating: False  ","Since 1965, the United States has spent untold trillions yet the poverty rate hasnt budged.","On July 26, 2011, Fox News host Bill OReilly took aim at government efforts to aid the poor, suggesting that they were not only a contributor to the nations current debt problems but that they also werent effective on their own terms.What the debt situation is really, really all about is your right to pursue happiness, OReilly said. America is the greatest country on earth because it gives the most people the most opportunity to prosper. It does that by using the free marketplace whereby people can work hard, make money and provide for themselves and their families.But since the mid-1960s, America has practiced social engineering. Spending tax money directly, trying to improve the lives of those who don't have very much. Those payments are called entitlements. And they are now so high they threaten to bankrupt the entire nation. Liberal Americans tend to support the entitlement society while conservatives are more inclined to promote individualism and smaller entitlement spending.President (Barack) Obama, of course, is a liberal. And the Democratic Party is now dominated by the left. That's why in the past two and a half years federal spending has broken the bank. ...The essential mistake that Barack Obama is making is that he believes Lyndon Johnson's Great Society entitlements can elevate the poor to prosperity. They can't. In 1965, the poverty rate in this country stood at 14 percent. Now, after untold trillions have been spent fighting poverty, the poverty rate is 14.3 percent. Amazing, is it not? The conclusion, America is bankrupting itself with an entitlement philosophy that does little.A reader asked us to look at OReillys statement. It covers a lot of ground, but the part we were interested in analyzing was his claim that since 1965, the United States has spent untold trillions, yet the poverty rate hasnt budged.First, some background on the Great Society. It was an agenda put forward by Johnson after he was elevated to president upon the assassination of President John F. Kennedy. He was able to enact various parts of the agenda after winning a landslide victory in 1964. It included such ongoing programs as Medicare, Medicaid, the Elementary and Secondary Education Act; and Head Start. It also included such defunct efforts as the Office of Economic Opportunity, which spearheaded localized anti-poverty efforts.Gary Burtless, an economist with the centrist-to-liberal Brookings Institution, cautions that OReillys comment overlooks the actual purpose of the Great Society programs, which wasnt to boost incomes directly, in a way that would be detectable in poverty statistics, but rather to improve the health care, nutrition and educational attainment or performance of Americans.If the programs were successful, Burtless said, it was because they improved the health care received by the old and poor, they improved the schooling received by disadvantaged youngsters and they improved the nutritional quality of the diets of the poor. These programs may eventually have reduced money poverty, but only if improving medical care, educational attainment and nutritional intake has an indirect effect that reduces money poverty.That said, well take OReillys statement on its own terms and offer our critique.• He uses the wrong numbers. The poverty rate -- the percentage of Americans whose income is lower than the federally determined poverty line -- was 17.3 percent in 1965, not 14 percent. For 2009, OReilly is correct -- the rate was 14.3 percent.So if you compare the poverty rate in those two years, it has fallen by 3 percentage points, or by about one-sixth its original level. It didnt stay roughly constant, as OReilly claimed.• The poverty rate has fallen even further if you start counting a few years before the Great Society began. Between 1959 and 1962, the poverty rate ranged between 20 and 22 percent. If you compare that level to 2009, poverty declined by an even steeper rate -- by more than one-third.• The most recent recession has affected the numbers. We have no quarrel with O'Reilly using the 2009 figure as his endpoint -- its the most recent figure available -- but as long as he has chosen it, well provide some important context. That year came within the midst of the Great Recession, and recessions typically lead to spikes in poverty.By simply moving the endpoint two years earlier, to 2007, you would get an endpoint of 12.5 percent. So if you compare poverty rates in 1965 and 2007, the rate dropped by nearly five percentage points during that period, or by almost one-third.• Poverty among the elderly has plummeted. In 1967, about 30 percent of seniors were below the poverty line. That was down to 13.2 percent by 2008 -- a reduction by more than half.One of Johnsons greatest legislative achievements -- Medicare, the federal health care program for those 65 years and over -- helped lower elderly poverty, as did Social Security, a program that started under President Franklin D. Roosevelt but which Johnson enhanced with legislation in 1965 and 1967. A subsequent law enacted in 1973 began automatic, annual cost-of-living adjustments for Social Security beneficiaries. To the extent that Medicaid also helps poor older Americans, that has helped as well.All three of these programs, we should add, certainly qualify as entitlements that OReilly targets in his comment.• Certain subgroups have seen steep drops in poverty over the same period. Poverty among blacks was 55 percent in 1959 and 41 percent in 1966. By 2009, the rate had fallen to 25.9 percent. For black single moms without a father present, the poverty rate fell from 70.6 percent in 1959 and 65.3 in 1966 to 39.8 percent in 2009.Many Americans would say that 25.9 percent of blacks and 39.8 percent of black single mothers in poverty is still too high. Still the rates are still down dramatically over the period OReilly is referring to.Meanwhile, Hispanic poverty is up a few points since 1972 (the earliest year for which we have data) but poverty among Hispanic single moms with no father present has fallen from 53.5 percent in 1972 to 40.6 percent in 2009.• Alternate measurements of poverty show even steeper declines than the official statistics. A number of statisticians led by Douglas Besharov -- a University of Maryland scholar previously with the conservative American Enterprise Institute -- have come up with a more detailed measure of poverty that they say is more accurate than the official government statistic. Their alternative statistic includes factors ignored in the official statistics but which help poor Americans make it from day to day.Heres a rundown of the changes the Besharov group suggests, along with their impact on the poverty rate.Using a corrected inflation adjustment (to correct what they believe was an error in the 1970s): Lowers the poverty rate by 2 percentage points.Counting funds received from the Earned Income Tax Credit: Lowers the poverty rate by about 0.5 percentage points.Including the income of other people living in the same home: Lowers the poverty rate by 1 percentage point.Imputing income from the wealth in highly appreciated homes, a factor most important for poor elderly Americans: Lowers the poverty rate by 0.6 percentage pointsTreating food stamps, housing assistance, and free- or reduced-price school lunches as the equivalent of income: Lowers the poverty rate by about 1.3 percentage points. (This does, however, exclude the value of Medicaid, which Besharov estimated at roughly $3,225 per person.)Correcting for under-reporting of transfer payments: Lowers the poverty rate by about 0.8 percentage points.Correcting for the under-reporting of other types income: Lowers the poverty rate by about 1.6 percentage points.The grand total of these reductions is 7.8 percentage points, which would reduce the current poverty rate from 14.3 percent to 6.5 percent.We ran all of our critiques by a number of independent experts, including both liberals and conservatives, and they agreed that O'Reilly was incorrect. We also contacted The O'Reilly Factor, and a spokesman said the show plans to correct the record on its Monday, Aug. 1 show. This is not to say that OReilly is entirely wrong. Present levels of entitlements may not be sustainable, as he suggests. OReilly might be right that relatively few of the poor have been lifted into prosperity, as opposed to somewhere slightly above the poverty line. And the final 14 percent of Americans may be the most difficult to lift out of poverty, suggesting that at some point the cost-benefit ratio for anti-poverty expenditures may become harder to defend.The issue of whether were spending these social welfare dollars well, particularly on the margin, is an important one, and I think many people with very different political persuasions would agree we are not, said Eugene Steuerle, a fellow with the Urban Institute, a nonpartisan think tank.Still, the official statistics show that poverty has declined over the years -- indeed, quite steeply for certain groups -- and at least one unofficial estimate shows even lower rates today. The exact roles played in this decline by Medicare, Medicaid, the mid-1960s Social Security changes, food stamps and Head Start are uncertain, but its almost impossible to believe that they deserve no credit at all for the improved numbers. OReilly said the Great Society programs did nothing to reduce poverty, but we rule that claim False.",0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,false

Final Rating: False  ",ISIS leader Abu Bakr al Baghdadi was released by Obama in 2009.,"The march of the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, or ISIS, across a swath of Iraq has fractured a nation and spurred Republican attacks that the Obama administration is on the verge of snatching defeat from the jaws of victory. Fox News host Jeanine Pirro tied President Barack Obama to the roots of the current assault. On June 14, Pirro offered listeners this insight into the ISIS leader. (ISIS is also called ISIL, for Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant.) The head of this band of savages is a man named Abu Bakr al Baghdadi, the new Osama Bin Laden, Pirro said. A man released by Obama in 2009, who started ISIS a year later. And when Baghdadi left Camp Bucca, where the worst of the worst were held in Iraq, he threatened his American jailers saying, Ill see you in New York.  A reader wanted to know if Obama actually released Baghdadi, and we decided to look into it. Whatever the truth, the assertion has gained traction. For the presidents critics this fits with their disdain for the recent prisoner swap that freed Army Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl in exchange for five Taliban leaders who had been kept at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. Red State, a conservative blog, used the Baghdadi connection to talk about Obamas catch-and-release policy. We have two elements to verify. Was Baghdadi in U.S. custody in 2009 and did Obama have a direct connection to his release? Well deal with them in order. Will the real Abu Bakr al Baghdadi please stand up There have been several articles -- from Slate, and NBC among others -- that place Baghdadi at a detention facility in Iraq called Camp Bucca in 2009 (when Obama would have been president). However, all the talk tracks back to a Daily Beast interview with Army Col. Kenneth King, the former commander of Camp Bucca. That article said King knew Baghdadi at the camp and that he didnt expect to see him become the leader of a spectacularly vicious and brutal movement. Im not surprised that it was someone who spent time in Bucca but Im a little surprised it was him, King said. He was a bad dude, but he wasnt the worst of the worst. In this storyline, Baghdadi was handed over to Iraqi justice system late in 2009 shortly before Camp Bucca closed. However, when PunditFact asked the Defense Department to confirm the story, officials there said Baghdadi was released in 2004, not 2009. Ibrahim Awad Ibrahim Al Badry, also known as Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi was held as a civilian internee by U.S. Forces-Iraq from early February 2004 until early December 2004, when he was released, the Pentagon said in a statement. He was held at Camp Bucca. A Combined Review and Release Board recommended unconditional release of this detainee and he was released from U.S. custody shortly thereafter. We have no record of him being held at any other time. In short, according to the Defense Department, the man who heads ISIS was released in 2004, long before Obama took office, and was not recaptured. ABC News also has questioned Kings recollection, citing a a U.S. official that Baghdadi was not in American custody in 2009. I could be mistaken, King told ABC News, but Im 99 percent. Hes a dead ringer for the guy I had the run-in with  His face is very familiar. King declined to comment to PunditFact. A troubled detention policy If Baghdadi wasnt in American custody in 2009 as Defense Department officials say, then theres no way Obama could be to blame. But even if he was, the link between the ISIS leader and the American president are flimsy because the framework was set in in 2008 while George W. Bush was president. A little backstory. By July 2005, the United States had four detention facilities -- two near Baghdad, one in the northeastern corner of the country, and Camp Bucca in the far southeastern corner near the Kuwait border. The entire operation was known as Task Force 134. In the course of the war, some 80,000 people passed through these centers, according to the Defense Department. A Pentagon-commissioned study by RAND, a private policy analysis group, described a system that struggled with competing expectations. The incoming population was a mix of captured Sunni and Shiite militants, people rounded up in military raids and ordinary criminals. At times, a blend of overcrowding and sectarian animosities led to riots. The RAND study also said the 2007 surge -- the addition of 20,000 new troops into Iraq to quell spreading unrest -- pushed detainee levels to over 25,000 people. From 2007-08, Navy Captain Brian J. Bill served as the legal adviser to Detainee Operations for the Multi-National Force in Iraq. Bill described the process of vetting inmates in the U.S. Naval War College journal, International Law Studies. The military established nine review boards, working six days a week, to hear 20 cases each day. Bill reported that when the boards first began they released about 25 percent of the individuals who came before them. Later, that rose to 40 percent. The end of the detention policy At the end Bushs second term in 2008, American and Iraqi negotiators moved toward getting the United States out of the business of holding large numbers of Iraqis. Robert Chesney, professor of international security law at the University of Texas School of Law, said neither side wanted to see the network of detention centers continue. Its demise reflected a deliberate policy choice by the United States and Iraq to phase out that system and to rely instead on the Iraqi criminal justice system as the sole mechanism for detention going forward, Chesney wrote in 2011. That goal became part of the U.S.-Iraq Status of Forces Agreement, signed in November 2008. Under that agreement the United States agreed to turn over custody of such wanted detainees to Iraqi authorities pursuant to a valid Iraqi arrest warrant and shall release all the remaining detainees in a safe and orderly manner. The United Statescontinued to hold about 200 prisoners judged to pose the greatest risk. They were what remained from a group that numbered about 14,000 at the start of 2009. Aside from the so-called Deck of Cards detainees held at Camp Cropper (the top leaders in Saddam Husseins government), its hard to imagine how anyone in Washington would have any interest in who we held or released, Bill told PunditFact. By the end of 2009, its hard to imagine how we could have continued to hold anyone if the Iraqis themselves didnt decide to detain them. Our ruling Pirro said that Obama released the current head of ISIS from government custody in 2009. The Defense Department said that the man now known as Baghdadi was released in 2004. The evidence that Baghdadi was still in custody in 2009 appears to be the recollection of an Army colonel who said Baghdadis face is very familiar. Even if the colonel is right, Baghdadi was not set free; he was handed over to the Iraqis who released him some time later. But more important, the legal contract between the United States and Iraq that guaranteed that the United States would give up custody of virtually every detainee was signed during the Bush administration. It would have required an extraordinary effort to have held on to Baghdadi and there is no evidence that he was on anyones radar screen, assuming that he was in custody at all in 2009. The U.S.-Iraq agreement drove the release of thousands of detainees in 2009, but Obama had nothing to do with that.",0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,false

Final Rating: False  ",Says H.R. 1 gives immigrants illegally in the country the right to vote.,"Some social media users are spreading a misleading claim about a Democratic proposal to expand voting rights. They claim that the bill, H.R. 1, gives immigrants illegally in the country the right to vote. For all of you who cant think for yourself on the left  you cry endlessly about foreign interference yet youre totally ok with allowing ILLEGALS the right to vote by backing H.R. 1, reads an Instagram post. The post was flagged as part of Facebooks efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The bills goal is to make it easier for eligible American citizens to register to vote. It doesnt change federal law that bars noncitizens from voting in federal elections. Nothing in the proposed statute would make it legal for noncitizens to register and/or vote, said Rebecca Green, professor and co-director of the Election Law Program at William & Mary Law School. There are federal and state criminal sanctions prohibiting noncitizens from registering and voting, which H.R. 1 does nothing to disturb. The Instagram post doesnt include any evidence for its assertions. But claims that the legislation would allow noncitizens to vote have often revolved around its provisions about automatic voter registration. Under the bill, people interacting with government offices — such as a motor-vehicle  or public-assistance agency — will have their information forwarded to election officials for registration purposes, unless they opt out. But nothing about this automatic registration allows noncitizens to vote or register to vote. The bill specifically says that only eligible citizens will be registered under this provision. If a persons citizenship status isnt on file at the government office, that person will have to fill out a registration form attesting to their citizenship. Noncitizens who falsify their citizenship status on one of these applications would be risking criminal sanction, Green said. Those who violate the law by voting or registering to vote can face incarceration, deportation or fines. Nearly 20 states and the District of Columbia have already either passed or implemented automatic voter registration, according to the Brennan Center for Justice. There is no evidence that these options have led to significant numbers of noncitizens becoming registered to vote, Danielle Lang, a voting expert at the Campaign Legal Center, previously told PolitiFact. Opponents of H.R. 1 have pointed to a glitch in Californias automatic voter registration program in 2018, which erroneously registered thousands of people to vote, including at least one noncitizen. Officials said that the error resulted from a programming flaw, and that they canceled the registrations and fixed the system. Any mail-in ballots sent to people who were mistakenly registered werent counted on Election Day. H.R. 1 also contains a provision stating that ineligible immigrants registered in error like the noncitizen in California cant be prosecuted for their immigration status. But anybody who lies during registration or intentionally misleads officials could still face prosecution. An Instagram post says that H.R. 1 would give immigrants illegally in the country the right to vote. The bill doesnt do that. H.R. 1 keeps in place federal and state criminal laws that prohibit noncitizens from voting or registering to vote. This claim is False.",0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,false

Final Rating: False  ",I have consistently opposed shutdowns.,"With an end to the federal government shutdown in sight, Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, tried to argue that, contrary to popular belief, he was not the driving force behind the previous government shutdown in 2013. Back in 2013, Cruz -- then a junior member of the Senates minority party -- had tried to end funding for the Affordable Care Act. He pushed for language to defund Obamacare in spending bills, which would have forced then-President Barack Obama to choose between keeping the government open and crippling his signature legislative achievement. As the high-stakes legislative game played out, Obama and his fellow Democrats refused to agree to gut the law, and the Republicans, as a minority party, didnt have the numbers to force their will. Following a 16-day shutdown, lawmakers voted to fund both the government and the Affordable Care Act. Cruz was widely identified at the time as the leader ofthe defunding effort. Most famously, Cruz spoke about defunding Obamacare on the Senate floor during a 21-hour speech, punctuated by Green Eggs and Ham as a bedtime story for his children. Many in Cruzs own party, even those sympathetic with his goals, blamed him for a tactical blunder. During the spending impasse, his Republican colleagues launched a barrage of hostile questions at a GOP-only lunch, questioning whether Cruz had thought through the endgame. By the time Cruz was running for president in 2016, some Republicans were willing to criticize his approach publicly. Grover Norquist, an influential anti-tax activist, told the Washington Post in 2016 that Cruzs shutdown plan was like a plotline in TVs South Park in which a group of gnomes comes up with a nonsense plot to become rich. Josh Holmes, a former aide to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., told the Post that Cruzs approach was like a toddlers version of legislating. Leading up to the 2018 shutdown, Cruzs role in the 2013 budget impasse received fresh media coverage, since he was now in the Senate majority. Would he be able to reconcile his past tactics with his current urgings not to shut down the government? This came to a head during a Senate hallway exchange between Cruz and reporter Kasie Hunt that aired on MSNBC on Jan. 22, 2018: Cruz: We should not be shutting the government down. I have consistently opposed shutdowns. In 2013, I said we shouldn't shut the government down. Indeed, I went to the Senate floor repeatedly asking unanimous consent to reopen the government. Hunt: Sir, you stood in the way of that. Cruz: That's factually incorrect. It's a wonderful media narrative, but only one thing causes a shutdown: when you have senators vote to deny cloture on a funding bill. And when that bill comes up, you have a vote. A yes means fund the government, a no means don't fund the government. In 2013, virtually every single Republican voted to fund the government, including me multiple times. In fact, every single Democrat I believe in 2013 voted to shut the government down. The same thing is true here. Virtually every single Republican voted this week to fund the government. Virtually every single Democrat voted to shut it down. Hunt: Sir, that's simply not the case. This was about Obamacare funding Cruz: Those facts are incorrect. ... I get that you want to debate me, but you don't actually have any facts. Cruzs argument that he didnt cause a shutdown is one he and his camp has made in the past. In his 2015 book, A Time for Truth,Cruz wrote that neither he nor his ally, Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, nor the House Republicans even once voted to shut down the government. To the contrary, over and over again we voted to fund the government. And in the 2016 Post article, then-Cruz campaign spokesman Rick Tyler said the senator didnt pursue a government shutdown strategy. Thats not even sane. That would be a good thing to go out and campaign on? That wasnt what he did. He led the fight to defund Obamacare. This echoes the framing Cruz offered Hunt -- namely, that his motivation was not to keep the government from being funded, but rather to defund Obamacare, and that the only reason people believe this is because of the biased media. However, even if, for the sake of argument, you accept Cruzs line of thinking, his hallway comments offered a very specific definition of determining whether a lawmaker had consistently opposed shutdowns. Specifically, Cruz said that only one thing causes a shutdown: when you have senators vote to deny cloture on a funding bill. Cloture refers to a Senate vote to cut off debate and proceed to a bill; its a prerequisite for considering a bill, and these days, it typically takes 60 votes. So did Cruz ever vote to deny cloture on a funding bill? He did. It came on the legislation to end the 16-day shutdown -- a bill that didnt include the Obamacare defunding language that he had been seeking. If this spending bill didnt pass, the government wouldnt be funded and would have to remain closed. As it happened, the bill passed by a large bipartisan majority, but Cruz was one of 16 senators to vote against cloture. He was also one of 18 to vote against the bill itself. By doing the one thing that he himself said defines causing a shutdown, Cruz didn't consistently oppose shutdowns. When he knew everyone else would vote to end the shutdown, he voted against funding the government, said Josh Ryan, a political scientist at Utah State University and author of the forthcoming book The Lawmaking End Game: Bargaining and Resolution in Congress. Cruz campaign spokeswoman Catherine Frazier told PolitiFact that his goal was to defund Obamacare, not shut down the government, and that is the point he was making today. He voted several times and fought in the face of (Democratic)oppositionto fund vital government services -- including the military, veterans benefits, the National Guard, and National Health Institute --while working to defund Obamacare before it went into effect, at which point he knew it would be markedly more difficult to undo. Sen. Cruz voted against cloture on the final bill because it still funded Obamacare, and he was committed to continuing the debate to defund it, while supporting bills to fund the other functions of government not impacted by Obamacare. Cruz said, I have consistently opposed shutdowns. Debunking this assertion doesnt even require leveraging the many Republican statements criticizing Cruzs legislative tactics for prompting the 2013 government shutdown. It only requires using the standard Cruz laid out in the same interview -- that only one thing causes a shutdown: when you have senators vote to deny cloture on a funding bill. Cruz did that very thing in 2013, when he was one of 16 senators to vote against cloture for the spending bill that would go on to end the shutdown. He was also one of 18 senators to vote against the bill itself.",0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,false

Final Rating: False",Global warming is part of (a) natural cycle and theres nothing we can actually do to stop these cycles.,"During the U.Ns global summit on climate change in Scotland, Facebook users shared a viral image claiming that global warming occurs naturally, and that humans are not part of the cause. The image contains a photo of a man and this quote, attributed to Dr. David Bellamy: Global warming is part of (a) natural cycle and theres nothing we can actually do to stop these cycles. The world is now facing spending a vast amount of money in tax to try to solve a problem that doesnt actually exist. The posts, including one by a Facebook page named Climate Change is Crap, were flagged as part of Facebooks efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The photo is of Bellamy, an English botanist who died in 2019. The scientist and onetime TV broadcaster uttered the quote in a 2008 interview, where he reiterated his opinion that warming is not man made. The current scientific consensus is that humans do cause climate change. It dates back at least to when PolitiFact began fact-checking such claims in 2007, when we found that the overwhelming consensus among climate scientists was that humans are the main cause of global warming. In a landmark report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change released Aug. 9, 234 authors relying on more than 14,000 studies said it is unequivocal that human influence has warmed the atmosphere, ocean and land. The report said that it has high confidence that the main driver of increased frequency and intensity of hot extremes experienced over most land regions since the 1950s is human-induced climate change. It is also likely, the report said, that human influence has resulted in a greater frequency of concurrent heatwaves and droughts on the global scale, fires in some regions and compound flooding in some places. NASA explains the consensus around human contributions to climate change this way: Multiple studies published in peer-reviewed scientific journals show that human activities are the primary cause of the observed climate-warming trend over the past century, and multiple studies show that 97% or more of actively publishing climate scientists agree: Climate-warming trends over the past century are extremely likely due to human activities. NASA explains that the Earths climate has changed throughout history and, over 800,000 years, most of those changes are due to small variations in the Earths orbit, which affects how much solar energy the planet receives. But todays trends are not a result of just variations to Earths orbit. NASA says theres a greater than 95% probability that most of the current warming trend is the result of human activity since the mid-20th century. Increased levels of so-called greenhouse gases, like carbon dioxide, cause the Earth to warm by blocking heat from escaping the atmosphere and radiating it back toward the Earths surface. Carbon dioxide can be released through, say, volcanic eruptions, but humans have also increased the concentration of atmospheric carbon dioxide by 47% since the Industrial Revolution started. Methane can likewise be produced through both natural sources and human activities, such as agriculture and livestock manure management. Human activities are changing the natural greenhouse, NASA says. Over the last century the burning of fossil fuels like coal and oil has increased the concentration of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2). This happens because the coal or oil burning process combines carbon with oxygen in the air to make CO2. To a lesser extent, the clearing of land for agriculture, industry and other human activities has increased concentrations of greenhouse gases. A viral image claims: Global warming is part of (a) natural cycle and theres nothing we can actually do to stop these cycles. The quote is from an English botanist from 2008. It does not reflect the current scientific consensus, which is that human activity does contribute to global warming.",0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,false

Final Rating: False  ","Gas costs $7.89 at a station in Albuquerque, New Mexico.","An image of a sign advertising gas prices alongside a row of pumps on a clear, sunny day shows a startling figure: $7.89 a gallon for unleaded gas. Text over the image identifies the Maverik gas stations location as Albuquerque, N.M., on March 19. Awful, one of many people sharing the image on social media wrote before blaming President Joe Biden. Thanks Sleepy Jo. This post was flagged as part of Facebooks efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Gas prices have mostly been going up nationwide since they bottomed out at around $1.87 in late April 2020, as the economic recovery fuels more demand. The average retail price for all grades was $2.95 a gallon for the week ended March 22, according to federal data, up from about $2.47 when Biden took office. But $7.89 for regular grade would be way out of range. We searched online for Maverik gas Albuquerque and started to call each of the nine locations listed to get an explanation. Tiffany Garcia, a cashier at the first store, told us that she had already talked to a customer that day asking whether the gas was $7.89. Thats wrong, she said. The price of unleaded gas at the station was $2.78 a gallon March 19, and it was still that price when PolitiFact called on March 22. John Silva, a maintenance worker at the second store listed on Google Maps, told us the price of regular unleaded gas there was $2.77. He didnt know anything about prices surging to $7.89, he said. Our next call solved the mystery. Joanna Archuleta, a cashier at the third Maverikstore, knew exactly what we were talking about. The picture is real, she said, but the sign is at a Maverik store that hasnt opened yet. When it does open and customers are able to buy gas there, it will reflect the correct price. At her store, thats $2.78 a gallon for regular unleaded. This tracks with what we found on a website listing gas prices in Albuquerque shared on the website of the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy at the U.S. Energy Department. On March 22, regular unleaded gas in the city cost as little as $2.30 and as much as $2.89, according to Albuquerque Gas Prices. Diesel was a little more expensive: as much as $3.19. But we saw nothing close to the prices that appear in the image. The image is being used to claim that Biden has caused gas prices to surge to nearly $8 a gallon in New Mexico. That hasnt happened.",0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,false

Final Rating: False","Says a powder has been developed that, when mixed with water, is being used in Germany as a mist. Health care workers go through a misting tent going into the hospital and it kills the coronavirus completely dead not only right then, but any time in the next 14 days that the virus touches anything thats been sprayed, it is killed.","During a live interview on a local television station in East Texas, U.S. Rep. Louie Gohmert discussed the coronavirus and measures he says some health care workers around the world are taking to stay safe while treating patients who have tested positive for the virus. Gohmert, a Republican from Tyler, said he recently spoke with an Arizona-based company that is producing a powder that, when mixed with water, can kill the coronavirus on contact. He said the same product, or one like it, is already in use in Germany, and he is trying to get the Arizona-based product fast-tracked in the United States. It is being used in Germany as a mist, he said. Health care workers go through a misting tent going into the hospital and it kills the coronavirus completely dead not only right then, but any time in the next 14 days that the virus touches anything thats been sprayed it is killed. The problem with Gohmerts statement? No such product exists and nothing similar is in use in Germany. What your congressman said is absolute nonsense, said Dr. Jörn Wegner, a spokesman for Deutsche Krankenhausgesellschaft, or the German Hospital Association. There are no such tents and theres no powder or magical cure. Gohmerts office did not return a request for more information about his statement, including what substance constitutes this powder and the name of the company in Arizona that he says is working on such a product. It is possible Gohmert was thinking of recent news reports of sterilization stations in use in China — images show individuals being sprayed with mist as they walk through a tunnel — but experts said the bleach-type sprays being used at these stations are likely not effective against the coronavirus. Protective measures in Germany A search of top news publications in Germany and the United States revealed no recent articles published about a powder or disinfectant being used on hospital employees that kills the virus on contact and for 14 days after the fact. While Germany has been hit hard by the coronavirus, it is also among the countries with the lowest fatality rate. News outlets have explored why Germany has reported such a low fatality rate, including analyzing how its hospitals are handling the outbreak. But those reports have not mentioned a substance like the one Gohmert described. In Germany, health authorities at the state level are responsible for hospital planning and operation while the Federal Ministry of Health drafts overarching policies and regulations. Sebastian Gülde, spokesman for the Bundesministerium für Gesundheit, or Federal Ministry of Health, said he is aware of some hospitals that are using tents for screening for symptoms of the virus, but he did not have knowledge of a product like the one Gohmert described. I did not hear of a disinfecting agent that keeps pathogens away for two weeks, Gülde said. Gülde directed PolitiFacts inquiry to the Deutsche Gesellschaft für Krankenhaushygiene, the German Society of Hospital Hygiene, which issues recommendations on best practices for hospital hygiene and health. Thomas Ruttkowski, the organizations spokesman, said there is no product like the one Gohmert described. Im sorry, but we did not heard about that magic powder, he said in an email. Thank you for your mail.  Finally, something to laugh about. Protecting against the virus During the interview, Gohmert mentioned that a company in Arizona was developing a similar product, but his team did not return a request for more information about the company or its product. A thorough web search did not return results for news stories or company websites for a business that may be working on producing this kind of powder-like product that can kill the coronavirus on contact. Currently, no disinfectant of this nature has been highlighted by the Environmental Protective Agency as being effective for use against SARS-CoV-2 (the coronavirus that causes COVID-19). None of these products registered with the EPA are approved for use on people. They are strictly surface disinfectants. Amy Cross, project coordinator at the National Pesticide Information Center, said she is not aware of a product on the list of EPA-regulated surface disinfectants that meets the description Gohmert offered. There are some products that are powder-based and can be combined with water and used in a liquid form, Cross said. But like all of the disinfectants on the list, the product is a liquid and has a set contact time — the amount of time a surface needs to stay wet with a product for it to be effective. Cross said this time varies by product, ranging from 15 seconds to 15 minutes. The idea that it would have residual activity after the surface is no longer wet to kill that virus is incredibly surprising to me, because I havent found any other products that have those similar claims, she said of the powder Gohmert described. When reached for comment, a World Health Organization spokesperson pointed to the groups guidelines for infection prevention and control geared towards health care workers treating individuals who are likely infected with the coronavirus. The guidelines do not make mention of a disinfectant like the one Gohmert mentioned. They emphasize the need for workers to use personal protective equipment when necessary and practice rigorous hand hygiene. The WHO guidelines also emphasize the importance of environmental cleaning and disinfection procedures and state that washing surfaces with water and detergent and applying commonly used hospital-level disinfectants (such as sodium hypochlorite) are effective and sufficient procedures. Wegner of the German Hospital Association echoed these recommendations. The only protection against the virus are personal protection equipment – masks, disposable coats and gloves – and proper hygiene, he said. Our ruling Gohmert said that there is a powder substance that, when mixed with water, is being used as a disinfecting mist in Germany. Health care workers go through a misting tent going into the hospital and it kills the coronavirus completely dead not only right then, but any time in the next 14 days that the virus touches anything thats been sprayed it is killed, he said. But no such product seems to exist and no similar product is in use in Germany. There are no products currently in use as disinfecting agents in the United States that come close to meeting the description Gohmert offered. Gohmert did not return a request seeking more information about his statement.",0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,false

Final Rating: False  ",Ted Cruz is in negotiations to be Donald Trumps running mate.,"We spotted this headline below a post on the Dallas Morning News Trailblazers political news blog: Breaking: Cruz Negotiating With Trump for VP Spot. Of course, that would be Texas Sen. Ted Cruz negotiating with Republican presidential frontrunner Donald Trump to serve as Trumps November 2016 running mate. Huge! But wait--wheres the breathless CNN report, the insiders analysis on Fox News or even the basic newspaper scoop? We found nothing of the sort in online searches or in the Nexis news database and when we asked Cruzs campaign about the Feb. 25, 2016, Elect Leaders post, spokesman Brian Phillips replied by email: Is this a serious request? Well, the Cruz-negotiating-with-Trump item, also posted on ElectLeaders.com, which describes itself as keeping watch on our leaders and wannabe leaders, has a little traction. When we saw the headline March 21, 2016, the post had been shared on Facebook more than 34,000 times. Historical precedent And history shows a joint ticket could play out. In 2008, Barack Obama chose to run with a failed presidential hopeful, Joe Biden. In 1980, Ronald Reagan reached out to the defeated George H.W. Bush. Twenty years before, Democrat John F. Kennedy picked Texan Lyndon B. Johnson. So Trump-Cruz, pairing the frontrunner with the fellow running second, is possible. On the other hand, Phillips followed up with an email calling the post categorically false. Anonymous sourcing For our part, we noticed a red flag in that the Elect Leaders item doesnt quote named sources, not even a campaign spokeswomanoffering a no comment. Heres what the post says: A high ranking Cruz campaign official has told Elect Leaders that Sen. Cruz is in negotiations with Mr. Trump to become his Vice Presidential Nominee after Rubio dropped out Tuesday. Thats confusing timewise in that Sen. Marco Rubio dropped his presidential bid Tuesday March 15, 2016, after falling short of victory in his home state of Florida. The item goes on to say Cruz has been the most consistent performer in primaries behind Trump. They are seeing the writing on the wall and want to negotiate from a point of strength which will evaporate over time. The official, again unnamed, stated Mr. Trump is interested in using Sen. Cruzs ground game in the general election, likes his appeal to the conservative base and his stance on immigration. Of the other options for VP none hold as strong of an opinion on immigration outside of Gov. Jan Brewer from Arizona who is also being considered.Brewer, by the way, is no longer governor. Finally, the post says, Cruz, the former solicitor general of Texas, has an eye on shifting from vice president to the Supreme Court. Cruz, the item says, in exchange for his support is wanting to be named to the Supreme Court if an opening occurs while Mr. Trump is president. Mr. Trump does not see this as an issue and a small price to pay to bring Sen. Cruz his fundraisers, donors and staff on board, the post says. We tried to reach out to Elect Leaders about the post and didnt hear back. Otherwise, we found no indication Trump-Cruz negotiations were (or are) afoot. A Trump maybe, Cruz'szero interest In November 2015 -- eons ago in politicking time maybe especially given Trumps references to Cruz as LyinTed-- Trump told conservative talk-show host Laura Ingraham that Cruz might be his choice for the No. 2 slot. To be fair, Trumpdeclined to name a potential running matefrom among his GOP opponents before noting his affection for Cruz. Well, I like like him, Trump said at the time. Hes backed everything Ive said  Ted Cruz is now agreeing with me 100 percent. But Trump also didnt go further down the veep path, saying: I like to think of victory, Ive had a lot of victories, and I like to do victories first, then start thinking about other things. Cruz, meantime, said March 15, 2016 that he wasnt inclined to join Trump on a single ticket, if offered the vice presidency. Conservative talk-show host Hugh Hewittasked if Cruz would ever agree to serve as Trumps vice president? I have absolutely zero interest in doing that, Cruz replied, going on to say he expected to overtake Trump and win the delegates needed to secure the presidential nomination. And on March 21, 2016, just before we completed this fact check, Cruz told CNNs Wolf Blitzer: I have zero interest whatsoever in being Trumps running mate. Blitzer had asked Cruz about the possibility by noting Trump earlier responded to Blitzers question about choosing Cruz as his running mate by saying: Crazier things happen in politics. Our ruling On Facebook, Elect Leaders said Cruz and Trump are negotiating a Trump-Cruz Republican ticket. Anything is possible. But we don't see evidence the two camps are latelyplotting a shared ticket. FALSE – The statement is not accurate.

Final Rating: False  ",Our children do not spend any time in school learning about our own U.S. Constitution.,"In a recent column criticizing the Mansfield school districts plans to introduce an Arabic program to its schools, state Rep. Dan Flynn, R-Canton, wondered why Arabic culture is a priority at a time when our children do not spend any time in school learning our own U.S. Constitution.We wondered whether Texas students spend no time studying the Constitution, as Flynn says in the opinion piece published Feb. 14 on the North Texas Navigator news website.When we contacted the representatives office, Flynns chief of staff, David Erinakes told us there is no dedicated class on the U.S. Constitution as early as first grade, and (Flynns) implication is that he believes all Texas school children should have a class on the U.S. Constitution while theyre in school at least one time.Erinakes said that while the Constitution is written into the states curriculum standards for the public schools, there isnt very much time spent on it. Erinakes said Flynn based this conclusion on conversations with teachers who have recently visited the representatives office.We turned next to the Texas Essential Knowledge and Skills for social studies, curriculum standards outlining what students must be taught in Texas classrooms. In an online post of the standards now in place — an update takes effect in 2011-12 — we spotted about 35 references to teaching students about the constitution.According to the standards, students are introduced to the U.S. Constitution in fifth grade when they must identify the important ideas in the Declaration of Independence and the U.S. Constitution and examine fundamental rights guaranteed in the Bill of Rights. Seventh graders should be able to explain the influence of the U.S. Constitution on the Texas Constitution. Eighth graders are supposed to study the creation and ratification of the U.S. Constitution.History and government comes under the heading of social studies until high school, when specific courses in those subjects are offered. In a course in U.S. history since the Reconstruction, students are expected to identify and analyze methods on expanding the right to participate in the Democratic process, including... amendments to the U.S. Constitution. A significant focus of the states mandatory high school U.S. government class is on the U.S. Constitution, its underlying principles and ideas and the form of government it created.Next we looked at online versions of the Texas Assessment of Knowledge and Skills tests annually administered to students from grades 3 to 11. Fifth- and eighth-graders must pass the reading and math tests, and 11th-grade students must pass all portions of test, which include social studies, to graduate.Searching for constitution in the social-studies portion of the 2009 test for eighth-graders, we found four references, including one question asking students to identify how the 13th Amendment changed the Constitution (B. Abolished slavery).We found five references to the Constitution in the tenth-grade test, including a question about what principle the Constitutions establishment of the executive, legislative and judicial branches reflects.And in 11th grade? Two references to the U.S. Constitution.Debbie Ratcliffe, an education agency spokeswoman, told us that local educators determine how much time is spent on the Constitution, but she pointed out that each grade is required to observe Celebrate Freedom Week, which falls on the week of Constitution Day — Sept. 17. The standards going into effect in 2011-12 reflect the observance. According to the pending standards, third through eighth grade classes, for example, must include appropriate instruction concerning the intent, meaning and importance of the Declaration of Independence and the U.S. Constitution during Celebrate Freedom Week, or during another full school week as determined by each school districts board of trustees.Andy Welch, a spokesman for the Austin school district, told us that Austin teachers teach what the state standards require.Richie Escovedo, a Mansfield district spokesman, told us: We definitely do teach the Constitution. He pointed us to the districts curriculum specifying that students study the Constitution in fifth, seventh and 12th grade. Also, Escovedo noted, district third-graders study questions such as, Why was a new Constitution needed after the American Revolution? and How does the Bill of Rights protect you, even as a child?When we told Flynn that we couldnt find evidence to support his claim, Erinakes responded: You are correct that it is in the standards, but as to the time spent it seems to be minimal at best... Relative to the amount of time spent on other subjects, our children do not spend any time at all learning about the U.S. Constitution.Flynns statement, though, was absolute. Lacking back-up information from his end or any other evidence that either schools are flouting the states curriculum standards or students arent being held to them, the statement more than fails.

Posts on Facebook take the vacation claim further, and suggest that all Democrats are on vacation until May 4 and refuse to come back to sign a bill to replenish the program. This is misleading. All of Congress, which includes House and Senate Republicans, are in recess to avoid spreading the coronavirus. The post was flagged as part of Facebooks efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Congress announced it would extend its recess until May 4 to continue practicing social distancing and avoid transmitting the coronavirus. As the country continues working together to flatten the curve, following the advice of health experts, the full Senate is not expected to travel back to Washington D.C. sooner than Monday, May 4th, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said in a statement on April 14. All members will receive at least 24 hours notice if this changes. This bipartisan decision reflects consultation with Leader Schumer and my colleagues in Senate leadership. House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer made a similar announcement April 13, saying that absent an emergency, the House is not expected to meet prior to Monday, May 4, 2020. Senate leaders announced on April 21 that the two parties reached a deal for another relief package. The legislation could be approved by unanimous consent, which does not require a majority of members to be present. But Democrats have not refused to come back from vacation. Both the Senate and the House are in recess until May 4 to avoid spreading the coronavirus. The decision was made by congressional leadership.
