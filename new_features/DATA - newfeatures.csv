Final Rating: False  ",The boilermakers union has endorsed me because I sat down with them and went into great detail with leadership [about] exactly what I would do.,"When asked to prove his support for fracking is genuine, Joe Biden said last week that hed won the backing of the boilermakers, a union whose members depend on the natural gas industry and passionately support the controversial drilling technique. The boilermakers union has endorsed me because I sat down with them and went into great detail with leadership [about] exactly what I would do, Biden said Thursday in Philadelphia during a nationally televised ABC News town hall. Thats not true. Biden hasnt been endorsed by the International Brotherhood of Boilermakers — which represents 50,000 people across the country who work in heavy industry, manufacturing, and related sectors — or Local 154, the Pittsburgh-area chapter mentioned at the event. The international union states clearly on its website that it hasnt endorsed a candidate for president this cycle. The International Brotherhood of Boilermakers has not endorsed any U.S. Presidential candidate for the 2020 Election, and the information contained on this webpage in no way serves as an endorsement by the International Brotherhood of Boilermakers for any U.S. Presidential candidate. A note on the website continues: As a union boilermaker, your vote is a personal decision. You have the right to vote for candidates and issues as you so choose. Your vote can make a difference in electing the representatives and policymakers who support labor issues and advocate for the work boilermakers do. Local union lodges arent bound by what the larger umbrella group does, and in September, Local 154 endorsed President Donald Trump. The other day I'm watching the debate and I see Joe Biden tell everybody that the boilermakers endorsed him and that is not true, said John Hughes, Local 154s business manager. He said he talked to somebody. I'd like to know who he talked to in the boilermakers because anybody I talk to did not endorse him. Asked for evidence that Biden spoke with members of the boilermakers union, Andrew Bates, the Biden campaigns director of rapid response, provided none. Instead he listed several other Pennsylvania unions Biden met with and won endorsements from while campaigning, such as Teamsters Local 249, United Association of Plumbers Local 27, and Pennsylvania AFL-CIO. Bates added that the boilermakers endorsed Joe Biden twice. Hes talking about the 2008 and 2012 election cycles, when the union endorsed President Barack Obama, and Joe Biden was his running mate. But an Obama endorsement doesnt automatically count as a Biden nod. The Democratic nominating contest was still in full swing in February 2008 when the boilermakers union threw its support behind Obama. Not only had Obama not yet named Biden as his running mate, but Biden was still seeking the nomination himself and had been passed over for the endorsement. The endorsement the boilermakers made in 2012 when Obama was running for reelection could more plausibly be described as support for an Obama-Biden ticket. The boilermakers union came up at the town hall when Pittsburgh resident Michele Ellison asked Biden to describe his vision for the energy sector in Southwestern Pennsylvania, where fracking has lifted the economy and employed plenty of boilermakers but also sickened some residents who live near the wells that extract natural gas from miles beneath the Earths surface. Before answering the question, Biden emphasized, as he has said repeatedly, that he does not want to ban fracking. He wants to block the federal government from issuing new permits for drilling on public land but would otherwise allow existing fracking operations to continue, with environmental safeguards in place. He went on to say that he wants to invest in renewable energy and the battery technology needed to store it. Biden said the boilermakers union has endorsed me. There are several things wrong with this statement. First, the International Brotherhood of Boilermakers hasnt endorsed a candidate for president this cycle. Second, Local 154, the Pittsburgh area chapter mentioned during the town hall, endorsed Trump. Third, the boilermakers did not endorse Biden twice in the past as his campaign said. And fourth, the Biden campaign provided no evidence that he sat down with the unions leaders as he said. Bidens statement is not accurate.",0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,False

Final Rating: False  ",A horrible law requires that children be separated from their parents once they cross the Border into the U.S.,"President Donald Trump wrongly blamed Democrats for his own administrators immigration policy. Put pressure on the Democrats to end the horrible law that separates children from there (sic) parents once they cross the Border into the U.S., Trump tweeted. Trump recently told Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen, I know what you're going through right now with families is very tough, but those are the bad laws that the Democrats gave us. We have to break up families. But there is no law that mandates separating children from their parents. Trumps own administration devised a policy to that effect. So what is Trump talking about? Whenever parents are charged with a federal misdemeanor (entry without inspection in this case), or awaiting trial, they are placed in the custody of the U.S. Marshals Service. Children cannot go to jail, so they are transferred to the custody of Health and Human Services Office of Refugee Resettlement. They are then placed with relatives, juvenile detention centers or foster care. Thats a longstanding Homeland Security policy, DHS told us. Before the Trump administration, immigrants entering illegally as families were rarely prosecuted, said Sarah Pierce, an associate policy analyst of the U.S. Immigration Program at the Migration Policy Institute. Instead, immigrants were held in family detention centers until they were sent to appear before an immigration court or deported. Attorney General Jeff Sessionsannounced on April 6 the Homeland Security Department would now be referring all illegal border crossings to the Justice Department for prosecution. Facing criminal charges, parents would go to detention centers, leaving their children unaccompanied. Its the decision to prosecute parents that is causing the separations. Thats a choice they have made thats largely different from what other administrations have done, said Peter Margulies, an immigration law and national security law professor at Roger Williams University School of Law. When we asked for evidence of policies separating families, the White House referred us to items determining what happens to unaccompanied immigrant minors. But none of the children in question would be deemed unaccompanied if the Trump administration did not decide to prosecute their parents. The 1997 Flores Settlement Agreement, for example, calls for the release of unaccompanied minors to family members or sponsors who can care for them as their immigration case is resolved. The Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of 2008, which Trump has wrongly called a Democrat rule, determines that unaccompanied minors be transferred to Health and Human Servicescustody. The White House argued such policies encourage parents to send their children into the United States, knowing they will be promptly released. The cruel and inhumane open borders policies of the Democratic Party are responsible for encouraging mass illegal migration, enabling horrendous child smuggling, and releasing violent MS-13 gang members into American communities, White House deputy press secretary Hogan Gidley said in an emailed statement. The Trump administration may believe that Democrats are responsible for policies that encourage illegal border crossing, but we found no law mandating that children be separated from their parents. Trump said a horrible law requires that children be separated from their parents once they cross the Border into the U.S. There is no such law. The Homeland Security Departments longstanding policy is to separate children from their custodians when they are referred for criminal prosecution. Trumps administration has decided to prosecute all illegal crossings. Families were rarely prosecuted under previous administrations.",0,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,False

Final Rating: False  ",President Obama gave Egypt's Muslim Brotherhood one and a half billion dollars.,"Foreign policy was one of the issues that came up when U.S. Senate candidate Benjamin Barry Hinckley was interviewed on State of the State, a cable television public affairs program that aired April 21 and 22.Hinckley, a Republican, was critical of foreign aid, and specifically questioned one of the aid decisions of the Obama administration. He was struggling a bit as he made his point, but here's what he said:Obama gave the Muslim Brotherhood a million [then correcting himself] a billion and a half dollars last week, you know, in Egypt. We need that money here. A billion and a half dollars could really help Rhode Island, quite frankly. We probably need it, in my opinion, more than the Muslim Brotherhood needs it . . . especially when the Muslim Brotherhood got together, I think one of the first things they did, when they convened their new congress, was to make Israel enemy #1. And we give them a billion and a half dollars? That's a problem in my book. We need to focus our resources here.The Muslim Brotherhood has been a part of Egyptian politics -- sometimes an outlawed part -- since 1928; one of its goals is to promote Sharia law, which is the moral code and religious law of Islam.Did the Obama administration really give the Brotherhood $1.5 billion?It turns out that the money was actually an aid package to Egypt itself, not the Brotherhood, according to a March 22 story in The Washington Post.We contacted Hinckley's campaign.Spokesman Christopher McAuliffe said Hinckley is aware that there is a pro forma difference between the Muslim Brotherhood and the government of Egypt. In that light, his position could certainly have been more precise. However, I do think the basis of it is readily understandable, since the Egyptian government is dominated by the Muslim Brotherhood.For guidance on that point, we contacted some experts on Egypt.Melani Cammett, director of the Middle East studies program at Brown University, told us that sending aid to Egypt was not the same as giving it to the Brotherhood because the Brotherhood doesn't actually control the government.It's true that the Muslim Brotherhood won the plurality of seats [in December elections] and when you combine them with the Salafis, which are more radical Islamists, they've won the majority of seats in the parliament, she said. The fact of the matter is the SCAF, which is the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces, still controls the government and controls the executive branch and is manipulating things in such a way that it's making it difficult for the Islamists to exert their full power as the majority in parliament.So the major struggle going on in Egyptian politics right now is that the SCAF, controlled by elite military officers, is not willing to relinquish power, said Cammett.John P. Entelis, director of Middle East studies at Fordham University, said it would be totally inaccurate to say that $1.5 billion is going to the Muslim Brotherhood. This is an ongoing military aid package that we've been giving to Egypt since 1979.The aid package, according to multiple sources, includes $1.3 billion in military aid and $250 million in economic and political assistance.Our rulingRepublican U.S. Senate candidate Barry Hinckley said the Obama administration approved $1.5 billion to go to Egypt's Muslim Brotherhood.In fact, the aid package was for the nation of Egypt, not the Brotherhood. The Brotherhood may control the largest bloc of seats in parliament, but it's not even a majority. Not only that, the country itself continues, for now at least, to be controlled by the military. And more than 80 percent of the aid package is military aid.(Get updates from PolitiFactRI on Twitter.

Final Rating: False  ",Kobe Bryants untimely death has been planned for a while.,"Former NBA player Kobe Bryant, his 13-year-old daughter and seven other people were killed on Jan. 26 when the helicopter they were riding in crashed in Calabasas, Calif. Online, some people are claiming that the crash wasnt an accident. We already debunked one Facebook post that suggested Bryant was murdered. Now, were looking at an Instagram post that claims Bryants death was planned. After LeBron James passes Kobe on the all time NBA scoring list, Kobes personal helicopter crashes only a day later, the Jan. 26 post says. LeBron has to hit the 33,644 point mark to pass Kobe Bryant & become the NBAs 3rd highest scorer in history. The 33 is significant. The 6 is significant. And Ive been speaking on the importance of the 44 ritual in pro sports for months now. To me, this looks like a ritual sacrifice in order for the LA Lakers to win their 17th championship, & for LeBron to get his 4th ring. I believe this was also a ritual sacrifice for the 49ers to win the Superbowl. It goes on about the significance of other numbers, like Bryants birthday, before concluding: This definitely makes me believe that his untimely death has been planned for a while now. This post was flagged as part of Facebooks efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) On Jan. 25, Los Angeles Laker LeBron James passed Bryants all-time scoring record. Playing against the Philadelphia 76ers that day, James finished with 29 points, bringing his career total to 33,655, according to the Washington Post. Bryant finished his career with 33,643. Bryant tweeted his congratulations that night: Continuing to move the game forward @KingJames. Much respect my brother #33644. But theres no evidence to suggest that Bryant, a former Lakers star, was killed in a ritual sacrifice, as the Instagram post claims. Rather, Bryants plane crashed in fog dense enough that the Los Angeles Police Department grounded its helicopters. National Transportation Safety Board investigators arrived in California after the incident, and the agency is working with the Federal Aviation Administration, the helicopters manufacturer and the company that made its engine to collect evidence about the crash, according to the Post. The investigation will look at weather data, radar information air traffic control communications, maintenance logs and the pilots record.",0,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,False

Final Rating: Mostly False  ",Nurses submitting coronavirus tests say they all are coming back positive.,"What do Elon Musk and the winner of Project Runway Season 3 have in common? Theyve both shared unproven claims about false-positive coronavirus test results. Since states started reopening in May, COVID-19 cases have increased in the United States. A June 27 post claims thats because the labs that process coronavirus tests are falsifying results. Its frightening how were being rail railroaded, reads the post, which is a screenshot of an Instagram post from Jeffrey Sebelia, the winner of the third season of Project Runway. My mom actually knows a nurse in San Francisco who was giving COVID tests. After every test came back positive she got suspicious. So she sent in two separate blank tests. Unused swabs. Those both came back positive. Sebelia said his mom and some co-workers used fake names to submit 10 unused swabs that all tested positive. What the hell is going on ???? reads the post, which we cannot access since Sebelias account is private. Its beyond greed and money for hospitals. We are being controlled and manipulated beyond anything we could ever imagine. The Facebook post was flagged as part of Facebooks efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Similar posts have been shared thousands of times, according to CrowdTangle, an audience metrics tool. (Screenshot from Facebook) We reached out to Sebelia for evidence to back up his post. He told us it was a word-of-mouth story from his mom. She doesnt lie but beyond that there is no proof, he said in an email. Sebelia is right —there is no proof to back up his claims. But over the past several weeks, many social media users — including Musk, the CEO of Tesla and SpaceX — have passed on secondhand stories about fraudulent COVID-19 tests or unproven claims about false-positives. So we wanted to look into the notion that labs are falsifying COVID-19 test results. Public health officials say that false-positive tests are rare; the real concern is false-negatives. While COVID-19 tests may sometimes produce false-positive results, there is no evidence that labs are deliberately manipulating samples. And public health officials are more concerned about false-negatives than false-positives. There are three main coronavirus tests: diagnostic, antibody and antigen. Diagnostic tests look for the genetic material of the coronavirus in a sample thats typically taken from a persons nose or throat. Health care providers and public health officials use them to confirm whether someone has the disease. Since diagnostic tests are considered the most common and reliable COVID-19 test, were going to focus on them. There are more than 100 diagnostic tests that have received emergency use authorization from the Food and Drug Administration. Many cities and health care providers use private firms like LabCorp and Quest Diagnostics to provide and process diagnostic coronavirus tests. We reached out to both companies for a comment, but we havent heard back. We could find no evidence that labs are deliberately altering coronavirus test results to create false-positives. RELATED: The international supply chain behind coronavirus testing The accuracy of a coronavirus diagnostic test depends on several factors, including the timing of the test and how it was stored. There have been several cases of tests producing the wrong results. In mid-May, the Food and Drug Administration issued a warning saying that a rapid-response test from Abbott Laboratories could produce false-negative results. Abbott advised health care providers not to store patient samples in solutions known as viral transport media. The company said the swabs should be placed directly into the device and then the test will work as expected. The accuracy of COVID-19 tests, particularly for people who are not experiencing symptoms, is still uncertain. But false-positive results appear to be an outlier. A LabCorp fact sheet for the companys diagnostic coronavirus test says there is a very small chance the test can give false-positive results. The instructions for a similar test from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention say that false test results are highly dependent on prevalence. False-negative test results are more likely when prevalence of disease is high, the document reads. False-positive test results are more likely when prevalence is moderate to low. In layman's terms: as coronavirus infections increase, so does the chance of false-negative results. So it stands to reason that, as the U.S. continues to see new COVID-19 cases rise, false-negative results are more common than false-positives. That fact can have worse unintended consequences than false-positive results. People who receive false-negative results may not seek treatment for COVID-19 symptoms and risk infecting more people. Sebelias post inspired a slew of copy-pasted hoaxes about COVID-19 testing. Many cite friends or family members, and they echo months-old conspiracy theories about the coronavirus pandemic. A June 30 Facebook post is very similar to Sebelias story. Nurses at a hospital doing covid testing became suspicious when all their tests were coming back positive, reads the post. They sent 2 tests with unused swabs and they came back positive. Nurses used fake names, sent 10 unused swabs to be tested and all came back positive. We are being played! The post is a screenshot of a now-deleted tweet from a user named Robert Tayman, whose account was created in February and regularly promotes conspiratorial content. He said in a follow-up tweet (also deleted) that the nurses are close personal friends that work at a major hospital in Baltimore, Maryland. (Screenshot from Twitter) The Baltimore Department of Health denied commenting for this story. Taymans tweet was deleted, but screenshots quickly made their way to Facebook, where they were shared thousands of times. The first few posts with Taymans tweet were published in conservative and anti-media groups on June 29, according to CrowdTangle. At first, users started off linking to the tweet, but soon users were posting screenshots of the post. Eventually, the text of the tweet was copied and shared with no context at all —similar to how chain emails work. Another Facebook post, published June 29, also recounts the story about nurses sending in 10 unused swabs that all came back positive. The post is a screenshot of an Instagram post and cites a sister whos a cardiac ICU nurse. The consensus was not that +cases dont exist, but that the numbers are exaggerated, reads text in the screenshot. In each iteration of the post, the one clear theme is that every test comes back positive. But that belies the actual numbers hospitals and health departments are reporting. According to data compiled by the COVID Tracking Project, the rate of positive coronavirus tests has never exceeded 21.9% (that was in early April). The positivity testing rate hit a low of 4.4% in mid-June. Currently, its around 7%. That means 93% of tests produce negative results. These recent posts were not created in a vacuum. Similar rumors have circulated recently in India and Turkey. And conspiracy theories that claim officials are falsifying coronavirus test results —or that the pandemic itself is fabricated —have been circulating online for months. In late March, a website called the Cabal Times wrote about a video from a Swedish YouTuber who goes by the name Zakleo Se Bumbar. The video spins an elaborate conspiracy theory that asserts false-positive COVID-19 tests are driving the bulk of new cases. The Facebook post claims that labs are manipulating coronavirus tests to create false-positive results. We could find no evidence to back that up. Sebelia, the source of the claim, said it was a word-of-mouth story from his mom without proof. Similarly inaccurate or unproven claims about coronavirus tests have been circulating for weeks, many of which echo months-old conspiracy theories about the pandemic. While COVID-19 tests may sometimes produce false-positive results, there is no evidence that labs are deliberately manipulating samples. Experts are more concerned about false-negatives, which could pose health consequences. The Facebook post is inaccurate.",0,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,Mostly False

Final Rating: True  ",The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office received zero complaints about the Washington Redskins name.,"Theres new hysteria surrounding the cancellation of the Washington Redskins trademark registration, and it goes like this: The governments decision was much ado about nothing. After reading our fact-check about the Obama administrations (lack of) direct involvement in the decision, a reader asked us to look into a claim from a conservative blog that the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office canceled the teams trademark without public outcry to do so. One would think that the public outcry against such an offensive, inflammatory name mustve been huge to gain the attention of a senator. People must have been writing tons of letters complaining about how racist the name was in order to get President Obama to weigh in on the issue. The number of complaints the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office received about the Redskins name was astounding, but not because there were so many. In fact, its quite the opposite. The agency received zero complaints about the teams name. Zero. The post by the Conservative Tribune deems this evidence of a left-wing scheme to win voters and open the door for repealing the First Amendment. We checked it out and did not exactly find a scandal. Most notably, the post fails to mention why the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office considered canceling the trademarks in the first place: People complained about it. The Conservative Tribune blog post links to a story at Weasel Zippers, which links back to a story that first appeared in the conservative Washington Times newspaper. On June 18, 2014, a panel of three administrative law judges known as the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board canceled the teams trademark registrations on the grounds that it disparages American Indians. As expected, the team is appealing the decision, just as it did when it challenged the same panels decision in 1999 in a related complaint and won. (The football team can keep the rights to its trademark as it goes through the appeals process.) Two weeks after the decision, the Washington Times ran a story about how the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office could not produce any records that showed members of the public wrote in to express their opinions about the teams name before the most recent ruling. The newspapers public records request for correspondence about the logo turned up 13 pages of records, half of which came from a Texas man who wrote a meandering letter by hand after the ruling. The other pages came from a person congratulating the appeals board and from staffers seeking background information about the case for Delegate Eleanor Holmes Norton, the nonvoting member of Congress from Washington, D.C. (and an opponent of the teams name). Is it the bombshell as described by the Conservative Tribune website? Not really. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office does not solicit public comment like other government agencies as they consider new rules and regulations. Its not built that way. Its process prescribed by the U.S. Code works similar to a legal trial, in which only the parties involved can submit evidence. There could be one letter or 1,000, but its not going to make a difference in whether a trademark is granted or canceled. Put another way, its not part of the process in the way that the Environmental Protection Agency or Federal Trade Commission reviews public input before considering a new rule or regulation. In this case, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office acts more like the Supreme Court, in that the court wouldnt solicit or consider your opinion of the health care law before it issued a ruling. The presence or absence of letters of complaint in a case like this really does not have any bearing on whether or not a trademark is going to be canceled, said Elizabeth Rowe,University of Florida College of Law professor and director of the Program in Intellectual Property Law. If you want a trademark to be canceled, you have to do what the plaintiffs did here. The Redskins case deals with existing trademark registrations, which require investment on the part of people who seek to have the trademark canceled under federal code. In this case, five young people with American Indian heritage petitioned the Patent and Trademark Office in 2006 to cancel the registrations, arguing that it is disparaging. There is a brief period to allow for opposition to pending trademark applications, but a simple letter of complaint would not do much there either, Rowe said. That window is usually used by rival companies to assert whether a logo is too close to their own and confusing for consumers, and objections involve filing an objection, evidence to support it and having a hearing. Its really neither here nor there to say that they were letters of complaint or how many were there, Rowe said. The Washington Times article that called the missing public comment into question even echoes these points, quoting the plaintiffs attorney and a Georgetown University professor as saying public correspondence isnt built into the process for hearing individual cases. For what it's worth, there are petitionsat websites likeChange.organd MoveOn.orgin favor of changing the name or ditching it, and some have thousands of signatures. But theaim is to rally people about the issue and exert pressure on team ownership, not to influence the decisions of administrative law judges. Our ruling Conservative blog posts smell a scandal in the cancellation of the Washington Redskins trademark, pointing out that the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office received zero complaints about it before an administrative law court ruled in June. The case was opened because someone complained -- so that assertion is wrong on its face. But even that aside, the post is misleading in suggesting that public comments are part of the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office process when they are not. When people have a problem with patents and trademarks and want them removed, they file formal complaints, prove their standing in the case, pay a fee, and provide evidence to support their case. In other words, they do exactly what the five plaintiffs in this case did here.",1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,True

Final Rating: False  ",SaysGeorgia becomes first state to ban Muslim culture in historic move to restore Western values.,"A post that appears to have originated from fake news purveyors in Macedonia used a real news item from months ago to falsely say the U.S. state of Georgia has outlawed Muslim culture. A March 13, 2017, post on USANewsPost.us carried the headline, Georgia becomes first state to ban Muslim culture in historic move to restore Western values.  Facebook users flagged the post as potentially being fake, as part of the social media giants efforts to remove fake news from news feeds. PolitiFact Georgia examined the origins of this claim as part of the inauguralInternational Fact-Checking Day, April 2, 2017. Organizers at Poynter.orgdescribe the day as not a single event but a rallying cry for more facts - and fact-checking - in politics, journalism, and everyday life. The story cited an actual event — a Peach State lawmaker had introduced a bill in November 2016 in the Georgia General Assembly that would have banned the wearing of burqas, niqabs and veils. The story trumpeted the bill as being about keeping the American people safe. But the post did not indicate that the legislation never became law. State Rep. Jason Spencer on Nov. 15 filed HB 3 for the 2017 legislative session. The bill aimed to expand the scope of a state law passed in 1951 that made wearing a mask a misdemeanor (unless it was for celebrations, work, sports or emergencies). The original law aimed to prevent Ku Klux Klan members from wearing their hoods. Spencers bill could have prevented Muslim women from wearing any kind of head covering while driving, or possibly even while on public property. It also prevented people from wearing veils in drivers licenses and government-issued IDs, a rule the state already had. This bill is simply a response to constituents that do have concerns of the rise of Islamic terrorism, and we in the State of Georgia do not want our laws used against us, Spencer told Atlantas WSB-TV. The quote is cited in the USANewsPost.us article, which made an inference that if the bill passed, Georgia would have stopped Muslim culture in a way no other state had. (For the most part, the wearing of religious headcoverings is protected by the First Amendment.) But the bill didnt pass the General Assembly, because Spencer withdrew the measure just two days later. After further consideration, I have decided to not pursue HB 3 in the upcoming 2017 legislative session due to the visceral reaction it has created, he said in a statement. While this bill does not contain language that specifically targets any group, I am mindful of the perception that it has created. My objective was to address radical elements that could pose a threat to public safety. However, further consideration dictates that other solutions will need to be considered. In conclusion, anti-masking statutes have been upheld as constitutional (State vs Miller, 1990), and HB 3 would withstand legal scrutiny, but not political scrutiny. The Miller case to which Spencer refers involved a Klan member who challenged the Anti-Mask Act and lost. USANewsPost.us cites DailyUSAUpdate.com as the source of the post, and that site in turn says the post came from OpenMagazines.com. The story also has been shared on Facebook, across several other websites, tens of thousands of times. We contacted OpenMagazines.com via email to ask them about the misleading headline but didnt hear back. BuzzFeed has previously reported that both OpenMagazines.com and DailyUSAUpdate.com are registered to owners in Macedonia. The former Yugoslav republic became a hotbed of fake news during last years presidential election. Buzzfeed found that teenagers in the town of Veles operated at least 140 websites that published fake political news in the United States to draw in advertising dollars. USANewsPost.us also is registered to an administrator and address in Veles. Our ruling Bloggers said in a headline, Georgia becomes first state to ban Muslim culture in historic move to restore Western values. The post misrepresents the outcome of a months-old and short-lived legislative proposal from November 2016 that could have prevented Muslim women from hearing veils and headscarves. Muslim culture was not banned, although it did appear to briefly be under attack.",0,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,False

Final Rating: Mostly False  ","Says Hillary Clinton was let off the hook for her email scandal while Gen. David Petraeus had his life destroyed for doing far, far less.","Donald Trump has declared repeatedly that Hillary Clinton should be imprisoned over her email. Emails on her unsecured personal email server were found to have contained classified information despite her repeated insistence that all the material was unclassified. His evidence: other public officials, including David Petraeus, a former CIA director and a leading general in Iraq and Afghanistan, have been punished for far less. During a West Palm Beach, Fla., rally Oct. 13, Trump mentioned FBI Director James Comey, who decided that Clinton's actions did not rise to the level of prosecution. Trump said that Comey let her off the hook while other lives, including General Petraeus and many others, have been destroyed for doing far, far less. This is a conspiracy against you the American people and we cannot let this happen or continue. Trump has made similar comments before, which weve looked at in another report. But this time there is more information publicly available about the information practices of both Petreaus and Clinton.​So we decided to compare the two cases for the Truth-O-Meter. We're relying on Comey's statements because they were made under oath before two congressional committees, and he is one of the few people familiar with the circumstances and the secrets involved in both cases who is able to speak on the record. Comeys initial testimony Petraeus pled guilty in 2015 to a misdemeanor charge of mishandling confidential materials. He was fined $100,000 and given two years probation. He had given his mistress, Paula Broadwell, access to eight notebooks with top-secret and code information. She had made copies of over 300 documents marked secret. In addition, Petraeus lied to FBI agents investigating the case. In Clinton's case, the FBI found 110 emails with classified information on her server, eight of which were designated top secret. Comey, in a July 5 news conference, said there was no evidence of Clinton or her staff intending to violate the law. But he also said Clinton should have known that her handling of the emails was inappropriate, and that her behavior was extremely reckless because outsiders could hack her server. The FBI director was asked about the Clinton-Petraeus comparison during his July 7 appearance before the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee. Do you agree with the claim that General Petraeus, and I quote, 'Got in trouble for far less,' end of quote? Do you agree with that statement? asked Rep. Elijah Cummings, D-MD. No, it's the reverse, the FBI director said. Comey cited the Petraeus case as one that illustrates perfectly the kind of cases the Department of Justice is willing to prosecute. Even there, they prosecuted him for a misdemeanor. In that case, you had vast quantities of highlyclassified information, including special sensitive compartmented information. That's the reference to code words. (A) vast quantity of it, not only shared with someone without authority to have it, but we found it in a search warrant hidden under the insulation in his attic, and then he lied to us about it during the investigation, Comey said.(Later in the hearing, Comey said his staff had corrected him and the notebooks were found in Petraeus'desk, not his attic.) So you have obstruction of justice, you have intentional misconduct and a vast quantity of information, Comey said. He admitted he knew that was the wrong thing to do. That is a perfect illustration of the kind of cases that get prosecuted. In my mind, it illustrates importantly the distinction to this (Clinton) case. And General Petraeus did not admit to these facts when the FBI investigators first interviewed him, did he? Cummings asked. No, Comey said, he lied about it. Comey's subsequent testimony Eighty three days later, Comey was called before the House Judiciary Committee where Republicans tried to get him to change his mind about prosecuting Clinton, and Blake Farenthold, R-Tex., brought up the matter again. Farenthold: How do you respond to people who are saying that this is not how (the) average American would be treated. This is only how Hillary Clinton would be treated? Comey: When people tell you that others have been treated differently, demand from a trustworthy source the details of those cases because — I'm a very aggressive investigator, I was a very aggressive prosecutor — I have gone back through 40 years of cases, and I'm telling you under oath that to prosecute on these facts would be a double standard, because Jane and Joe Smith would not be prosecuted on these facts. Comey said that, at the FBI, if an agent uses an unclassified email system to do business and, while on that system, talks about classified topics you will be in big trouble with the FBI. I'm highly confident of that. I'm also confident, in fact certain, you would not be prosecuted. That's what folks tend to lump together. So I care deeply about what people think about the justice system and that it not have two standards. It does not, and this demonstrates it. Steven Aftergood, senior research analyst at the Federation of American Scientists and an expert on national security secrecy, said, FBI Director Comey's conclusions have unique weight because he was in a position to investigate and assess both cases in depth. The rest of us (including Trump) have to rely on what has been publicly reported or speculated upon. To me, Comey's conclusion is the end of the matter. Finally, it's worth noting that during the Oct. 4, 2016, vice presidential debate, a variant of the theme came up as Republican Mike Pence said, If your son or my son handled classified information the way Hillary Clinton did . . . they'd be court-martialed. Democrat Tim Kaine said, That is absolutely false, and you know that. The Washington Post Fact Checker, after noting that Clinton's Cabinet-level position made this an apples-to-oranges comparison, consulted about a dozen retired military lawyers and found there was no absolute answer at all. What we found was that its absolutely unclear, and is subject to prosecutorial discretion and the circumstances of each case, the Post reported. Technically, yes, a service member can be court-martialed for behavior like Clintons, but its more likely the person would face administrative action. And the administrative action would depend on each service members disciplinary history, the evidence available and prosecutorial discretion. We contacted several people at the Trump campaign noting Comey's testimony and asked for Trump's evidence. We didn't hear back. Our ruling Trump said Clinton was let off the hook for her email scandal while other lives, including General Petraeus and many others, have been destroyed for doing far, far less. The director of the FBI director, the man who has intimate knowledge of both cases, has repeatedly insisted under oath that the reverse is true. Petraeus case was worse because he intentionally passed a large amount of classified information to an unauthorized person and then lied about it to the FBI. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/e7a8b46e-fe2d-4fa1-b976-cedce2031a88",0,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,Mostly False

Final Rating: False  ","Says Kamala Harris said, If elected & you dont surrender your guns, I will sign an executive order & the police will show up at your door.","Sen. Kamala Harris has taken a strong stance on gun control, but has she actually threatened to send police to your house to take your guns? The short answer is no. But that hasnt stopped social media users from spreading a fabricated quote attributed to her that suggests otherwise. If elected & you dont surrender your guns, I will sign an executive order & the police will show up at your door, reads a post attributed to Harris, the newly selected running mate for presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden. Harris didnt say this. And there is no evidence Harris plans to force people to surrender their guns. The post was flagged as part of Facebooks efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The claim appears to be a mischaracterization of a pledge Harris made during a CNN Presidential Town Hall in April 2019. Upon being elected, I will give the United States Congress 100 days to get their act together and have the courage to pass reasonable gun safety laws, and if they fail to do it, then I will take executive action, Harris said during the town hall. Harris continued, clarifying what her executive action would encompass. And specifically what I will do is put in place a requirement that for anyone who sells more than five guns a year, they are required to do background checks when they sell those guns, Harris said. I will require that for any gun dealer that breaks the law, the ATF take their license. During the town hall, Harris did not discuss confiscating guns using law enforcement officers. Whats more, a commitment to use executive action can refer to more than just executive orders, as the Washington Post reported. At another campaign event in August 2019 in Las Vegas, Harris reiterated her pledge to take action on guns within 100 days of taking office. At that event, she said she would also use executive action to implement a ban on the importation of assault rifles into our country. In a follow-up question, Harris was asked what enforcement of an assault rifles ban might look like. A reporter is heard off-camera asking, Does it involve law enforcement essentially going to peoples houses looking for specific banned guns? Does it involve perhaps creating a database of people who are legal gun owners? What kind of process are we talking about here? Harris answered by referencing her experience as attorney general in California, when she said law enforcement was permitted to confiscate guns by going to the doors of people who were both found by a court to be a danger to themselves and others and were also on a list where they were precluded and prohibited from owning a gun because of a conviction. I have to stress, lawful gun ownership, that is one thing. Were talking about something else and we have to stop conflating and blending all these issues, Harris said. Harris did not say she planned to send law enforcement officers to the homes of all gun owners, as the post suggests. When we first spotted the false quote being shared Aug. 11 on a Facebook page called YET-iheart-NRA, PolitiFact reached out to the page administrator to ask what evidence they had to support the claim. Someone with the Facebook page responded, pointing us to an article from the blog Law Enforcement Today. That article referenced an exchange between Biden and Harris in the September 2019 Democratic presidential primary debate, found here. In it, debate moderator David Muir of ABCs World News Tonight pointed out that Harris said she planned to use executive action to ban imports of AR-15 assault weapons if Congress did not act quickly enough. Muir explained that Biden had expressed doubts about the future presidents constitutional authority to ban assault weapons via executive order, which Harris had not committed to doing. When asked if Bidens stated concern had a point, Harris jokingly replied, I mean I would just say, Hey Joe, instead of saying no we cant, lets say yes we can. Here again, there is no evidence she made the statement that is being attributed to her. (The post made by YET-iheart-NRA appears to have been removed since we inquired about it.) Other fact-checking organizations debunked similar claims that circulated online in 2019, but Harris new role as vice presidential candidate caused the claim to reemerge. Fact-checking organizations have continued debunking the claim after it reappeared. A post claims that vice presidential candidate Sen. Kamala Harris said, If elected & you dont surrender your guns, I will sign an executive order & the police will show up at your door. This quote is fabricated. When she was running for president, Harris pledged to take executive action on gun control within the first 100 days of her administration. She did not say she would require people to surrender their guns or say she would order law enforcement to collect guns.",0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,False

Final Rating: False  ",Ronald Reagans philosophy of peace through strength is why the Iranians released the hostages on the same day and at the same hour that Reagan was sworn in.,"During a March 6, 2012, video address to a conference of the American-Israel Public Affairs Committee, Mitt Romney seized the tough foreign policy mantle of President Ronald Reagan. I believe the right course is what Ronald Reagan called peace through strength, Romney told the pro-Israel group. There's a reason why the Iranians released the hostages on the same day and at the same hour that Reagan was sworn in. As president, I'll offer that kind of clarity, strength and resolve. But was Reagans peace through strength philosophy really responsible for freeing the 52 Americans who were taken hostage by Islamic militants and held for 444 days? First, a reminder of what the hostage crisis was all about. In 1979, the Shah of Iran -- who had been installed and supported by successive United States administrations -- was overthrown by Islamic revolutionaries. Militants took over the American embassy and held hostages from Nov. 4, 1979, until Jan. 20, 1981 -- the day President Jimmy Carter passed the reins to Reagan, who had defeated him amid widespread public disapproval of the incumbents handling of the crisis. Iran contacted the Carter administration in September 1980 with a proposal to end the hostage crisis, said Gary Sick, a Columbia University professor who has written two books about the Iran hostage crisis. The U.S. made a proposal. Iran responded with an unacceptable offer just a day or two before the election. Afterwards, they nominated the Algerians to act as intermediaries. Those valuable discussions went on until literally the day or two before the inauguration, and they were settled by the Iranians caving in on a number of issues that were extremely costly to them. By my calculations, the Iranians ended up paying about $300,000 per hostage per day of incarceration. The agreement that led to the release, as described by the New York Times 11 days after it occured, revolved around $11 billion to $12 billion in Iranian assets that Carter had frozen 10 days after the seizure of the U.S. embassy. It had been negotiated over the course of several months before Reagan's inauguration. The Times, in its account of the inauguration, reported that no one on the speaker's stand knew of the latest developments in Iran. Word quickly spread among the governors, Congressmen and Reagan friends, family and aides as they left the platform. Carter informed Reagan at 8:31 a.m. that the release of the hostages was imminent, but the onetime bitter rivals for the presidency told reporters as they entered the speaker's area separately, to the flourish of trumpets, that the hostages had not yet taken off from Tehran. The President got his first chance to announce the news at 2:15 p.m. at a luncheon with Congressional leaders in Statuary Hall in the Capitol. So Reagan, not Carter, got to bask in the glow of the hostages safe return. However, we contacted seven scholars of the period, and their consensus was that neither Reagan nor his philosophy played any significant role in freeing the hostages. Well before Reagan became president, the deal for releasing the hostages had already been worked out by the Carter administration's State Department and the Iranians, ably assisted by Algerian diplomats, said David Farber, a Temple University historian and author of Taken Hostage: The Iranian Hostage Crisis and America's First Encounter with Radical Islam. No Reagan administration officials participated in the successful negotiations, Farber added. The Iranian government waited to officially release the Americans until Carter had left the presidency as a final insult to Carter, whom they despised. They believed Carter had betrayed the Iranian revolution by allowing the self-exiled Shah to receive medical attention in the United States and then had threatened their new government by attempting, unsuccessfully, to use military force in April 1980 to free the hostages. By doing this, Iran thought they were showing the world that they could meddle in our affairs, just as we had done to them in 1953, added Dave Houghton, a political scientist at the University of Central Florida and author of U.S. Foreign Policy and the Iran Hostage Crisis. Houghton suggested that Iran had a relatively unsophisticated grasp of U.S. politics, and said he thinks its possible that the Iranians didnt even know what Reagan had said on the campaign trail. I don't think they were scared into the release, Houghton said. In all likelihood, they released the hostages because they needed the sanctions we'd placed on them lifted so they could finance their war with Iraq. The one scholar who entertained the possibility that Iran was taking heed of the future presidents philosophy was Michael Gunter, a political scientist at Tennessee Tech University and the author of several papers about the crisis. Still, Gunter added, the main reason for the release was that the mileage the Iranians had gained by holding the hostages had been used for everything it was worth and there was no further advantage in continuing. Several other experts agreed that the Iranians focus was on Carter, not Reagan. If it was related to the occupant of the White House, it certainly had more to do with Carter than Reagan, said Stephen Kinzer, a former New York Times reporter who now teaches at Boston University and authored the book, Reset: Iran, Turkey, and Americas Future. My guess is that the hostages would have been released even if someone else had been inaugurated -- anyone but Carter. The Iranians had come to hate Carter and didn't want to give him a triumph. Giving it to someone else was fine with them. Sick, the Columbia University professor, said that those who wish to believe that the final flurry of activity was out of fear of Reagan have a right to their opinion. Those closer to the events believed that the Iranians, who had clearly decided months earlier that the hostages were a wasting asset, feared that they would have to start the whole laborious process of negotiation over from scratch with a new administration, which obviously had no great appeal. The Romney campaign did not return an inquiry seeking backup for the candidates claim. Our ruling We cant read the Iranians minds, but seven scholars of the period told us that Reagans foreign policy approach was either a minor factor in the release of the hostages or not a factor at all. The fact that the deal was negotiated entirely by the Carter administration, without involvement by Reagan or his transition team, seems to support the expert consensus. Romney made a claim that flies in the face of history and offered no evidence to support it.",0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,False

Standing a few feet behind him and in front of millions of television viewers, Pelosi tore up a copy of Trumps 2020 State of the Union speech seconds after he finished giving the address. But despite an image you might have seen shared on Facebook, the California Democrat did not issue a tweet saying she was disgusted with Trump over taxes. The tweet attributed to her reads: I am disgusted with President Trump allowing people to keep more of the money they earn. It is this type of wide spread theft of public resources that keeps America from being great Mr. President. The image was flagged as part of Facebooks efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The supposed tweet is dated Dec. 20, 2017. Thats the day Congress passed a $1.5 trillion tax cut bill that Trump signed into law a few days later. Pelosi opposed the measure and Democrats criticized it as favoring the rich. While the blue-checked Twitter handle that appears in the image (@NancyPelosi) might seem legitimate, her actual Twitter account handle is @SpeakerPelosi. Whats more, she uses a different photo for her Twitter account than the one we see in this Facebook image. A Pelosi spokesman called the supposed tweet fiction. Hes right. It was outed as fake long ago. Snopes, in December 2017, and FactCheck.org, in October 2018, reported that the tweet was a fake, posted by Tweeterino, a fake-tweet generator that shut itself down in June 2018. It has also been debunked by the conservative-leaning Washington Examiner.

Revolution Signal.,"President Donald Trump has promoted a big protest in Washington, D.C., on Jan. 6, when Congress is scheduled to certify President-elect Joe Bidens victory in the 2020 election. But an image being spread online is not a sign that the president is calling for a revolution. 1776 flag flying over White House! reads the headline on a Jan. 4 blog post on the Hal Turner Radio Show website.

The storm is upon us. Rise-up, America. Rise up against the fraudulent election. This post was flagged as part of Facebooks efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The flag in the photo is washed out, but the blog post seems to be referring to the 13-star flag, the first official U.S. flag to fly after the countrys founding in 1776. However, the photo isnt recent. Dan Scavino, the White House deputy chief of staff, posted it on Instagram on June 1, 2019. We didnt find any media coverage about the White House flying the 13-star flag around that time, and it was in the news. Nike pulled Fourth of July sneakers featuring the flag over concerns that it was a symbol for racism. We also found no evidence that such a flag is currently flying over the White House. But in any case, the image that purportedly shows an older flag that Trump raised to rally an uprising is more than a year old.

Final Rating: Mostly False","Thirty million Americans, including a lot of people in Florida, are going to be able to get healthcare next year because of that law.","In a television interview with the Tampa Fox affiliate, President Barack Obama discussed last years sweeping health care legislation, a centerpiece of his re-election campaign and a favorite point of attack by his challengers.The law is designed to provide health insurance to nearly every American by creating insurance exchanges for people to purchase plans and expanding Medicaid for the poor. It includes an individual mandate requiring people to buy coverage in order to spread risk and costs across the population. That provision in particular is the subject of numerous court challenges and is the least popular aspect of the law.Interviewer Mark Wilson pointed to that fact in the Nov. 1, 2011, interview, noting 54 percent of Americans favor repealing some version some part of that law. As you know, Florida leads the way in repealing it. What would you do differently now with regards to health care reform, knowing what we know now?Obama responded by touting some of the laws benefits.Well, look, keep in mind a million young people around the country have health care that didn't have it before because they can stay on their parents health care plan. Millions of families all across the country benefited from additional drug benefits as a consequence of that health care plan, the president said. Thirty million Americans, including a lot of people in Florida, are going to be able to get health care next year because of that law.The next year part of that struck us as suspect, so we decided to check it out.The law and its many provisions are designed to take effect in steps over a period of years. The Kaiser Family Foundation has a timeline posted on its website explaining the phase-in.The changes set to take effect in 2012 mainly involve payments to Medicare.The individual mandate, along with Medicaid expansion and establishment of the insurance exchanges, doesn't kick in until 2014. Those are the provisions of the law expected to give millions of Americans access to health insurance, and thus health care.The Congressional Budget Office estimates that next year only about 1 million more Americans will gain health insurance. The figure balloons to 19 million in 2014, and 30 million in 2016 when those concrete changes are fully implemented.Parts of the law already up and running -- which have chipped away at the number of uninsured Americans -- include policies for people with pre-existing conditions and an allowance for young adults to remain on their parents health plans up to age 26.We asked the White House what Obamas next year claim was based on but did not hear back.In addition, as weve noted before, the individual mandate faces a significant battle in the courts and is likely to end up being decided by the U.S. Supreme Court. If it is ruled unconstitutional, the CBO projects that 16 million fewer people will become insured. Other studies put that reduction at between 8 million and 24 million.Our rulingObama said Thirty million Americans, including a lot of people in Florida, are going to be able to get healthcare next year because of that law.The CBO, a nonpartisan source, predicts only 1 million people will benefit in 2012, with the significant increases coming in 2014 and 2016. Plus, the laws future is uncertain.The president is understandably enthusiastic about seeing his signature legislation take effect. But he misstated the timing of how many people will gain health insurance and when. Its not happening next year.",0,0.5,1,0.5,0,0,0.5,0,0.5,Mostly False

Final Rating: False","In the class of 1968 at Patrice Lumumba University in Moscow, Mahmoud Abbas was one of the members of that class, and so was Ali Khamenei. And that's where they first established relationships with the young Vladimir Putin.","It sounds like the opening to a joke: A young Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas, Iranian Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei and Russian President Vladimir Putin walk into a Soviet-era Moscow university  But its a claim that was made with a straight face by Republican presidential candidate Ben Carson -- on national television, three times. First, on the Oct. 5, 2015, edition of the Fox News show Hannity, Carson said Putinsrelationships go way, way, way, way back, you know? 1968 at Patrice Lumumba University -- that's when Putin first got to know the Ali Khamenei, and also Mahmoud Abbas. Then, on Oct. 8, Carson said much the same thing to CNN anchor Wolf Blitzer. Putin already has substantial ties in the Middle East, Carson said. In the class of 1968 at Patrice Lumumba University in Moscow, Mahmoud Abbas was one of the members of that class, and so was Ali Khamenei. And that's where they first established relationships with the young Vladimir Putin. And then again to Andrea Mitchell on MSNBC on Oct. 9: Putin has longstanding relationships with people in that area. In the class of 1968 at Patrice Lumumba University in Moscow, Mahmoud Abbas was in that class, and so was Ali Khamenei. And that was when they first became familiar with Putin. Really? Three future world leaders -- and three people many Americans consider adversaries -- found themselves kicking around a university in Moscow in 1968, building ties that would serve them decades later? We had to check it out. When we asked Carsons staff whether they had any supporting evidence, aide Ying Ma wrote back, Thanks for your inquiry. We are not in the habit of providing Googling support to the media. If there is a specific aspect of Dr. Carson's statement that you wish to challenge, please let us know and we can go from there. We did have difficulty finding any support for the claim, and we forwarded what we found to the campaign but did not hear back. Heres a rundown, point by point. Mahmoud Abbas The portion of the claim dealing with Abbas has the most supporting evidence, but even here its not all that clear-cut. Its fairly well documented that Abbas -- the head of theWest Bank-based Palestinian government -- did do some academic work in the Soviet Union. This part of Abbas biography gained some attention in 1995, when Abbas became a key Palestinian figure in the Oslo peace accords. Reports surfaced that Abbas had written a doctoral thesis in the early 1980s titled, The Other Side: The Secret Relationship between Nazism and the Zionist Movement. Critics, including the Simon Wiesenthal Center, criticized the thesis for seeming to minimize the Holocaust, and he later distanced himself from some of its conclusions. The importance of Abbas thesis for our fact-check is that it was presented at a Soviet university, variously described as Oriental College, the Institute of Oriental Studies or Moscow State University. Oddly, Wikipedia is the only source that citesPatrice Lumumba University, an institution of higher education in Moscow that was designed to serve an international student clientele and which has been linked by some observers to the KGB. (Its now known as Peoples' Friendship University.) We did track down one possibly credible source placing Abbas at Lumumba -- a 2010 article from Ria Novosti, a state-owned news agency. Contrary to popular myths, (Patrice Lumumba University) released from its walls not too many successful politicians -- about a dozen future ministers and only two future leaders of their countries, the article said. In addition to a president of Guyana, the article cited Abbas, who graduated from the law faculty, the article said. Still, a degree from Patrice Lumumba doesnt appear in most biographies of Abbas. He is more often listed as having earned his law degree (or in some tellings, a bachelors degree) from the University of Damascus. In addition, most bios place Abbas working for Palestinian organizations in 1967 and 1968. He would have been 33 in 1968, the year Carson cited. So what do we know about Abbas? We know for sure that he took short visits to Moscow to defend his doctoral thesis around 1982 (where, apparently, he always drank coffee with cardamom, according to a 2005 Russian media account by a former professor). Its also conceivable that Abbas had some connection with Patrice Lumumba University, though the evidence of that is equivocal. But theres no hard evidence that Abbas was at Lumumba in 1968, which is what Carson said. Ali Khamenei There is no mention in the official biography of Irans supreme leader that he ever studied in the Soviet Union, and the timeline thats known would have made it difficult for him to have done so. We did not hear back from the Iranian mission to the United Nations, but Ali Alfoneh, a researcher at the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies, looked into the question in 2012 when he was at the American Enterprise Institute. He wrote, According to Khameneis official biography, he travelled to Iraq in 1957 to study at the Theological Seminary in Najaf. Since the Peoples Friendship University was first established (as Lumumba) in 1960, the young Khamenei could not have used his journey to Iraq as a cover for his studies in the Soviet Union. On the other hand, Alfoneh continued, Khameneis biography says he spent a clandestine life in Tehran between March 1966 and March 1967, after which he was arrested by the police and imprisoned. The existence of this clandestine period may have fed the rumor that he spent time studying in Moscow. Certainly a period studying in the godless Soviet Union would be something Khamenei -- the head of a theocracy -- would want to keep under wraps. In an interview, Alfoneh said he isnt convinced of the Khamenei-in-the-Soviet-Union claim. I'm very skeptical, he said. So where did this rumor come from? The allegations garnered attention in 2010 when RT, a network tightly controlled by Putins Kremlin, aired a piece about the 50th anniversary of Peoples' Friendship University and mentioned in passing that Khamenei was an alumnus. (We tried to contact the university, but didnt get a response. Neither Abbas nor Khamenei is listed among the schools eminent graduates.) The earlier citations of this claim arent well sourced, either. It appears to have surfaced initially in a 1989 column by Smith Hempstone, a journalist and future U.S. ambassador to Kenya, that ran in a small, western Pennsylvania newspaper. We also found a brief article in a Russian newspaper from 2003 that mentions the claim in passing. None of these approximate a primary source. A half-dozen experts on the region unanimously told us that they doubted Khamenei ever studied in the Soviet Union -- or that he did so in 1968, when he would have been 29. I've never seen it corroborated, said Karim Sadjadpour, a senior associate at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. John Limbert, a professor of international affairs at the U.S. Naval Academy, called the idea bizarre. And David Houghton, a senior lecturer in the defense studies department at Kings College of London, called it unlikely in the absolute extreme. The Soviet Union is the absolute last place where one could expect to find Khamenei at any stage in his career, and I personally do not believe that he ever studied there or had any links to Putin, Houghton said. It looks like a rather daft conspiracy theory to me. Vladimir Putin The biggest problem for the Putin portion of Carsons claim is the calendar: In 1968, Putin would have been 16 years old. According to his official biography, in 1960-1968, Vladimir Putin attended Primary School No. 193 in Leningrad. After the eighth grade, he entered High School No. 281, a chemistry-focused magnet school under the aegis of a technology institute, completing his studies there in 1970. Its pretty difficult to imagine that he could have met Messrs. Abbas and Khamenei under any circumstances at age 16 in Moscow, unless he ran into them randomly on the street on some kind of school or family trip — if, indeed, they were actually there, said Fiona Hill, director of the Center on the United States and Europe at the Brookings Institution. In addition, Putin grew up in Leningrad (now St. Petersburg). That is a 9-to-10-hour car ride from Moscow and Patrice Lumumba University. He studied between 1970 and 1975 in the law faculty of Leningrad State University, saidRichard Sakwa, a professor of Russian and European politics at the University of Kent. The claim by Ben Carson is garbled rubbish. A defense The closest we came to any of this making sense was an interview with Cliff Kincaid, who runs a group called Americas Survival, Inc. Kincaid published a paper titled, Communists and Muslims: The Hidden Hand of the KGB that raises many of these claims. Kincaid made the case that Carson was saying Abbas and Khamenei could have been agents of the KGB, and if they were, Putin, who rose to colonel in the KGB, would have known them. Carson was clearly saying that Putin, as a former KGB colonel and later head of the FSB, the new name for the KGB, would have knowledge of Abbas and Khamenei attending Patrice Lumumba University, a KGB-controlled institution, Kincaid told PolitiFact. That made them subject to KGB influence, if not KGB agents. Whether Putin personally met them in his younger years is beside the point.  Please report these facts rather than nitpick Carson on the ages of the various players. We hereby report those facts. Still, this isnt what Carson said. Our ruling Carson said, In the class of 1968 at Patrice Lumumba University in Moscow, Mahmoud Abbas was one of the members of that class, and so was Ali Khamenei. And that's where they first established relationships with the young Vladimir Putin. This is one of the more bizarre claims weve heard so far in the 2016 presidential campaign, and thats saying something. Abbas may have attended the university, though we dont know for sure, or when. No credible evidence has yet surfaced to place Khamenei as a student in the Soviet Union -- ever, much less in close proximity to Abbas, or in 1968. And Putin would have been a teenager in 1968, attending school 450 miles away. The idea that the three men developed lifelong ties as students in the late-1960s-era Soviet Union is ridiculous.

An article on fake news website Politicono.com got that fact right but nothing else. The Dec. 3 article carried the headline, Sarah Palin Calls To Boycott Mall Of America Because Santa Was Always White In The Bible. The article quoted Palin as saying people should run the Mall of America into the ground, on the basis of Santa always having been white in the Bible, and, No, I refuse to believe that they went this far in trying to cater to the minorities, I thought the company had some backbone but I guess I was wrong, The former Alaska governor and 2008 Republican vice presidential candidate never said these things. Politicono.com, which calls itself a hybrid news/satire platform, takes real news hooks and builds fake stories on top of them. Every article has a show facts button to illuminate which parts of the story are real and those that are fabricated. When you click the show facts button on the Palin article, it highlights as fact the first paragraph, which is about the Mall of Americas real decision to hire a black Santa. But the entire rest of the article, detailing Palins supposed call to boycott the mall because of the Bibles teachings on Santa, is completely made up. Dear Democrats, this is what fake news actually looks like, and I guarantee you no Trump voter actually fell for this, Palin wrote on Facebook Dec. 20, with a link to a Breitbart article debunking the Politicono.com post. Politicano.com is more forthcoming than other fake news sites about the fact that it posts made-up content. But its still not immediately apparent that its editors fabricated the story claiming Palin said she would boycott the Mall of America because Santa was always white in the Bible.",0,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,False

Final Rating: False","Says Paul Ryan said that 22 million Americans choose to be poor, so its their own problem if they cant afford to be healthy.","A story that claimed House Speaker Paul Ryan said millions of people have willingly elected to be impoverished is fake news. A June 28, 2017, post on Politicot.com ran under the headline, Paul Ryan: 22 million Americans choose to be poor, so its their own problem if they cant afford to be healthy. Facebook users flagged the post as part of the social media sites efforts to fight fake news. The post started out with real comments Speaker Ryan, R-Wis., made on Fox & Friends on June 27 while discussing the Congressional Budget Office report for the Senates health care bill. What they're basically saying at the Congressional Budget Office is, if you're not going to force people to buy Obamacare, if youre not going to force people to buy something they dont want, then they won't buy it, Ryan said. So it's not that people are getting pushed off a plan. It's that people will choose not to buy something they don't like or want.) Then the Politicot.com story said Ryan launched into a tirade to Foxs Brian Kilmeade about how people should be able to provide for themselves and their families through hard work. Thats where the story turned to fiction. Being rich or poor is a matter of choice; thats all there is to it, Ryan is quoted. So, let me ask you this, Brian: if 22 million people consciously make the choice to not work hard day in and day out, why on earth should the rest of us be concerned with whether or not theyre going to be healthy? If they choose to be poor, then its their own problem if they cant afford to be healthy. Ryan didnt say that last part, because this story was posted on a parody site that makes up all manner of bogus news stories. We reached out to Ryans office but a spokeswoman did not give any comment on the fake quotes. Politicot.com is part of a network of sites related to Newslo.com, which refers to itself in a disclaimer as the first hybrid News/Satire platform on the web. The Politicot.com site is registered to an administrator named Eli Sompo, who runs sites based in Israel and Greece. Sompo has told us he did not write the stories on the websites for which he is responsible, but has several clients. He informed us months ago that he would block any future questions from PolitiFact about the sites. What makes Newslo.com-related stories especially confusing is that they use a small piece of real news or quotes by real people and build fake stories around them. In most cases it is the first paragraph of the story, as happened here. The websites feature a pair of buttons that allow readers to highlight the true parts of their stories, so readers can conceivably know the difference. But it isnt always obvious thats the aim, leading the audience to believe the entire story is true — especially when other fake news sites steal the articles and post them without any warning at all. Ryan did discuss how the Senates proposed legislation would affect poor people, but he never said 22 million people choose to be poor",0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,False

Final Rating: False",Says Jeb Bush has released 10 percent of his emails.,"Hillary Clinton might be in a bit of hot water for using a private email account for official business as secretary of state, but Democrats eagerly point to similar email issues with presumptiveRepublican presidential candidate Jeb Bush. As governor of Florida, Bush burnished his tech and public access credentials by using a personal email account to supplement the one the state provided. Prior to Clintons troubles, Bush set up a special website for the public to browse any of those emails that dealt with official business. Like Clinton, Bush himself determined which ones were private and which would be made public, but the move was largely seen as a way to mark Bush as a candidate who walks the walk when it comes to transparency. This led Democratic activist James Carville to challenge how transparent Bush really is. Jeb Bush has released 10 percent of his emails, Carville said on ABCs This Week, March 15, 2015. He had a private email server. He destroyed his emails. We decided to check Carvilles numbers. Carvilles assistant, Kees Nordin, gave PunditFact the underlying math. The fact is that of Jeb Bush's 3 million emails (public and private) he's only released 275,000 or just under 10 percent, Nordin said. According to Bushspokeswoman Kristy Campbell, Bush posted nearly 280,000 emails from his personal email account on a website he set up, jebbushemails.com. Back in 2007, Bush gave an off-the-cuff estimate that during his eight years in office he received about 550,000 emails at his personal address [emailprotected]. We tried to confirm that number, but Campbell said Its immaterial as they are not subject to public records request and not required by law to be retained. In the same interview in 2007, Bush said an additional 2.5 million emails came through other email accounts run by the state. So this is how Carville gets to a grand total of 3 million emails. The question is, did Bush reveal just 275,000 -- or 280,000 -- of them? The answer is no, because most of them have been, and remain, publicly available. Under Florida law, most of Bush's emails to his government accounts are a public record and accessible to people who request them, said Barbara Petersen, president of Floridas First Amendment Foundation. (The First Amendment Foundation advocates for government transparency and receives major support from foundations and Floridas news organizations, including the Tampa Bay Times.) Anything relating to public business is a public record in Florida, Petersen said. If you comment on a policy, even if the rest of the email is personal, it will be subject to a public records request. Its a fairly broad definition. Importantly, all of the emails sent to accounts run by the state would have been seen and vetted by state workers, not private staffers or lawyers employed by Bush. They remain the custodian of those records, andPetersen said shebelieves most of the Bush emails from his official accounts have been retained. The first stop for those emails would be the Citizen Services office, which fields all incoming communications to the governor. While some emails might be purely personal or otherwise exempt and would not be released, they were still part of the states public record. The point being, only the 550,000 emails sent to Bushs personal account would have remained under his exclusive control. The rest remain housed with the state government. What's the point? We can confidently say that the 280,000 emails on the Bush website represent just a fraction of the total number of emails that are public. While the precise figures are unclear, if 2.5 million emails went to one of the state-run email accounts then all of those were subject to a public records request. So in a rough sense, close to 90 percent of the universe of 3 million emailsare public in some form. If you look at just Bush's private emails, about 50 percent are public. Neither number is close to the one Carville cited. We reached out to state officials to see if they can add any information about the number of officialemails thatare part of Bush's record. Wewill update this item if we learn further details. A few notes Carville said Bush had a private email server. According to press reports, Bush used a server located in the governor's office. He took the server with him when he left office. Carville also said Bush destroyedthe emails he hadnt revealed. We asked how he knew that and got no reply.Petersen had the same question and noted that Florida law presents a hurdle to destroying emails. If you made a public record request of Jebs email and you thought you didn't get them all, you can file suit in civil court and request an in camera inspection by a judge, she said. Petersen said the state judges which records have archival value and which ones are trivial and can be disposed. Our ruling Carville said that Bush revealed 10 percent of his emails and he destroyed his emails. The numbers dont add up. The numbers used by Carville himself include 2.5 million emails sent to state run accounts. Those emails are subject to a public records request. It is completely inaccurate to say that Bush only revealed 275,000 or 280,000 emails out of a total of 3 million. A more accurate reading would be that he revealed about half of the emails sent to his private account, and the rest were already available to the press, although some might be held back if they were strictly personal in nature.",0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,False

A new rumor on Facebook suggests that environmental factors connected to climate change, like severe heat and drought, have nothing to do with the fires. Instead the post pins much of the destruction on one man. The Sept. 20 post features the mans mugshot and implores users to meet mr. climate change and says hes responsible for lighting 32 of the wildfires. The man in the image, Brandon McGlover, did light fires in California, and he was arrested and sentenced for it — but it happened in 2018, and there werent 32 fires. The post was flagged as part of Facebooks efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) In July 2018, deputies from the Riverside County Sheriff's Department in California arrested Brandon N. McGlover on charges of five counts of arson to wildland. (The amount of fires linked to McGlover was later upped to nine.) One of the fires McGlover was accused of setting became the Cranston Fire, which destroyed multiple buildings, forced thousands of evacuations, and burned over 13,000 acres before it was fully contained. Contemporaneous news reports said that a heat wave in California exacerbated the fires spread. McGlover pleaded guilty to arson charges for the Cranston Fire in 2019 and was sentenced to 12 years in prison. Fire officials and experts believe that the West Coasts 2020 wildfire season has been mostly fueled by a combination of severe drought, historic heat, lightning storms and heavy winds. RELATED: Climate change created conditions for the West Coast fires, experts say There are a couple of exceptions. A man was arrested on charges of arson and cultivating marijuana in connection with Californias Dolan Fire, and officials said San Bernardino Countys El Dorado Fire was caused by a device at a gender reveal party. A post suggests climate change has nothing to do with the fires burning in the Western U.S., blaming instead one man for setting 32 wildfires. That isnt true. Brandon McGlover was arrested in 2018 for lighting nine fires in southwest California and is currently serving a 12-year prison sentence. Also, experts say that climate change has modified environments in the West Coast, making them more conducive to wildfires.",0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,False

The upscale condo near Miami Beach still collapsed Champlain Towers South Condo in Surfside near Miami Beach was completed in 1981. A recent condo sold for $710,000 at the oceanside. The post, which included photos of the collapse and a map indicating the proximity of Ivanka Trumps residence to that building, was flagged as part of Facebooks efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The day after the collapse, with search-and-rescue efforts still under way, officials said they did not know the cause of the collapse and that it would be some time before an investigation can try to find the cause. The Champlain Towers South, a 12-story condo building constructed in 1981 in Surfside, a town northeast of Miami, partially collapsed early on the morning of June 24. At a media briefing the next afternoon, Miami-Dade County Mayor Daniella Levine Cava said four people had died and 159 remained unaccounted for, but that the numbers were fluid. She said that although search-and-rescue efforts continue, structural engineers eventually would investigate what might have caused the collapse. Republican Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis also made it clear that it would take some time before an investigation of a possible cause can be fully undertaken. He said: We need a definitive explanation for how this could have happened, and thats an explanation that needs to be an accurate explanation, its an explanation that we dont want to get wrong, obviously, but at the same time I do think its important that its timely. Engineering and architectural experts told the New York Times it could take a long time to determine the cause of the collapse, but that possibilities include corroded components, an undermined foundation, or defects in the construction or design. Shimon Wdowinski, a professor in the Department of Earth and Environment at Florida International University in Miami, said the building showed signs of land subsidence — a gradual settling or sudden sinking of the Earths surface — in the 1990s, according to space-based radar data he analyzed. But land subsidence alone likely would not cause a buildings collapse, he said. Several engineering experts suggested a number of factors could have played a role, including saltwater corroding the concrete and potentially weakening beams that hold up the structure, the Miami Herald reported. Scientists have long noted the risk of building on the shifting sands of a barrier island such as Miami Beach, especially with rising sea levels, NBC News reported. That may not be the reason for this collapse, but it remains an engineering challenge in the region, the network said. According to news reports, the Miami home of Ivanka Trump and her husband, Jared Kushner, both of whom served as White House aides under Donald Trump, is a block away from the building that collapsed.

Final Rating: False  ","The COVID-19 vaccines make people magnetized. They can put a key on their forehead, it sticks. They can put spoons and forks all over them, and they can stick.","An anti-vaccine activist falsely claimed during a hearing with Ohio state legislators that the COVID-19 vaccines are magnetizing people who get them. Dr. Sherri Tenpenny, an Ohio-based osteopathic physician who wrote a book called Saying No to Vaccines, has been identified by the news site rating service Newsguard as a super-spreader of COVID-19 vaccine misinformation. A watchdog group found that she is one of 12 influencers responsible for 65% of anti-vaccine misinformation spread on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter. Tenpenny has previously pushed false claims that the COVID-19 vaccines can cause death and autoimmune disease, disrupt pregnancies and shed to affect unvaccinated people. Her latest comments came as she testified at the invitation of Ohios Republican lawmakers in favor of a bill that would prevent businesses or the government from requiring proof of COVID-19 vaccination, according to the Columbus Dispatch. Im sure youve seen the pictures all over the internet of people whove had these shots, and now theyre magnetized, Tenpenny said during the June 8 hearing. They can put a key on their forehead, it sticks. They can put spoons and forks all over them, and they can stick. Because now we think that theres a metal piece to that. Those claims are baseless. There are no metallic ingredients in any of the COVID-19 vaccines approved in the U.S. for emergency use, from Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna and Johnson & Johnson. The Food and Drug Administration has published the ingredients for each online. Theres nothing there that a magnet can interact with, Thomas Hope, a vaccine researcher at Northwestern University, previously told AFP Fact Check. Its protein and lipids, salts, water and chemicals that maintain the pH. Thats basically it, so this is not possible. PolitiFact and several other fact-checkers previously debunked the videos and pictures all over the internet that Tenpenny cited as proof, which purported to show magnets sticking to vaccinated people. The social media posts about vaccine magnetism were so widespread that the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention addressed them on its website: Can receiving a COVID-19 vaccine cause you to be magnetic? No. Receiving a COVID-19 vaccine will not make you magnetic, including at the site of vaccination which is usually your arm. COVID-19 vaccines do not contain ingredients that can produce an electromagnetic field at the site of your injection. All COVID-19 vaccines are free from metals such as iron, nickel, cobalt, lithium, and rare earth alloys, as well as any manufactured products such as microelectronics, electrodes, carbon nanotubes, and nanowire semiconductors. In addition, the typical dose for a COVID-19 vaccine is less than a milliliter, which is not enough to allow magnets to be attracted to your vaccination site even if the vaccine was filled with a magnetic metal. Florian Krammer, a professor of vaccinology at New York'sIcahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, previously told PolitiFact the claims about vaccine magnetism were utter nonsense. Other experts told AFP Fact Check that the metal objects highlighted in various online videos and images are likely sticking for other reasons. They could have tape or another adhesive on them, for example. Or they could appear to stick because of the oil on a persons skin. Later on in the Ohio House hearing, a nurse tried unsuccessfully to prove Tenpennys theory by positioning a key and a bobby pin against her neck. Explain to me why the key sticks to me. It sticks to my neck too, she said, even as the key she pressed to her neck did notstick.  Wow.

Final Rating: Mostly False  ",President Barack Obama said at the beginning of the negotiations that the basic approach was to dismantle Irans nuclear program in exchange for dismantling the sanctions.,"In the wake of the newly completed Iran nuclear agreement, a number of Republicans have charged that the Obama administration has struck a deal that they see as dangerous and inadequate. Among them is freshman Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., a frequent critic of Obamas foreign policy. In an appearance on CNN on July 15, Cotton lamented what he saw as a weak agreement: He (Obama) said at the beginning of the negotiations that the basic approach was to dismantle Iran's nuclear program in exchange for dismantling the sanctions. In fact, we are going to keep Iran's nuclear program in place. In fact, Western countries are going to help Iran develop advanced capabilities. We decided to check the claim that the administrations original intent was to dismantle Irans nuclear program in exchange for dismantling the sanctions. Which nuclear program? Since Iran has long asserted that it has a right to pursue nuclear energy -- as distinct from nuclear weapons -- a key question for us was whether the term nuclear program referred narrowly to nuclear weapons or more broadly to any kind of nuclear research, including nuclear energy. Its easy to see how a speaker could say nuclear program when they actually intended to say nuclear weapons program. The answer, according to Cottons staff, is that the senator was referring to the nuclear program as a whole, not simply the weapons program. Cottons staff also pointed PolitiFact to some quotes from Obamas 2012 presidential debate against Mitt Romney to back up their claim. In the debate, Obama boasted of the success of sanctions in paving a way forward for negotiations: The work that weve done with respect to sanctions now offers Iran a choice. They can take the diplomatic route and end their nuclear program or they will have to face a united world and a United States president, me, who said were not going to take any options off the table, he said. He alluded to Iran either giving up or ending their nuclear program — he didnt specify that he was referring to the Iranian nuclear weapons program — two more times during the debate. However, this wouldnt have been, as Cotton said, at the beginning of negotiations -- the first meeting between Secretary of State John Kerry and his Iranian counterparts was held on Sept. 26, 2013. (Here's a detailed timeline.) So we decided to see if we could find some stronger evidence. As it happens, a pro-Israel group, the Israel Project, also made a statement much like Cottons, and a spokeswoman pointed us to several pieces of evidence.  One is a remark by Kerry before the House Foreign Affairs Committee on Dec. 10, 2013, right around the time negotiations were kicking into gear. But I dont think that any of us thought we were just imposing these sanctions for the sake of imposing them. We did it because we knew that it would hopefully help Iran dismantle its nuclear program. That was the whole point of the regime. Upon examining the full context of Kerrys speech, however, it becomes clear that Kerry was not referring to the strategy of the White House, but rather to his own time in the Senate, and he seems to reflect the mind-set he and his fellow senators had toward sanctions. I will tell you that in my 29 years, just about shy of the full 29 Ive served in the Senate, I was always a leading proponent of the sanctions against Iran. Im proud of what we did here. But it was undeniable that the pressure we put on Iran through these sanctions is exactly what has brought Iran to the table today, and I think Congress deserves an enormous amount of credit for that, said Kerry. Only then does he add, But I dont think that any of us thought we were just imposing these sanctions for the sake of imposing them. We did it because we knew that it would hopefully help Iran dismantle its nuclear program. That was the whole point of the regime. The Israel Project also pointed us to a comment by Wendy Sherman, the under secretary of state for political affairs, during a PBS interview on Dec. 4, 2013. Asked whether a comprehensive agreement will include dismantling, full dismantling, Sherman replied, This includes a lot of dismantling of their infrastructure  At the end of the day, what is critical here is that the international community and the United States of America must have full confidence that Iran truly has a peaceful program. But Shermans statement refers to a lot of dismantling, which is short of a full dismantling. Contrary evidence Perhaps the most definitive refutation of Cottons claim comes from Obama himself, in an appearance on Dec. 7, 2013, at a Middle East policy forum -- again, right around when the negotiations were starting. If we could create an option in which Iran eliminated every single nut and bolt of their nuclear program and forswore the possibility of ever having a nuclear program, and for that matter got rid of all its military capabilities, I would take it. But I want to make sure everybody understands it — that particular option is not available. So as a consequence, what we have to do is make a decision as to, given the options available, what is the best way for us to (ensure) Iran does not get a nuclear weapon? This suggests that the Obama administration was focused not on completely eliminating the Iranian nuclear program, but rather on blocking the pathway to a nuclear weapon. It has not been the goal of the George W. Bush administration or the Obama administration to completely dismantle every aspect of their nuclear program, said Daryl Kimball, executive director of the Arms Control Association, a group that aims to educate the public on arms control policy. He added, Look at the context — (the U.S.) goal is to dismantle, curtail, reduce, to the point (Iran) cannot acquire a nuclear weapon. Nobody is arguing about completely eliminating the nuclear program. The time element of Cottons claim is one of its most problematic features. If Cotton had been referring to statements Obama made before he was president, he would have had a better argument, experts say. Theres a difference between what the president has said about the nuclear program while he was in the process of trying to get elected and comments that he has made when trying to garner support in Congress and then today, when trying to explain what he has, said Richard Brennan, a political scientist at the Rand Corp. Brennan pointed us to a March 2007 speech Obama made in Chicago to the American-Israel Public Affairs Committee, a pro-Israel group. In his remarks, Obama said, The world must work to stop Irans uranium enrichment program and prevent Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons. Uranium enrichment is a key component of any nuclear program, not simply a nuclear weapons program, so this could be interpreted as Obama talking about more than simply preventing Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon. On balance, Brennan agreed with other experts we checked with that, on its face, Cottons statement was probably not accurate. By the time negotiations seriously began in late 2013, the administration had changed its position to ensuring primarily that Iran did not have a nuclear weapon. Our ruling Cotton said that Obama said at the beginning of the negotiations that the basic approach was to dismantle Irans nuclear program in exchange for dismantling the sanctions. In 2007 or even as late as 2012, that might have been true, though believing so requires some careful parsing of the words and intentions of Obama and his advisers. Still, by late 2013 -- the negotiation period Cotton specifically referred to -- the administration had settled on a strategy of blocking a pathway to a nuclear weapon, rather than eliminating any trace of nuclear activities in Iran, including energy. On Dec. 7, 2013, Obama himself explicitly repudiated the idea that it would be possible to fully dismantle every single nut and bolt of their nuclear program.",0.3,0.7,0.9,0.5,0.2,0.6,0.4,0.2,0.4,Mostly False

Final Rating: False  ","The House voted to cap insulin prices to $35/month, just $420 each year! Richard Hudson voted NO.","With inflation high and many Americans concerned about COVID-19, a Democratic congressional candidate in North Carolina says a Republican incumbent isnt doing enough to ease the burden of medical costs. State Sen. Ben Clark, D-Hoke, is running in the states newly-drawn 9th Congressional District, where hell face Republican U.S. Rep. Richard Hudson if both win their primaries. The district, which leans Republican, is located in south-central North Carolina near Fayetteville. On April 1, Clarks campaign emailed supporters slamming Hudson for how he voted the day before. The email said: Yesterday, the House voted to cap insulin prices to $35/month, just $420 each year! Richard Hudson voted NO. Clarks campaign also tweeted about Hudson, posting that he voted no to lowering the cost of insulin for every family in the 9th Congressional District. What legislation was Clark talking about? And did Hudson really vote against lowering insulin costs? A review of the record shows Clark got this wrong. The U.S. House of Representatives on March 31 voted on H.R.6833, known as the Affordable Insulin Now Act, which would cap insulin co-payments for insured Americans at $35 a month.It would help some Americans save hundreds of dollars annually and offer all insured patients more predictable insulin costs, but wouldnt help the uninsured, the Associated Press reported. The Democrat-led bill passed 232-193 with the help of 12 Republicans — and congressional records show Hudson was one of them. Several media outlets — including Business Insider, the Daily Mail and Yahoo! News — named Hudson among the bills Republican supporters. PolitiFact NC reached out to Clarks campaign shortly after it published the email and tweet about Hudsons vote. The campaign, which deleted its tweet about Hudson, defended its accusations. As far as we know, the Clark campaign hasnt issued a correction to its email. We are aware that last night Richard Hudson changed his vote on capping the cost of insulin to $35/month after voting against this and other bills to reduce the cost of prescription drugs numerous times, the campaign said. After being consistently rated as one of the most conservative Republicans in the House, no one is fooled by his recent shift to the center. We asked the campaign what it meant when it said Hudson changed his vote, but didnt receive a response. Hudsons office said the congressmans March 31 vote is in line with other efforts to reduce insulin prices. Jordan Shaw, one of Hudsons advisors, said Hudson co-sponsored the Lower Costs, More Cures Act of 2019, or H.R. 19, which would have capped the cost of insulin for some Medicare customers. Congressman Hudson was proud to vote to cap out-of-pocket costs for seniors on insulin, and has long advocated for caps on prescription drug costs like those in HR 19. He didnt change his vote, Shaw said. Clark said: Yesterday, the House voted to cap insulin prices to $35/month, just $420 each year! Richard Hudson voted NO. The congressional record and multiple media reports show Hudson voted yes.",0,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,False

Final Rating: False  ",The Democrat(ic) position on abortion is now so extreme that they dont mind executing babies AFTER birth.,"On Feb. 25, the Senate took up a bill backed by anti-abortion advocates called the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act. Under the bill, any infant born alive after an abortion or within a hospital, clinic, or other facility has the same claim to the protection of the law that would arise for any newborn, or for any person who comes to a hospital, clinic, or other facility for screening and treatment or otherwise becomes a patient within its care. The bill goes on to say that anyone (except the mother) who intentionally performs or attempts to perform an overt act that kills a child born alive can be prosecuted for intentionally killing or attempting to kill a human being. The bill failed on a procedural motion, with 53 votes in favor when 60 were needed to advance it. The only senators who crossed party lines were Democrats who voted in favor of the measure: Bob Casey of Pennsylvania, Doug Jones of Alabama, and Joe Manchin of West Virginia. Later that day, President Donald Trump registered his disappointment in a pair of linked tweets: Senate Democrats just voted against legislation to prevent the killing of newborn infant children. The Democrat position on abortion is now so extreme that they dont mind executing babies AFTER birth. This will be remembered as one of the most shocking votes in the history of Congress. If there is one thing we should all agree on, its protecting the lives of innocent babies. Senate Democrats just voted against legislation to prevent the killing of newborn infant children. The Democrat position on abortion is now so extreme that they dont mind executing babies AFTER birth.... Those are strong words. We wondered: Is it true that the Democrats vote against the bill mean that theydont mind executing babies AFTER birth? After interviewing a range of experts on both sides of the abortion-policy divide, we concluded that while Democrats have left themselves open to this line of attack, Trumps claim is inaccurate. (The White House did not respond to an inquiry.) Broadly, critics of the bill said that it would take decisions out of the hands of parents and medical professionals and hand it to politicians. Democrats also argued that the number of relevant cases is vanishingly small, and usually involve heartbreaking situations that often have specific, unusual factors at play that are hard to accommodate in advance. Because of this, they saw the bill as a chance for Republicans to embarrass Democrats rather than as a genuine piece of legislation aiming to solve a significant problem. Perhaps the Democrats most basic argument in the context of Trumps charge, however, is that laws already exist to cover the scenario the bill would seek to prevent, making the new bill redundant. In a floor speech before the vote, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said, It has always been illegal to harm a newborn infant. This vote has nothing—nothing—to do with that. Read the language. Sen. Patty Murray of Washington, the ranking Democrat on the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, echoed that argument. This bill is not about protecting infants, as Republicans have claimed, because that is not up for debate and it is already the law, she said. Most legal experts we contacted agreed with this much of the Democrats argument: Killing a baby after birth is already against the law. Actively killing an infant born alive is a crime, said Lois Shepherd, a professor of law and biomedical ethics at the University of Virginia and author of the books Rationing Health Care at the End of Life and If That Ever Happens to Me: Making Life and Death Decisions After Terri Schiavo. Under the law, living infants are just like other living people. They are children. Children are people. Legal experts pointed to several specific laws relevant to newborns: • The Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act, first passed in 1974 and subsequently revised, including major updates in the 1980s. The relevant portion of the law makes certain types of federal funding for states conditional on their adoption of policies to prevent improper withholding of treatment from newborns, including those with disabilities. • The Born-Alive Infants Protection Act of 2002 established that federal legal protections that applied to persons also covered children born at any stage of development, including after an abortion. The law did not directly create civil or criminal penalties, however -- something the 2019 bill would have added. Filling that omission was a key motivator for supporters of the bill. The 2002 law is toothless and purely symbolic, said Dwight Duncan, a University of Massachusetts law professor who serves on the the boards of the Pro-Life Legal Defense Fund and Massachusetts Citizens for Life. • State laws. State, rather than federal, laws are the primary source of protection against active or negligent killing of infants born during the process of abortion, said Teresa S. Collett, a law professor at the University of St. Thomas and director of the universitys Prolife Center. In 2002, Collett said, Congress identified 30 states that had some statutory protection for infants surviving an attempted abortion. Most states would allow prosecution of doctors for killing or failing to resuscitate after a live birth, said Douglas O. Linder, an emeritus law professor at the University of Missouri-Kansas City. In fact, the highest-profile case of this type was prosecuted under state laws: The 2013 trial of Philadelphia abortion doctor Kermit Gosnell, who was sentenced to three life terms for killing a series of late-term newborns in gruesome fashion. Not to provide standard newborn care for those infants that happen to survive an abortion and emerge breathing could be considered a form of negligent killing or homicide, Duncan said. Part of the reason that tensions over abortion have been heightened this year is the consideration of bills in two states -- New York and Virginia -- to ease some of the state-level rules governing abortions, particularly late-term abortions. (We previously fact-checked a statement by Trump about the Virginia bill and another about the New York bill.) Critics of the Democratic position on the Senate bill say the redundancy argument is a fig leaf for political considerations. If Democrats agree with the overall principle, the argument goes, there is little harm in passing a law that reinforces existing statutes. Personally, I do not think it credible for Democrats to say they are against executing babies after birth if they are unwilling to provide criminal and civil penalties to abortion doctors that kill babies that survive abortions, nor provide equal standard of medical care for such babies, Duncan said. It is a largely rhetorical strategy to get out of an embarrassing position. There is a long tradition in Congress by both parties of putting forward bills that seek to force the other party into casting awkward votes. This law would fall into that category, said Mary Ziegler, a Florida State University law professor and author of the books Beyond Abortion: Roe v. Wade and the Fight for Privacy and After Roe: The Lost History of the Abortion Debate. The Senate bill mostly appealed to Republicans because it would put Democrats in a difficult political situation, Ziegler said. Polls show that most Americans are uncomfortable with later abortions, much less anything after a live birth. Focusing on this issue is strategically savvy, even if it would make very little difference to the overall number of abortions. On the other hand, experts agreed that Trumps use of the word executing grossly exaggerated the Democratic position. My impression is that the term execution is generally reserved for public application of the death penalty, Duncan said. Merriam-Websters definition of execution agrees. It says the word refers to a putting to death, especially as a legal penalty. Certainly the deaths envisioned by the recent bill arent carried out as a legal penalty. In reality, both sides agree that active killing of a breathing newborn is -- and should be -- illegal. There is a broad consensus that a child that takes its first breath has crossed a bright line from fetus to child and should be protected by the law, Collett said. This is a clear-cut concept that we can all agree upon, said Gretchen Ely, an associate professor at the University of Buffalos School of Social Work and a board member for Social Workers for Reproductive Justice. The notion that anyone supports executing infants after birth is preposterous. More complicated are cases in which the newborn is so severely disabled that they may not survive beyond a few days. Many abortions that occur later in pregnancy involve fetal anomalies incompatible with life, such as anencephaly, the absence of the brain and cranium above the base of the skull, or limb-body wall complex, when the organs develop outside of the body cavity, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists has written. A failure to resuscitate, which is typical in such cases, is a much more contentious issue, said Arthur Caplan, a bioethicist at New York University Langone Medical Center. Babies born post-abortion, spontaneous or induced, with horrible and potentially painful conditions incompatible with life, would not be routinely resuscitated or aggressively treated by most medical teams. In fact some would not even know how to try, or lack the technology to do so, especially in rural areas. Caplan said he is unaware of examples of medically active killing, and that while allowing to die does happen, it occurs very rarely—say, a baby born with no lungs at 20 weeks. In such a scenario, Trumps image of an execution is hyperbole, experts said. I do not have a clue what is meant by executing after birth, said Leslie Francis, director of the Center for Law and Biomedical Sciences at the University of Utah who also serves as a member of the ethics committee of the American Society for Reproductive Medicine and previously served as a director of the Disability Law Center. Trump said, The Democrat(ic) position on abortion is now so extreme that they dont mind executing babies AFTER birth. Theres little question that the vote on the Senate bill was uncomfortable for Democrats: They effectively voted against a bill whose principles they said they support, arguing that the bill would be redundant because those principles are already enshrined in law. However, Trump overreached when he described Democrats as tolerating executing newborns. No one supports actively killing newborns, much less executing them; the contested terrain concerns what efforts should be made to extend the lives of babies who are not expected to survive long with severe disabilities.",0,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,False

Final Rating: False  ","An Environmental Protection Agency regulation that goes into effect Jan. 1, 2012, regulates dust.","It was the kind of question that any politician who opposes big government would love to field during a GOP presidential debate.My question is, if you were forced to eliminate one department from the federal government, which one would you eliminate and why? asked a man from Arlington, Va., via YouTube during the Sept. 22 debate in Orlando.A moderator chose metro Atlantan Herman Cain to answer it, and to the delight of the audience, he turned his hypothetical ax on a favorite target of big government foes: the Environmental Protection Agency.Now, I know that makes some people nervous, but the EPA has gone wild. The fact that they have a regulation that goes into effect Jan. 1, 2012, to regulate dust says that they've gone too far, Cain replied.Dust? The EPA will start regulating dust in January?We contacted the Cain camp for evidence, but they didnt reply. Fortunately, the EPA posted its reports on the issue online. Factcheck.org, a fact-checking operation similar to PolitiFact, looked into Cains comment as well.We found that the EPA has long regulated a category of air pollution called particulate matter, which includes dust. Theres no new regulation scheduled for Jan. 1, 2012.Particle pollution is a floating mix of solid particles and liquid droplets. Sometimes, the particles are visible, like smoke from a power plant, haze, or the dust that Cain mentioned. Other times, theyre so small theyre invisible to the naked eye. These particulates can be made up of any number of chemicals, and can come from a variety of sources such as smokestacks, fires or construction sites.A growing body of scientific evidence links particle pollution to a variety of health problems, including respiratory issues, lung disease, heart problems and even higher death rates, according to multiple independent reviews of the scientific literature as well as the EPA.A small number of studies have even linked naturally occurring dust storms to a rise in trips to the emergency room for cardiovascular problems, according to an EPA review of scientific studies. The EPA has regulated this form of air pollution since 1971 under the Clean Air Act, and requires air monitors in areas with populations greater than 100,000, according to state and federal documents. But it does not specifically single out farm dust for regulation.Since states have to comply with the regulations or risk losing federal money, they may institute rules for farm dust to get into compliance with the law, a lobbyist for the farm industry and news accounts confirm. The Clean Air Act requires the EPA reviews its particle pollution standards every five years. And thats where the current dust-up over dust began.The EPA released its most recent policy assessment in April. It concludes that based on the newest research, its worthwhile to consider tightening some standards on larger or coarse particulates. This category includes dust from landfills, construction sites, agriculture and industrial sources such as steel mills.The agriculture industry and other groups objected, saying this suggestion doesnt make sense for rural areas, where tractors and pickups kick up naturally occurring dirt in the fields or on unpaved roads.But both the EPA and regulation opponents agree that no regulation is in the pipeline, and its certainly not coming Jan. 1.Factcheck.orgs Sept. 23 story on the debate noted that EPA Administrator Lisa Jackson testified before the U.S. House Committee on Agriculture in March that it was a mischaracterization that the EPA is trying to expand regulation of dust from farms.Indeed, the EPA has not formally submitted new regulations for review, an agency spokeswoman told PolitiFact Georgia. Jackson said she would make a decision on whether to tighten the rules in July, according to a Reuters news story, but she has yet to do so.Even if the EPA were to submit such regulations today, it could take a year or so for them to go into effect, said Richard Krause, a lobbyist for the American Farm Bureau Federation. The EPA would have to make any proposal available for public review and comment, a process that could take some months.So to sum up:The EPA has been regulating large particulate matter, including dust, for four decades, but does not single out farm dust or require monitoring in more rural areas.EPA staffers and scientists concluded after an assessment of the most recent science that its worthwhile to consider tightening current regulations, but the EPA has not formally proposed any regulation, and even if they did so today, it could take a while for it to go into effect.So, Cain does have a point. The EPA does regulate dust under the Clean Air Act. But Cains language was very specific, and now that the dust has settled in the wake of the Republican debate, its clear his specifics were incorrect.Dust is regulated, but not at all in the way that Cain described. We therefore rate his statement False.",0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,False

Final Rating: False  ",ACORN will be a paid partner with the Census Bureau and they will be in charge of going door-to-door and collecting data from the American public.,"Rep. Michele Bachmann sparked a new controversy recently when she declared she would provide the bare minimum to Census takers because she was concerned about the Census Bureau's partnership with ACORN, a left-leaning group that has become a popular villain for Republicans. (You remember ACORN: Formally known as the Association of Community Organization for Reform Now, it was lambasted in 2008 by many Republicans because its voter registration efforts included some fraudulent names such as Mickey Mouse. ACORN leaders said they discovered the fake names, notified authorities and fired some workers who cut corners. But Republican leaders still say it was a willful effort to manipulate the election to help the group's liberal agenda.) Here's how Bachmann explained her concerns in aWashington Timesinterview (which you can listen tohere): Now ACORN has been named one of the national partners, which will be a recipient again of federal money, Bachmann said. And they will be in charge of going door-to-door and collecting data from the American public. This is very concerning because the motherload of all data information will be from the Census. And, of course, we think of the Census as just counting how many people live in your home. Unfortunately, the Census data has become very intricate, very personal (with) a lot of the questions that are asked. And I know for my family the only question that we will be answering is how many people are in our home. We won't be answering any information beyond that, because the Constitution doesn't require any information beyond that. Bachmann packs a lot of bad information into a short space there. So in this item we'll deal with her latest claim about ACORN, and we'll deal with her claim about the constitutional requirement witha different item. She is wildly wrong with her chraracterization of the Census Bureau's partnership program. Yes, the bureaudoespartner with organizations to help recruit workers. To date, it has 30,000 such partners. ACORN is one. Partners agree to promote the 2010 Census among their constituents. As a partner, ACORN has agreed to spread the word among its people about the availability of temporary Census jobs. The U.S. Census Bureau expects to hire 1.4 million people through the course of the 2010 census, the bulk of them to do the door-to-door questionnaires, so the bureau casts a wide net to get applicants, including through its partners. Partners don't get paid, but they presumably benefit by getting the word out to members about jobs, and also by providing a public service emphasizing the importance of filling out the Census. According to Census Bureau information provided to Congress on June 1, 2009, ACORN and other partner organizations simply promote the availability of temporary Census jobs, but have no role in the terms or conditions of employment beyond promotion of the availability of temporary jobs. Applicants that are hired by the Census Bureau to work on the 2010 Census are required to go through a background check that includes an FBI name check and fingerprint check so that felons are not hired to work on the 2010 Census. Partners are also encouraged to donate testing space for the millions of people who will apply for the temporary Census jobs. No payments are made for that. And lastly, partners are asked to promote full participation in the Census among their members, through newsletters, e-mails, local meetings etc. Again, there's no payment for that. So let's count the ways Bachmann is wrong: ACORN will not be in charge of going door-to-door and collecting data from the American public, as Bachmann said. The U.S. Census will be in charge of that. Some of the 1.4 million people who get Census-taking jobs may learn about the job through ACORN. Workers who apply to the Census through ACORN have no better shot at the job than those who apply through any of the 30,000 other partners. That's it. And despite Bachmann's claim, ACORN gets no money for signing on as a partner. Once again, she is making a scaremongering claim about ACORN with facts that are ridiculously wrong. So we have to set the meter on fire once again. She earns another Pants on Fire.",0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,False

During the South Carolina debate Jan. 14, Rubio said that Christie endorsed many of the ideas that President Barack Obama supports, whether it is Common Core, or gun control, or the appointment of Sonia Sotomayor, or the donation he made to Planned Parenthood. Christie shot back, Lets get the facts straight. First of all, I didnt support Sonia Sotomayor. He then continued to dispute the rest of Rubios statement. We decided to focus on the part about the Supreme Court justice. Who is right? Did Christie support Sotomayor or not? Sotomayor Sotomayor, a U.S. Court of Appeals judge, was Obamas first Supreme Court nominee and the countrys first Hispanic justice. She was confirmed by the Senate on Aug. 6, 2009, in a 68-31 vote. The Rubio campaign did not respond to our inquiry about the claim, but we tracked down some of Christies statements through his campaign and news coverage. In 2009, Christie was running for governor in New Jersey, so he didnt get to vote on her appointment or play any role in her vetting by the Senate. But he did make a series of statements about her in 2009 that a Christie campaign spokeswoman sent to us. Its not surprising that Christie -- a former federal prosecutor -- was asked to weigh in about a Supreme Court candidate who was from New York and went to college at Princeton in New Jersey. In a radio debate May 27, 2009, Christie was asked: Would you have appointed her or even considered her for a top appointment to the bench? Christie responded, She wouldnt have been my choice, no. When asked to elaborate, Christie said, Well, no, I mean listen, thats the question. She wouldnt have been my choice. Absolutely not. Not my kind of judge.  But two months later, he made comments that showed some support for her confirmation -- although he again said that Sotomayor would not have been his choice. After watching and listening to Judge Sotomayor's performance at the confirmation hearings this week, I am confident that she is qualified for the position of associate justice of the U.S. Supreme Court, said Christie, a former federal prosecutor, according to Politicker New Jersey. Elections have consequences. One of those consequences are judicial appointments. While Judge Sotomayor would not have been my choice, President Obama has used his opportunity to fill a seat on the Supreme Court by choosing a nominee who has more than proven her capability, competence and ability. He continued: I support her appointment to the Supreme Court and urge the Senate to keep politics out of the process and confirm her nomination. Qualified appointees should be confirmed and deserve bipartisan support. Chief Justice Roberts and Justice Alito deserved that support based on their work as Circuit Court Judges. So does Judge Sotomayor. As a result, I support her confirmation. This is a historic moment and her inspiring success story should not only make the Latino community proud, but all Americans. Our ruling Christie said, I didnt support Sonia Sotomayor. When Sotomayor was nominated by Obama, Christie said in May 2009, She wouldnt have been my choice, no. But two months later, Christie said that she had more than proven her capability, competence and ability, adding, I support her appointment to the Supreme Court and urge the Senate to keep politics out of the process and confirm her nomination. Christies statement that he didnt support Sotomayor misrepresents his eventual position. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/ddcd5e6e-4c95-498f-9332-1d198ac3dad6",0.5,0.5,1,0.5,0,0.5,0.5,0,0.5,Half True

Final Rating: Mostly False",Accuses Ed FitzGerald of pay-to-play and corruption politics.,"Before officially declaring his candidacy for governor last week, Cuyahoga County Executive Ed FitzGerald spent months preparing for his run against Republican incumbent John Kasich. Kasichs allies have been preparing for FitzGerald nearly as long. There is little doubt FitzGerald will trade heavily on his experience as an FBI agent and his reputation for turning the page on a corrupt chapter of county government. But the GOP prefers to focus on FitzGeralds largely inconsequential mention as Public Official 14 in the indictment of Jimmy Dimora, the county commissioner later convicted on racketeering and other charges. Consider how the Republican Governors Association (RGA) welcomed FitzGerald to the race. After failing to recruit a more experienced candidate, Democrats are now stuck with Ed FitzGeralds brand of pay-to-play and corruption politics, said Executive Director Phil Cox. PolitiFact Ohio decided this was a good time to reexamine FitzGeralds tangential connections to the widespread federal investigation of county corruption. The RGA statement was not the first -- nor will it be the last -- reference to the case. The Ohio Republican Party has launched a web site -- www.publicofficial14.com-- to blast FitzGerald, known in GOP shorthand as P.O. 14. But how fair and truthful are these tactics? The Plain Dealer wrote extensively in 2010 about FitzGeralds bit role in the Dimora investigation. FitzGerald at the time was the mayor of Lakewood and the Democratic nominee for the powerful new position of county executive. Federal prosecutors charged Dimora a week after FitzGerald won the primary. They described a Lakewood deal for which Dimora had been bribed. On March 6, 2008, Dimora called FitzGerald on behalf of developer William Neiheiser, who was interested in leasing Lakewoods ice rink. Neiheiser had been having trouble reaching the mayor. Neiheiser wants to make a proposal to you ... that he thinks will be advantageous to the city and to you if you wanted to talk to him, Dimora told FitzGerald, according to a wiretap transcript. FitzGerald replied: Ill make the time  Ill make time to talk to him. Dimora added: If theres anything we can do, uh, let us know . any help we can provide. Neiheiser pleaded guilty to charges that he bribed Dimora with free home improvements and other gifts in exchange for favors involving the ice rink and other public contracts. Essentially Dimora, then the chairman of the Cuyahoga County Democratic Party, flaunted his ability to get lower-level party leaders on the telephone when a patron such as Neiheiser was in need. Prosecutors did not accuse FitzGerald of wrongdoing in the Dimora indictment, let alone charge him or even identify him by name. But as The Plain Dealer found, Neiheiser contributed $250 to FitzGeralds political campaign the following month. And in June 2008, the Lakewood City Council unanimously agreed at FitzGeralds urging to lease the ice rink to a Neiheiser company. FitzGerald and those who served on the Lakewood council at the time defended the deal as a smart financial move for the city. The lease called for Neiheisers company to operate the rink and pay the city about $75,000 a year in rent. Neiheisers attorney told The Plain Dealer in 2010 that his client had spent more than $2 million to refurbish the city-owned complex. Matt Dolan, the Republican nominee for county executive in 2010, raised questions about FitzGeralds involvement in the Dimora deal and branded his opponent as Public Official 14. FitzGerald rid his war chest of contributions from Dimora, Neiheiser and others caught up in the investigation by making a charitable donation. And after beating Dolan and taking office as county executive he rid the county payroll of many patronage hires loyal to Dimoras political machine. But in January, FitzGeralds name again surfaced in a case, this time at a trial for another crooked contractor, Michael Forlani. An FBI agent testified that Forlani used two intermediaries in 2008 to disguise his campaign contributions to the then-mayor. FitzGerald told The Plain Dealer at the time that the agents testimony was the first he had heard of the donations. Then came an extraordinary announcement from Ann Rowland, the lead prosecutor in the corruption case. In a statement U.S. attorneys rarely make, Rowland cleared FitzGerald. Ed FitzGerald is not a target of the investigation, Rowland said. We have no evidence Ed FitzGerald knew Michael Forlani had anything to do with these contributions. After seeing Coxs statement last week on FitzGerald, PolitiFact Ohio asked RGA spokesman Jon Thompson to specify what the group meant by FitzGeralds brand of pay-to-play and corruption politics. Thompson specified the Public Official 14 designation. Thompson also noted that the Ohio GOP has tied FitzGerald to the corruption probe. And he shared a link to the conservative Third Base Politics blog, which reported that the left-leaning Plunderbund blog had deleted posts from 2010 that presented FitzGerald as Public Official 14. So, lets review. Cox accused FitzGerald of perpetuating a brand of pay-to-play and corruption politics. More than 60 other public officials, government employees and contractors have been convicted of charges stemming from the federal investigation. But the agents and prosecutors who tore up county government never accused FitzGerald of a crime. And though FitzGerald has surfaced a couple of times in the investigation, the lead prosecutor has said he is not under suspicion. The brand in question is one Republicans no doubt prefer as they gear up for Kasichs re-election battle. But they have no proof that FitzGerald engaged in corrupt politics. And they misleadingly hide behind the cryptic and nuanced Public Official 14 designation while ignoring the much more direct and meaningful exculpatory statement from the lead prosecutor. They also ignore the work FitzGerald has done to clean up after the corrupt regime that preceded him. Facts lay waste to any effort like this one that explicitly brands FitzGerald as a corrupt politician. Pants On Fire!",0,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,Mostly False

Mukwege did resign, but it wasnt for those reasons. Mukwege is a Congolese gynecologist and surgeon who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2018 along with Nadia Murad for their work to end the use of sexual violence as a weapon of war. The post displays a photo of Mukwege and claims he said this about resigning from the team: I cannot in any case dirty my Nobel Peace Prize for money, we had been ordered to declare any illness to be coronavirus and any death. In addition, the thing that displeased me is that, after more than 100 samples none came out positive. I have a career to protect and I am Congolese by blood. Getting rich by lying is a sin before God, I quit. The quote is fake. Mukwege said he resigned because of problems that included inadequate preventive measures and inefficient testing. The post was flagged as part of Facebooks efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Mukwege served as vice chairman of the Multi-sectoral Coronavirus Response Committee and president of the Health Commission, which were established in Congos South Kivu province to handle its COVID-19 pandemic response. Mukwege released a statement about his decision to resign from the committee on June 10 on the website for the Panzi Foundation, a charitable organization he founded. He said the decision was due to slow testing, problems implementing a response strategy and inadequate preventative measures. We are therefore at the start of an exponential epidemiological curve and we can no longer apply a strategy that would only be preventive, Mukwege wrote. I therefore decided to resign from my duties as Vice-President of the Multi-sectoral Coronavirus Response Committee in our province and President of the Health Commission, in order to devote myself entirely to my medical responsibilities and to treat this influx of patients at Panzi Hospital. A Panzi Foundation spokesperson also confirmed to PolitiFact that the quote is fabricated.

Final Rating: Half True",Elijah Cummings house was broken into after Trump publicly attacked him on Twitter.,"President Donald Trump might have stirred some confusion when he tweeted days after the fact about an attempted break-in at Rep. Elijah Cummings Baltimore home. Really bad news! The Baltimore house of Elijah Cummings was robbed, Trump wrote. Too bad!  Really bad news! The Baltimore house of Elijah Cummings was robbed. Too bad! Without more context, Trumps tweet made the incident seem like breaking news. That could explain why some people have been pinning blame on the president, who spent the week attacking Cummings on Twitter over the condition of his Maryland district. Elijah Cummings house was broken into after Trump publicly attacked him on Twitter and Republicans say nothing, comedian Chelsea Handler said in an Aug. 2 tweet thats amassed thousands of likes and retweets. Our president bullies someone and then has an intruder in his home, Handler wrote. The president of the United States. The lows keep coming.  Elijah Cummings house was broken into after Trump publicly attacked him on twitter and Republicans say nothing. Our president bullies someone and then has an intruder in his home. The president of the United States. The lows keep coming. We saw other similar reactions, but thats not what happened. According to Baltimore police, the attempted burglary took place roughly four hours before Trumps initial tweet-storm. Cummings described the incident, which occurred early in the morning on July 27, in a statement to the Baltimore Sun. An individual attempted to gain entry into my residence at approximately 3:40 a.m. on Saturday, July 27, he said. I was notified of the intrusion by my security system, and I scared the intruder away by yelling before the person gained entry into the residential portion of the house. Cummings account matches what the Baltimore police department said in a statement and wrote in a police report, a copy of which we received. The police report said no property was reported stolen, meaning Trumps tweet that Cummings house was robbed was inaccurate. More to the point, Trumps initial Twitter attacks — in which he called Cummings a brutal bully and described the congressmans district as a disgusting, rat and rodent infested mess — also began on July 27. But the time-stamp for the presidents first tweet is 7:14 a.m.  Rep, Elijah Cummings has been a brutal bully, shouting and screaming at the great men & women of Border Patrol about conditions at the Southern Border, when actually his Baltimore district is FAR WORSE and more dangerous. His district is considered the Worst in the USA...... As of Aug. 2, police are still investigating the incident and it is not known if the break-in was politically motivated. Handler said, Elijah Cummings house was broken into after Trump publicly attacked him on Twitter. An intruder did attempt to enter Cummings home, but that was almost four hours before Trump tweeted the first of several attacks on the congressman and his district.",0.5,0.6,1.0,0.5,0.3,0.4,0.5,0.3,0.4,Half True

Final Rating: False  ","It was (Rob Portmans) job to stop Chinas illegal dumping of steel. He failed, looked the other way, did nothing."," Ted Strickland goes back 11 years in an ad targeting incumbent Ohio Sen. Rob Portman, chastising his role as U.S. trade representative under President George W. Bush. It was his job to stop Chinas illegal dumping of steel, the narrator says. He failed, looked the other way, did nothing. Titled Beltway Rob, the ad is part of an ongoing name-calling battle between the Strickland and Portman campaigns. (Portman mocks Strickland as Retread Ted.) Stricklands ad left us wondering if Portman dropped the ball on foreign steel during his year as trade representative. (Dumping in trade speak typically refers to a country introducing a cheaper-than-normal product into a foreign market and edging out domestic manufacturers.) Was it really his job to stop Chinas illegal steel dumping, and did Portman really do nothing to stand up for the United States? Stricklands campaign pointed us to a 2012 Politico article about potential running mates for Mitt Romneys presidential bid. Portmans name was on the short list, the article said, but a chapter in Portmans trade history could be leveraged as a weakness by Democratic opponents. We turned to the trade wonks for more clarity. Role of trade representative So was it Portmans job to stop China's illegal dumping of steel?  In a word, no. Like a lot of political ads, its more complicated than the ad is saying, said Warren Maruyama, who served as general counsel for the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative under Portmans successor, Susan Schwab. The trade representatives job is to act as the governments spokesperson on trade, negotiate trade agreements, file cases with the World Trade Organization on behalf of domestic interests and defend against cases where those interests are challenged, and to oversee coordination with the alphabet soup of other agencies whose interests overlap with trade, Maruyama said. Trade law is arcane, and its easier to yell China bad! than it is to explain its nuances. But to a trade experts ear, it makes no sense to say that Portman failed to stop illegal Chinese dumping. Its like saying LeBron James failed to score any touchdowns last season — that's thewrong sport. Likewise, the law is very clear that the U.S. trade representative has no role in the determinations on unfair trade practices such as dumping. Determinations regarding dumping are made by the Commerce Department and the U.S. International Trade Court, in procedures which are deliberately shielded from political or outside interference. Its walled off from political considerations, and Portman could have gotten into trouble if hed tried to interfere, Maruyama said.  If dumping is proven, its an unfair trade practice for which relief is mandatory. The U.S. International Trade Commission decides if there is injury or the threat of injury, and the Commerce Department determines the appropriate relief, through higher tariffs. Alan Wolff, who was deputy special representative for trade negotiations during President Jimmy Carters administration, agreed. Portman had no role on anti-dumping, he said. Thats flat-out wrong. The attack ad copy is conflating two different issues, Wolff said. The case referenced by Politico, the one that the Strickland ad wants to use as proof of Portmans inaction on Chinese dumping, didnt involve market-dumping at all. The case at hand is different In August 2005, American makers of circular welded non-alloy steel pipe, which is often used in home-building, filed for relief from market disruption under Section 421 of the Trade Act of 1974. Market disruption is not the same as dumping. Trade experts draw a firm distinction between the two terms.(When theWall Street Journalmischaracterized a similar 2009 market disruption case as a dumping case, the paper rana correction.) There is a clear difference, Maruyama said. The thing about dumping is it sounds bad, so people throw it around, but its just not accurate. Section 421 is a unique and rarely used statute, according to Schwab, who took over for Portman after Bush tapped him to head the U.S. Office of Management and Budget. Cases under this statute for market disruptionfall under a category of safeguard considerations, where it is not necessary for the petitioner to prove wrongdoing, only that a trade action has caused them injury, or threat of injury. Its a way of bypassing a formal dumping hearing by the trade commission, Schwab said. Section 421 cases are also unique in that they require approval from the White House. The president, the law says, must determine whether trade relief measures are in the countrys economic interest, or could threaten national security. In October 2005, the International Trade Commission issued its determination on the steel pipe case. Four of six trade commissioners sided with the steel pipe manufacturers and recommended tariffs and safeguard actions be imposed on Chinas pipe imports. Two commissioners dissented, finding no market disruption. Here, it was Portmans job to coordinate the process where representatives from other agencies weigh in. They all sit down and argue, Maruyama said, and if they have a consensus, thats the recommendation that goes up to the president. If there are differences, and often there are, it goes over to the White House in a memo summarizing all the pros and cons. And then Bush gets to decide.  Portman had a Cabinet role in this occasion, but Schwab said Bush was very clear that there was only one decider in his administration. It wasnt a Portman-Bush decision, she said. It was a Bush decision. Bush did not impose relief in this case, or in three other 421 cases that crossed his desk when Portman wasnt his trade representative. In the steel pipe case, Bush said that relief wasnt in the national economic interest. He believed that punishing China on steel pipe wouldnt ultimately help U.S. steel manufacturers. There are many other countries currently supplying standard pipe to the U.S. market that could fill the void created by curtailed Chinese imports, wrotePortman in a February 2006 letterto Sen. Blanche Lincoln, D-Ark., one of many lawmakers catching heat from angry steel industry constituents. Schwab called attacks on Portmans record on China ironic. Portman was always my strongest ally when I wanted to take the Chinese to the WTO, she said. He was a hawk on these issues. If I wanted to file trade enforcement cases on China I could always count on him. Our ruling Stricklands ad says that it was Portmans job to stop Chinas illegal dumping of steel. He failed, looked the other way, did nothing. We consulted trade experts on both sides of the partisan aisle. They were unanimous that the ads statement is fundamentally wrong.Portman did not have a role to play in anti-dumping measures as U.S. trade representative. The 2005 trade matter that the ad attacks him over had nothing to do with dumping. This case only reached Portman, and ultimately Bush, because it was filed underanother part of trade law that triggers presidential involvement that isn't used for true dumping cases. Andif you switched Bush for Portman in this ad, it would still be a cynical twisting of words. Dumping is not a catch-all for Chinese steelinthe market.",0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,False

Comey, who Trump removed as FBI director in 2017, made detailed notes following seven encounters with Trump. Comey had testified before Congress about portions of the memos, but they became public in their entirety for the first time on April 19, which prompted Trump to claim the memos cleared his name. James Comey Memos just out and show clearly that there was NO COLLUSION and NO OBSTRUCTION, Trump tweeted.  James Comey Memos just out and show clearly that there was NO COLLUSION and NO OBSTRUCTION. Also, he leaked classified information. WOW! Will the Witch Hunt continue? Comey has said he made written records of his meetings with Trump in part due to concerns the president might lie about their discussions. Here, Trumps tweetbadly mischaracterizes their contents. Nowhere in Comeys memos does he say that Trump did not collude or obstruct justice. Lets recap how the memos came to be. In July 2016, when Comey was still FBI director, the FBI opened a counterintelligence investigation into links between the Trump campaign and the Russian government. After Trump was elected, Comey made contemporaneous notes of seven discussions he had with Trump. On May 9, 2017, Trump fired Comey as FBI director. From this point forward, Comey would have no role investigating Trump campaign ties to Russia. Later that month, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein appointed former FBI Director Robert Mueller as special counsel. Mueller was authorized to lead the investigation into possible connections between the Trump campaign and Russian officials, as well as other matters that may arise directly from the investigation. (Rosenstein was acting as attorney general in place of Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who recused himself from the investigation.) Heres the key point: After the reins were passed from Comey to Mueller, the investigation into contacts between the Trump campaign and Russia escalated dramatically. Comey wasnt in any position to make definitive statements about whether collusion existed or not. To date, Muellers investigation has swept up four members of Trumps campaign, including three who have agreed to work with Muellers team as part of a plea deal. Muellers probe is ongoing, and he has yet to issue a final determination on the collusion question. The idea that the memos exonerate Trump on charges of obstruction of justice is even weaker. For starters, Comeys memos contain details that many experts would consider legally relevant in an obstruction case against Trump. The memos describe a one-on-one dinner with Trump on Jan. 27, 2017, at the White House, where Trump turned the conversation to whether Comey wanted to stay on as FBI director. Comey has said he suspected Trump was seeking a patronage relationship with him. Comeys memo goes on to state that Trump explicitly requested his loyalty later that evening, saying, I need loyalty, I expect loyalty. The memos also describe a private meeting at the White House the following month, in which Trump asked Comey to drop the investigation into former national security adviser Michael Flynn, saying, I hope you can see your way clear to letting this go. Finally, two days after Comeys ouster, Trump said in a nationally televised interview that hed been thinking about the FBIs Russia investigation when he fired Comey. When I decided to just do it, I said to myself, I said you know, this Russia thing with Trump and Russia is a made-up story, Trump told NBCs Lester Holt. As in the case of the collusion question, Mueller has yet to issue a final determination on whether Trump obstructed justice. Even when the Comey memos are read in a light most favorable to Trump, they still dont support his claim that the writings exonerate him. Comeys memos show Trump repeatedly asking for his help to lift the cloud being cast over his presidency by the Russia probe. Comey writes that he reassured Trump multiple times that the FBI was not investigating him. But Comeys final memo was written more than a year ago, before Mueller ramped up the investigation and before Trump admitted he had been thinking about the Russia investigation when he fired Comey. More recently, Comey addressed the investigation in his memoir A Higher Loyalty, where he holds open the possibility of criminal wrongdoing: One of the pivotal questions I presume that Bob Muellers team is investigating is whether or not in urging me to back the FBI off our investigation of his national security adviser and in firing me, President Trump was attempting to obstruct justice, which is a federal crime. Its certainly possible. There is at least circumstantial evidence in that regard, and there may be more that the Mueller team will assemble. Trump said the Comey memos show clearly that there was no collusion and no obstruction of justice. Nowhere in Comeys memos does he say that Trump did not collude nor obstruct justice. And in the year since Comey penned his last Trump memo, a special counsel has been appointed who has escalated the investigation. That investigation has resulted in other charges against four members of Trumps campaign, including three who have agreed to plea deals. In his book, Comey writes that thememosand the circumstances of his firingmay be legally relevant to an obstruction case against Trump. Comey has also held open the possibility that Trump may ultimately be found to have committed criminal wrongdoing. ",0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,False

Such is the case for a decade-old email chain that warns against giving children a combination of Motrin and Robitussin, because they may have a heart attack. One example of the claim, which has been popping up in email inboxes since at least 2008, has gotten over 115,000 shares on Facebook and says that an 8-year-old girl named Madison passed away after she was allegedly given both medications: This was sent to us from a nurse in our district  thought Id pass along just as an FYI. Motrin and Robitussin dont mix!!! Madison, age 8, passed away just a few days ago. Weve been asked to pass this on. Doctors told her family that there have been quite a few children Madisons age that have died recently the same way that she did. The only common link between them was that they were given Motrin (ibuprofen) and Robitussin together, this caused a heart attack. They believe this is what happened to them. They told her to alert everyone to this. Do not give children both of these medicines together. You can give them one or the other but not both. When Madison collapsed she suffered a heart attack and they were able to revive her but the loss of oxygen damaged her brain and she was put on the respirator. After this she had four strokes before she died after being taken off the respirator. Please pass this on !!!!!!!!! The bottom of the post has the email signature: Lisa Lopez M.A. Childrens Medical Center of Dallas Pulmonary Clinic. The post was flagged as part of Facebooks efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) This rumor is just that –– a rumor. There is no evidence to suggest that a Motrin-Robitussin combination causes heart attacks in otherwise healthy children. The Childrens Medical Center in Dallas, Texas, that appeared in the email signature came out to dispel the rumor in 2010, roughly a year after it started being shared. The hospitals announcement said the following: In 2009, a Childrens employee received the e-mail from a friend and inadvertently forwarded it from a work account. Because the employees professional signature was included at the bottom of the e-mail, the information appeared to come from a reliable source at Childrens Medical Center. This is not the case. All medications have side effects, the hospital noted, and parents of children with underlying medical conditions must always be vigilant about the medications their child is taking. The hospital statement advised parents to consult with their childrens doctor or a pharmacist before mixing any over-the-counter drugs. The Childrens Medical Center also addressed the rumor in a tweet on Dec. 22, 2014: Facebook post about Motrin & Robitussin is not correct & was not posted by one of our employees. The tweet linked to a 2009 fact-check by Snopes on the topic. Its important to note that the Food and Drug Administration does not recommend children under the age of two be given cough-cold medications. But the agency has not issued any warnings that the ingredients in Motrin (which contains ibuprofen) or Robitussin (which contains dextromethorphan and/or pseudoephedrine or sometimes chlorpheniramine) could cause heart attacks in children when combined. These ingredients are also in many other medications on the market, yet the chain email only singles out Motrin and Robitussin. If the danger of heart attacks, strokes or death was prevalent in the combination of two commonly used medications, health officials would have issued widespread public health warnings. Motrin alone is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug, and according to the FDA, the labels of over-the-counter versions warn that for adults and children (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs), except aspirin, increase the risk of heart attack, heart failure, and stroke. These can be fatal. The risk is higher if you use more than directed or for longer than directed. Ashley Turney, an FDA spokesperson for over-the-counter drugs, told PolitiFact that use of Robitussin products, with or without Motrin, is not associated with heart attacks. She described Robitussin as an umbrella brand containing a series of childrens cough and cold products that may contain a single ingredient or combinations of dextromethorphan hydrobromide, guaifenesin, phenylephrine hydrochloride, or chlorpheniramine maleate. The recommended use, dosing, and warnings vary amongst the seven Robitussin products that are intended for use in children over 4 or 6 years, she said. Turney noted that its important for people to read the drug facts label directions for all over-the-counter medications. An old rumor claims combining Motrin and Robitussin can cause heart attacks in children. There is no evidence that giving both of these medications to children causes heart attacks. Children who are too young or have underlying medical conditions can experience adverse side effects from taking any combination of over-the-counter medicine, health officials say. Parents are recommended to talk with their childs health care provider, or a pharmacist, if they have any questions about mixing medications. This rumor is False.",0,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,False

Final Rating: False  ","Rep. David Cicilline is responsible for the federal loan guarantee to Solyndra, the failed solar company","Theres been a lot of finger-pointing lately in Washington over the Obama administrations 2009 decision to give a $535-million federal loan guarantee to Solyndra, a now-defunct solar power manufacturer.The Republican-controlled House has launched an investigation into how the Department of Energy could guarantee such a large loan to a company that would file for bankruptcy only two and a half years later. What sort of examination of the California start-up companys finances did the government do before taking such a big risk?According to a news release we received the other day, the National Republican Congressional Committee has found a scapegoat for the debacle: U.S. Rep. David N. Cicilline, Democrat of Rhode Island.Once the poster child for David Cicilline's stimulus boondoggle, the bankrupt Solyndra company is now a symbol of how his failed scheme wasted taxpayer money on political payback and failing companies instead of creating the jobs promised, the Jan. 13 release said.The NRCC sent out the release in response to a Washington Times report that senior Solyndra executives were set to receive bonuses despite the companys troubles.Its outrageous enough that David Cicilline supported a $1-trillion failed stimulus package, but its even more outrageous that hundreds of millions were spent to fund a failing company like Solyndra, NRCC communications director Paul Lindsay went on to say in the release. Not only is Cicilline responsible for this irresponsible investment, but hell also have to explain to his Rhode Island constituents why Solyndras senior employees are receiving bonuses at the expense of hard-working American taxpayers.Weve heard a lot of allegations in connection to Solyndras problems, but never one laying the blame at Cicillines doorstep. This puzzled us because Cicilline took office in 2011, well after the federal stimulus package that financed Solyndras loan guarantee was passed and well after the decision was made to award Solyndra the loan guarantee. How could he be responsible?We checked the NRCCs website and saw that the same news release had been sent out to 49 other Congressional districts, but each time, the name of the Democrat in office was inserted where Cicillines name was. (The Democrats included Rep. Bill Keating, of Massachusetts, who also took office in 2011).We then called the organization seeking an explanation of how Cicilline made it on the list. (Curiously, Rep. James R. Langevin, Rhode Islands other congressman who is also a Democrat, wasnit on the list even though he was in office at the time the stimulus bill was passed and voted for it.)An NRCC spokesman said the release was accurate because Cicilline voiced support for the stimulus package when he was campaigning for Congress.I think the important thing to note is we didnt say Cicilline voted for the stimulus, Nat Sillin said. We say he supported it.Its true that Cicilline did back the stimulus package. When he was mayor of Providence, he was quoted numerous times saying that the bill would create sorely needed jobs.And although its technically true that the release didnt say that Cicilline voted for the stimulus, it did say that hes responsible. That didnt add up to us. Lets run through some dates to make it clear why:Feb. 13, 2009: Congress passes the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. Under the $787-billion stimulus package, Solyndra received its loan guarantee.March 20, 2009: Solyndra receives conditional approval for the loan guarantee, according to a timeline from the Department of Energ,.Sept. 3, 2009: The Department of Energy makes the final decision to approve the loan guarantee for Solyndra.Nov. 2, 2010: Cicilline elected to Congress.Jan. 5, 2011: Cicilline takes office.Our rulingThe full name of the legislation under which the stimulus package was approved gives this one away -- the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009.Cicilline took office in January 2011, a full 23 months after passage of the bill enacting the loan guarantee program that benefited Solyndra.The National Republican Congressional Committee has every right to call the stimulus a boondoggle. And its fair to say that Cicilline supported the stimulus before taking office.But Lindsay said that Cicilline is responsible for this irresponsible investment. No, hes not.Wed say that Lindsay and the National Republican Congressional Committee simply used overheated rhetoric, but thats an understatement. Their claim is so wildly inaccurate that we give it a Pants on Fire. (Get updates from PolitiFactRI on Twitter.

Final Rating: False  ",Accuses President Barack Obama of making contradictory claims about efforts to kill Osama bin Laden in 2008 and 2011.,"A reader recently forwarded us a chain e-mail thats been making the rounds, accusing President Barack Obama of hypocrisy over the raid that resulted in the killing of al-Qaida leader Osama bin Laden on May 1, 2011. A Google search also indicated that the text of the e-mail has been popping up widely in blogs and comment threads. Heres the full text of the version we received:Here are the facts, you be the judge. These words were spoken by the same man in 2008 and then again in 2011.Short and sweetOBAMA'S OWN WORDS TRAP HIM: 2008: Navy Seal Team 6 is Cheney's private assassination team.2011: I put together Seal Team 6 to take out Bin Laden.2008: Bin Laden is innocent until proven guilty, and must be captured alive and given a fair trial.2011: I authorized Seal Team 6 to kill Bin Laden.2008: Guantanamo is entirely unnecessary, and the detainees should not be interrogated.2011: Vital intelligence was obtained from Guantanamo detainees that led to our locating Bin Laden.I HOPE THIS GETS SENT AROUND TO PEOPLE WHO CARE ABOUT THE TRUTH!We thought wed look into whether the quotations in the e-mail were accurate. We did extensive searches on Google, in the Lexis-Nexis news database and the White Houses own website, as well as checking with a few experts. The White House did not respond to our query.While its impossible to prove a negative, we found no evidence to support the notion that Obama said any of these things. In fact, several of the statements are directly contradicted by the evidence we found.Well take the quotes one by one.2008: Navy Seal Team 6 is Cheney's private assassination team.We found occasional references in the media to assassination teams that were answerable to Vice President Dick Cheney, but no evidence that Obama ever said anything of the sort.In a March 11, 2009, speech at the University of Minnesota, veteran investigative reporter Seymour Hersh referred to the Joint Special Operations Command -- a special wing of our special operations community that is set up independently, as he put it. They do not report to anybody, except in the Bush-Cheney days, they reported directly to the Cheney office. ... Congress has no oversight of it. Its an executive assassination ring essentially....Later, during the July 15, 2009, edition of Countdown with Keith Olbermann -- a now-defunct nightly show on MSNBC -- the liberal host introduced a segment by saying that it was time to look at what we know about the Bush-Cheney assassination teams. The segment addressed purported assassination efforts under both the CIA and the Pentagon. The latter sent killing teams into the field, where they actually killed people, including those affiliated with al-Qaida, Olbermann said.Almost two years later, such comments became somewhat prescient, when details of the bin Laden raid became known. The counter-terrorist team that carried out the raid was the Naval Special Warfare Development Group, or DevGru for short. (The team is popularly, though incorrectly, known by one of its several former names, SEAL Team Six.) DevGru has been around since the early 1980s, usually shrouded in secrecy given its sensitive work. According to globalsecurity.org, it is a component of the Joint Special Operations Command.From whats been reported, its unclear whether DevGru truly was answerable to Cheney during his two terms as vice president. But the group existed, and the bin Laden raid certainly suggests that it has the ability -- at least in some cases -- to act as an assassination team.Still, the e-mail is wrong to suggest that Obama ever said or wrote that Navy Seal Team 6 is Cheney's private assassination team before he became president (or, for that matter, after).2011: I put together Seal Team 6 to take out Bin Laden.During his May 1, 2011, announcement of bin Ladens death, Obama detailed his role in ordering the bin Laden raid. But he never claimed that he had created the unit that carried out the raid (which he didnt, in any case).Obama said in his announcement that shortly after he took office, I directed Leon Panetta, the director of the CIA, to make the killing or capture of bin Laden the top priority of our war against al-Qaida, even as we continued our broader efforts to disrupt, dismantle, and defeat his network.  Last week, I determined that we had enough intelligence to take action, and authorized an operation to get Osama bin Laden and bring him to justice.Today, at my direction, the United States launched a targeted operation against that compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan. A small team of Americans carried out the operation with extraordinary courage and capability. No Americans were harmed. They took care to avoid civilian casualties. After a firefight, they killed Osama bin Laden and took custody of his body.In a lengthy interview conducted on May 4, 2011, Obama sounded a similar note.Obviously we have extraordinary guys, Obama told Steve Kroft of the CBS newsmagazine 60 Minutes. Our Special Forces are the best of the best. And so I was not involved in designing the initial plan. But each iteration of that plan they'd bring back to me. Make a full presentation. We would ask questions. We had multiple meetings in the Situation Room in which we would map out -- and we would actually have a model of the compound and discuss how this operation might proceed, and what various options there were because there was more than one way in which we might go about this.We did not find any evidence that Obama had claimed to have created the special forces team that carried out the raid.2008: Bin Laden is innocent until proven guilty and must be captured alive and given a fair trial.Obama never said this. In fact, he took the opposite stance in one of the presidential debates in 2008.If we have Osama bin Laden in our sights and the Pakistani government is unable or unwilling to take them out, then I think that we have to act, and we will take them out, Obama said. We will kill bin Laden. We will crush al-Qaida. That has to be our biggest national security priority.The closest we could find was a comment -- quickly retracted -- that was made in 2003 by Howard Dean. Dean, the former governor of Vermont, was running for the Democratic presidential nomination at the time.In December 2003, Dean told the Concord Monitor that he had resisted pronouncing a sentence (on bin Laden) before guilt is found. I still have this old-fashioned notion that even with people like Osama, who is very likely to be found guilty, we should do our best not to, in positions of executive power, not to prejudge jury trials.After a flurry of condemnations, Dean reversed course just a few hours later. He told the Associated Press that, as an American, I want to make sure he gets the death penalty he deserves. He also issued a statement that said in part, Bin Laden has admitted that he is responsible for killing 3,000 Americans as well as scores of men, women and children around the world. This is exactly the kind of case that the death penalty is meant for.2011: I authorized Seal Team 6 to kill Bin Laden.Obama didnt use the phrasing cited in the chain e-mail, but as we indicated earlier, theres no question that he took responsibility for ordering the raid.There is evidence that U.S. forces would have accepted a surrender by bin Laden, rather than killing him, under certain circumstances. After the raid, according to ABC News, State Department legal adviser Harold Koh wrote in a blog post that forces were prepared to capture bin Laden if he had surrendered in a way that they could safely accept in accordance with the laws of armed conflict which require the acceptance of a genuine offer of surrender, clearly communicated by the surrendering party under circumstances where it would be feasible for the forces to accept the offer of surrender.Still, Koh wrote that bin Laden was a lawful target under the Authorization for Use of Military Force passed by Congress in 2001. It allows military force against those that have planned, authorized, committed or aided the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001.2008: Guantanamo is entirely unnecessary, and the detainees should not be interrogated.This statement has a grain of truth, but it is exaggerated.During the campaign, Obama made no secret of his disagreement with elements of the Bush Administrations national security policy. He promised to close the detention facility at Guantanamo (which we have rated a Promise Broken) and to end the use of torture without exception (which we have rated In the Works).Obamas desire to close Guantanamo could be construed as him believing that the facility is entirely unnecessary, but its wrong to say that he believed that detainees shouldnt be interrogated. Interrogation is a standard procedure in law enforcement and intelligence. Obama wanted to end the use of torture.We also found no evidence that Obama uttered these words.2011: Vital intelligence was obtained from Guantanamo detainees that led to our locating Bin Laden.Some, including Cheney, have suggested that the Bin Laden raid benefited from intelligence gained through interrogation techniques that Obama has criticized as torture. This question has not been definitively settled, although the White House downplayed the possibility.Reporting from detainees was just a slice of the information that has been gathered by incredibly diligent professionals over the years in the intelligence community, White House spokesman Jay Carney said on May 3, 2011. And it simply strains credulity to suggest that a piece of information that may or may not have been gathered in -- eight years ago somehow directly led to a successful mission on Sunday. That's just not the case.John Pike, the director of globalsecurity.org, said that the words attributed to Obama on Guantanamo are ludicrous. It is not something he would have said, and there is no evidence that it is something that he did say.And in this case too, we found no evidence that Obama uttered the words attributed to him. As you may know I have been critical of Obama's national security policies, said Professor Jeff Addicott, director of the Center for Terrorism Law at St. Mary's University School of Law. That said, I have never heard him make the 2008 remarks, and I follow him very closely.Our ruling A few of the sentiments have some link to reality – Obama did order the raid to kill bin Laden, and he did oppose Guantanamo, even though he ultimately failed to carry through on his promise to close it. The critics may have wished Obama had made these statements, but appears the statements have no basis in reality. It's clear from our research that all six quotes are fabrications. Once again a widely circulated chain e-mail is spreading ridiculous falsehoods about Obama.",0,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,False

Final Rating: Mostly False  ","In the United States, 50 percent of social services are provided by the Catholic church.","Former Oklahoma Gov. Frank Keating, a Republican, appeared on NBCs Meet the Press just days after the selection of Cardinal Jorge Mario Bergoglio of Argentina to be the new pope. In praising Pope Francis life of humility, Keating said that judging by his selection, the church was poised to focus on caring for the poor and vulnerable. In his remarks, Keating offered a statistic to demonstrate the depth of the churchs commitment to charity. In the United States, 50 percent of social services are provided by the Catholic church, said Keating, who now serves as president and CEO of the American Bankers Association. Keating did not return an inquiry for this story, nor did Catholic Charities USA, the largest charitable organization run by the Catholic church. We asked a variety of experts on philanthropy whether they had heard this statistic or knew where it came from, but none did. We should start by noting that Catholic charity work is extensive and widely considered a crucial part of the nations social safety net. By itself, Catholic Charities USA, has more than 2,500 local agencies that serve 10 million people annually, said Mary L. Gautier, a senior research associate at the Center for Applied Research in the Apostolate, an institute at Georgetown University that studies the church. And Catholic Charities is supplemented by a panoply of other Catholic-affiliated groups, Gautier said, including St. Vincent De Paul societies, social justice committees, soup kitchens, food pantries, and other similar programs organized independently by thousands of Catholic parishes each year. For a variety of reasons, its difficult to quantify exactly how big Catholic-backed charity is, but we tried our best to sift the data with the help of the National Center for Charitable Statistics, a project of the Urban Institute, a nonpartisan think tank in Washington. The first question we asked is whether the sum of all Catholic-sponsored charity amounts to half of all charitable activity by private groups in the United States. We started with the biggest, Catholic Charities USA, then worked outward. In 2010, Catholic Charities USA reported expenditures of between $4.2 billion and $4.4 billion, according to the Chronicle of Philanthropy, which publishes an annual list of the 400 biggest charities in the United States, ranked by the amount of donations they receive. This enabled it to rank near the top of the 400 list, behind two major social-services charities -- the United Way and the Salvation Army, neither of which is affiliated with the Catholic church. Meanwhile, Catholic News Service has noted a few other Catholic organizations that made the Chronicles annual 400 list, including Father Flanagan Boys Home and Covenant House. This excludes Catholic universities, which mainly provide higher education; hospitals, which are categorized separately from social services; and groups that focus on overseas work. Lets assume that other Catholic groups that didnt crack the top 400 list spent six times what Catholic Charities USA spent, a multiplier that experts we contacted thought was reasonable. That would make the figure about $26 billion. Then if you suppose that the 18,000 Catholic parishes spent an average of $200,000 on the needy every year beyond what they contribute to any of these charitable organizations, a number also considered plausible by our experts, that would add another $3.6 billion to the total. All told, this would equal about $30 billion. So how does that slice compare to the entire pie? National Center for Charitable Statistics researchers tallied up expenditures by nonprofits in the broad category of human services, which includes nutrition, employment assistance, legal aid, housing, disaster relief and youth development. In 2010, the most recent year available, they came up with total expenditures of $168 billion in that category. So by our estimate, Catholic-affiliated charity amounts to 17 percent of the funds spent by nonprofits on social services -- well short of the 50 percent Keating cited. Even doubling this share to create a generous margin of error brings it to 34 percent -- still well short of half. But even this may overestimate the footprint of Catholic-supported charities, since it doesnt include social-service expenditures by the government. In his comment, Keating didnt specify that he was only talking about social services funded by private groups. According to the Congressional Budget Office, federal spending on means-tested programs and tax credits totaled $588 billion in 2012, more than triple what the private sector spent. If you factor in federal spending on these programs, the Catholic share shrinks further, to somewhere in the mid-single digits, depending on how generous your estimate is. Indeed, the government even foots a notable share of the bill for Catholic charitable work through social service contracts. According to NETWORK, a Catholic social-justice lobbying group, the federal government sent more than $1.5 billion to Catholic organizations over a recent two-year period. In 2012, the Economist reported that 62 percent of Catholic Charities support came from local, state and federal government agencies. And indirectly, the government maintains a tax exemption for churches and charities, which enables all religious groups to devote more of their funds to charitable work. Taxpayers who itemize can also deduct their donations to charities, including Catholic ones. Our ruling Keating said, In the United States, 50 percent of social services are provided by the Catholic church. Hes right that Catholic groups are among the biggest providers of social-service charity in the nation, but it doesnt appear that they account for half of all such charity. Were admittedly using a bit of guesswork, but Catholic charity seems to account for 17 percent to 34 percent of all nonprofit social-service charity, depending on how generous an estimate you make. And that share drops to single digits once you factor in the money the federal government spends on means-tested programs.",0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,Mostly False

Six months later, a livestreamed but opaque audit of ballots from the states most populous county is under way in a 14,870-seat arena. And posts on social media falsely suggest that the audit showed Trump was overtaking Biden. A widely shared Instagram post claimed: Preliminary audit showed Trump ahead by 250,000. Now as it nears completion nearly 950,000 ballots are declared illegal. Nearly all for Biden. The post was flagged as part of Facebooks efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Theres no preliminary results, Ken Bennett, Arizonas former secretary of state and a liaison for the Senate Republicans who ordered the audit, told PolitiFact on May 6. Theres no such finding. Theres been no findings released to either of those effects. The audit, begun April 23, will likely to continue for at least 60 days, Bennett said. He added that under the contract for the audit, no preliminary findings are to be released. A spokesperson for the audit did not reply to our email. Final official results of the November election showed Biden beat Trump in Maricopa County, 1,040,774 votes to 995,665, or by about 2% of the vote. So the Instagram claim would have you believe that the audit found roughly 90% of Bidens votes were illegal. The Maricopa audit was ordered up by Republican state senators, even though the original result has been validated by a hand-count sample audit and a forensic audit of tabulation equipment that found no abnormalities. The GOP hired a team that included Cyber Ninjas, a Florida-based technology company lacking election audit experience. Cyber Ninjas is headed by Doug Logan, who promoted stop the steal conspiracy theories about the election that culminated in the Jan. 6 Capitol attack. The conservative One America News Network, which has aired falsehoods about the 2020 election, set up a nine-camera livestream for the audit, which is being conducted at Veterans Memorial Coliseum in Phoenix. But Cyber Ninjas policies and procedures were released only after a judge ruled that the firm couldnt keep them secret. Reporters initially were restricted from taking notes or filing reports. The false claim follows others that weve debunked about purported findings from the audit.

Final Rating: False  ",The war in Ukraine is scripted and staged.,"Russias military invasion of Ukraine has brought on an onslaught of attacks, injuries and deaths for more than a week. But according to one claim on Facebook, the war is fake. The Feb. 25 post showed a photo of the Joker from the Batman film, The Dark Knight', with text overlaid that read, Them: Lets pray for Ukraine! Me: Its all scripted and staged. The accompanying text post read, Russia and Ukraine is a coverup! and linked to a nine-minute YouTube video that falsely claimed the war is a coverup to distract from COVID-19, which it says was also planned and staged. The post was flagged as part of Facebooks efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) First off, COVID-19 is real. PolitiFact named claims to the contrary its 2020 Lie of the Year. Statistical data, hospitals, medical workers, news reports and more show that the pandemic is authentic, and has caused millions to get sick or die. As for war in Ukraine, daily evidence proves that there is indeed a war. During the early morning of Feb. 24, after months of increased Russian military presence near the Ukrainian border, President Vladimir Putin announced the invasion into Ukraine in a televised speech, calling it a special military operation. Following Russian missile strikes on Feb. 24, 2022, a destroyed car, damaged radar and equipment are shown at a Ukrainian military facility outside Mariupol, Ukraine. (AP Photo) Before the Russian invasion, numerous Ukrainian civilians volunteered to become fighters and took part in military training. Now, theyre on the frontline. NPR, The New York Times and other news sources have extensively covered the situation in Ukraine, where journalists and citizens have transmitted images depicting the war effort. This picture, my God. https://t.co/8m2EDk8cBb pic.twitter.com/YW8dZ2fI04 The exact number of civilians killed is unknown, but as of March 2, Ukraines State Emergency Service estimated more than 2,000 Ukrainians dead, according to CNN. On March 4, the United Nations gave a lower count of 331 people killed, including 19 children, and 675 who were injured. But the real toll is likely to be much higher, Liz Throssell, U.N. spokesperson, said. The U.N. reported that most civilian deaths in the first eight days of conflict were caused by the use of explosive weapons with a wide impact area, including shelling from heavy artillery and multi-launch rocket systems, and missile and air strikes. Russia has also reported casualties. The Russian Defense Ministry announced that 498 Russian troops have died and 1,597 more have been injured, NPR reported. With the impact of the war on civilians being publicly reported, and both sides reporting troops deaths and injuries, the claim that any of this is being staged proves to be baseless. Even more evidence that the conflict is real: the swift response from other countries. NATO has stated they will not engage in the war, but have taken other means of action against Russia. The United States, the European Union and the United Kingdom have joined together in implementing harsh economic sanctions against the Russian economy. During his State of the Union Address on March 1, President Joe Biden announced that, in addition to cutting off Russia's largest banks from the international banking system, the U.S. will join our allies in closing off American air space to all Russian flights – further isolating Russia – and adding an additional squeeze on their economy. The value of the ruble, Russias currency, has fallen to less than one U.S. cent. Rising prices on some products like electronics and appliances have caused citizens to stock up, and NPR reports that arrests of anti-war protesters in Russia are racking up. They cite a Russian human rights group called OVD-Info, whove counted more than 8,000 arrests. Wealthy elites, who also face sanctions, have criticized Putins invasion of Ukraine. Scott Radnitz, an associate professor of Russian and Eurasian studies at the University of Washington, viewed the Facebook post and video, and said that the claim hinges on a world domination conspiracy theory — but there is no evidence presented for why or how the war is being staged. There is little to refute directly, other than to note that thousands or millions of people would have to be in on any conspiracy to fake a war, and like the 9/11 attacks (which some people also deny) there is substantial video footage of attacks on Ukrainian cities, Russian invading forces, and throngs of refugees, Radnitz said. Nevertheless, he added, a true believer will persist in denying all that evidence, something that is easier to do when the conflict is geographically distant and they do not personally know anyone directly affected by it. With a war raging, the world responding and both sides of the conflict experiencing its effects, the claim that the Russian invasion of Ukraine is scripted and staged holds no merit",0,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,False

(We'll leave aside as a minor quibble the fact that communism and Nazism are completely different political philosophies.) Every quotation includes a none of the above option. At the end of quiz, the punch line is thatallthe answers are none of the above — Hillary Clinton said those things! Get it? The problem with the quiz is that every statement is either taken out of context or edited to look worse than it is. In none of the circumstances was Clinton advocating communist-style government for the United States or socialistic economic policies. In some instances she was criticizing out-of-control government spending or the excesses of Big Business; at other times she was saying that complicated issues will require political consensus. Let's look at the quiz items one by one. • From the chain e-mail: We're going to take things away from you on behalf of the common good. This is from 2004 remarks that Clinton made to a roomful of Democratic donors, some of whom paid $10,000 to attend the function, according to the Associated Press. She was discussing the need to end the Bush tax cuts in order to balance the budget. Her full quote was, We're not coming to you, many of whom are well enough off that actually the tax cuts may have helped you, and say 'We're going to give you more.' We're saying, 'You know what, for America to get back on track and be fiscally responsible, we're probably going to cut that short and not give it to you. We're going to take things away from you on behalf of the common good. '  • From the chain e-mail: It's time for a new beginning, for an end to government of the few, by the few, and for the few. ... And to replace it with shared responsibility for shared prosperity. In this one, Clinton was giving a speech in May 2007 attacking the economic policies of the Bush administration. She slammed subsidies for oil and gas companies, tax incentives for companies that move jobs overseas, and excessive CEO pay, according to a report in theConcord (N.H.) Monitor. Notice the italicized phrases that were left out of the chain e-mail quote: It's time for a new beginning, for an end to government of the few, by the few and for the few.Time to reject the idea of an on-your-own societyand replace it with shared responsibility for shared prosperity.I prefer a we're-all-in-it-together society. • From the chain e-mail: (We) ... can't just let business as usual go on, and that means something has to be taken away from some people. Clinton was speaking at a forum on religion and public life hosted by CNN in June 2007. This quote was in reply to a question from a Catholic priest, who asked, In an age in which there is, oftentimes, narrow and excessive individualism, how will you speak to our country about the need for sacrifice, restraint, when it comes to the critical issues of taxes, gun control, health care, and energy consumption? Here's Clinton's more complete response about energy: You know, we can't keep talking about our dependence on foreign oil and the need to deal with global warming and the challenge that it poses to our climate and to God's creation and just let business as usual go on. And that means something has to be taken away from some people. • From the chain e-mail: We have to build a political consensus and that requires people to give up a little bit of their own ... in order to create this common ground. This quote is from the same CNN forum and question mentioned above, but on the health care issue. Clinton's full quote is a little more verbose and concerns the uninsured: I think we could reach that agreement, and then we would have to start doing the hard work of deciding what we were going to do to make sure that they were not uninsured, because an uninsured person who goes to the hospital is more likely to die than an insured person. I mean, that is a fact. So what do we do? We have to build a political consensus, and that requires people giving up a little bit of their own turf in order to create this common ground. • From the chain e-mail: I certainly think the free market has failed. This might be the most egregious of the quiz quotes, because it's taken from a long list of institutions that Clinton says have failed to help kids make good decisions. Clinton was responding to a question, again at the CNN forum, about how antiabortion and proabortion forces can work together to reduce abortions. Clinton said it was important for everyone to help teens make better decisions: We have so many young people who are tremendously influenced by the media culture and by the celebrity culture, and who have a very difficult time trying to sort out the right decisions to make. And I personally believe that the adult society has failed those people. I mean, I think that we have failed them in our churches, our schools, our government. And I certainly think the, you know, free market has failed. We have all failed. • From the chain e-mail: I think it's time to send a clear message to what has become the most profitable sector in (the) entire economy that they are being watched. Clinton's target here was oil companies. She alleged that they were gouging consumers by raising prices after Hurricane Katrina hit New Orleans, according to a 2005Washington Poststory. I think it's time to send a clear message to what has become the most profitable sector in our entire economy that they're being watched, she said in explaining her call for an inquiry by the Federal Trade Commission. I think human nature left to itself is going to push the limit as far as possible, and that's what you need a government regulatory system for: to keep an eye on people to make the rules of the game fair, to make a level playing field and not give anybody some kind of undue advantage. So is Hillary Clinton advocating communism? Hardly. The masked e-mailer hopes you might think so after reading a political tyrants' Hall of Fame list alongside truncated quotes about taking things away and the collective good. We give the mock quiz a failing grade, with extra points deducted for unabashed fearmongering. Its argument that Clinton advocates Marxism is not just False, it's Pants-on-Fire wrong.

Final Rating: False  ",Most likely the primary control knob (for the earths temperature) is the ocean waters and this environment that we live in.,"Energy Secretary Rick Perry downplayed the role of human activity in the recent rise in the Earths temperature, saying natural causes are likely the main driver of climate change. Perry was asked in a CNBC interview if he believed carbon dioxide was the primary control knob for the earths temperature. No. Most likely the primary control knob is the ocean waters and this environment that we live in, Perry said in the June 19 interview. We decided to investigate Perrys claim about climate changes main cause, which scientists have likened to a control knob. Perrys claim flies in the face of settled science. The worlds leading authority on climate change, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, has concluded that human activity is extremely likely to be the main driver of warming since the mid 20th century. While its still possible to find dissenters, scientists around the globe generally agree with this conclusion. The graph below, based on work by NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies, shows just how closely human activity syncs with the earths rising temperature, especially since 1950. The blue line shows how human factors (land use, ozone, aerosols and greenhouse gases) have contributed to global warming. The black line is the Earths recorded temperature since 1880.  This is not to say natural factors dont affect the climate. They do. But Perry is wrong to call them the main cause of the earths rising temperature. When you look at how natural causes (orbital and solar changes plus volcanic activity) have contributed to climate change, its clear the impact is less than that of human factors.  Perry is also wrong to say ocean waters are responsible for the uptick in temperature. While oceans are a vital part of the climate system, and variations in their circulation can affect local climates in important ways, they dont account for global warming, said Gavin Schmidt, climatologist and director of NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies. We have concluded close to all of the recent trends in global temperature is due to human activity, and CO2 is the dominant factor, Schmidt said, referring to carbon dioxide. Perry misidentified climate changes main control knob, but hes not the first Trump administration department head to fudge the facts on our warming planet. We previously issued a False rating to Environmental Protection Agency chief Scott Pruitts claim that carbon dioxide is not a primary contributor to the global warming that we see. In fact, carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas that collects in the earths atmosphere and traps excess heat. It has functioned like a primary control knob thats been dialed up dramatically since humans began releasing significantly more amounts of CO2 into the air, mostly by burning fossil fuels, at the dawn of the Industrial Revolution. A reasonable analogy can be drawn between the way that atmospheric CO2 controls the global temperature of the Earth, and how your house thermostat controls the temperature of your house, said Andrew Lacis, a climatologist at NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies. The NASA graph below shows the influence of greenhouse gas emissions, including a 40 percent increase in atmospheric CO2 since 1750 (green line), on the Earths temperature (black line).  Energy Secretary Rick Perry said, Most likely the primary control knob (for the earths temperature) is the ocean waters and this environment that we live in. Perrys claim contradicts settled science. While natural factors certainly affect the climate, human factors are the main contributor to global warming, and carbon dioxide has acted as the primary control knob governing the earths relatively recent uptick in temperature.

Final Rating: False",Under the Obama plan . . . all the health care in this country is eventually going to be run by the government.,"When Sen. Tom Coburn said that under President Obama, all the health care in this country is eventually going to be run by the government, it was like a golden oldie PolitiFact has heard many times before. During the campaign, we heard the same tune from vice presidential candidateSarah Palin, who said Obama was calling for a government-run plan;Mitt Romney, who said Obama wants the government to take over health care; andRudy Giuliani, who called Hillary Clinton's similar plan socialized medicine.) Coburn, an Oklahoma Republican, made his remarks while criticizing Obama on a different matter. Obama is moving to rescind Bush administration rules that protected medical workers from performing procedures such as abortion that conflicted with their religious or moral beliefs. Coburn, who is against abortion, said rescinding the order would be only a first step for the Obama administration. Remember, under the Obama plan . . . all the health care in this country is eventually going to be run by the government, Coburn said in an interview on Fox News on March 4, 2009. So it's part of an incremental creep towards eliminating any objection, both as us as taxpayers and then individual physicians in terms of not complying with a government-run bureaucracy, he added. Coburn and Obama can fairly disagree about conscience protections for health care workers who oppose abortions. But he's wrong that Obama's plan offers government-run health care. In fact, Obama's plan leaves in place the private health care system, but seeks to expand it to the uninsured. It increases eligibility for the poor and children to enroll in initiatives like Medicaid and the State Childrens Health Insurance Program, and creates pools for individuals to buy their own cheaper insurance. It also outlines strategies to rein in costs for everyone, such as electronic medical records and preventive care. I think most of us would agree that if we want to cover all Americans, we can't make the mistake of trying to fix what isn't broken, Obama said at a health care conference he hosted on March 5. So if somebody has insurance they like, they should be able to keep that insurance. If they have a doctor that they like, they should be able to keep their doctor. They should just pay less for the care that they receive. Would Obama's plan result in closer regulation of the health care system? Very likely so. It includes provisions that require health insurance companies to cover pre-existing conditions and disclose more information about how they treat patients. Obama's plan also calls for evidence-based health care standards, so that government can stop paying (through programs like Medicare) for treatments that don't get good results. But the plan is very different from some European-style health systems where the government owns health clinics and employs doctors. We asked Coburn's office about his remarks. What matters is not just President Obamas intent, or what his plan states, but the likely effect and consequences of his plan, said spokesman John Hart. Under Obamas approach, the only plans left standing will be those controlled by the government. That may be Sen. Coburn's opinion on what could happen, but it's definitely not part of Obama's plan. And Coburn was very specific in saying that under the Obama plan, all the health care in this country is eventually going to be run by the government. That gives the incorrect impression that Obama is promoting a government-run health care system. He's not.",0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,False

Final Rating: Mostly False  ","Very, very, very few people get a pat-down when they go through airport security.","As luck would have it, U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano had heaps of ornery subjects to tackle during a recent talk before the Atlanta Press Club. Attendees at the May 7 luncheon peppered her with questions about Osama bin Ladens death, which took place just five days earlier. They asked about Georgias new immigration legislation and the Federal Emergency Management Agencys response to recent, historic tornadoes that devastated towns across the Southeast.One raised the touchiest -- literally -- of all of topics: getting patted down at the airport.Will we go past the grope-and-grab phase? a luncheon attendee asked Napolitano. The machines that scan the bodies and so forth? Are there better ways of doing it?Well, actually, very, very, very few people get a pat-down, Napolitano replied. Its only under very limited circumstances. They do, however, get -- those who are patted down -- tend to get on YouTube. she quipped.And look, look, no one wants to see a 6-year-old patted down. Even if its done according to procedural protocol, she said. In April, a video was posted on YouTube.com of a 6-year-old girl being patted down at the New Orleans airport.Just this week, images of a baby getting frisked at Kansas City International Airport made headlines as well.Very, very, very few people? we wondered. Thats a lot of verys.Given the public outcry, Napolitanos estimate sent PolitiFact Georgia scribes scrambling.We asked the Transportation Security Administration for more details. The TSA is part of the Department of Homeland Security and protects the nations transportation systems.Last fall, the TSA began to use special scanners that showed images of passengers including what was underneath their clothing. Critics called it a virtual strip search and said it was too invasive.The TSA offered pat-downs as an alternative, but these also frustrated critics. In October, the agency announced that officers would implement enhanced pat-down procedures. Previously, screeners used the backs of their hands to inspect sensitive areas. Now they use the front of their hands and conduct a more thorough search.Adults can also receive pat-downs on a random basis. Children receive modified pat-downs if they require extra screening.As the busy Thanksgiving travel week approached, passengers complained about having their genitals and breasts touched. A video appeared on YouTube.com of a toddler crying during the pat-down and shouting for a screener to stop. Parents were outraged. Travelers threatened they would stop flying, and some predicted long airport security lines.The expected chaos never materialized. For the most part, passengers went through the screening process without a fuss.All in all, people wanted to get to their destinations, said Christopher Bidwell, a security expert with the industry group Airports Council International.We asked the TSA how many pat-downs it conducts at the nations airports.Atlanta TSA spokesman Jon Allen told us that during March, 3 percent of air passengers were subject to a pat-down. The TSA collects this data by monitoring data from select airports throughout the year, he wrote in an email. That number is consistent with that of previous time periods.PolitiFact Georgia looked for other pat-down data to see whether other groups have verified TSA numbers. Critics such as the American Civil Liberties Union and passenger rights groups did not. Neither did industry groups we contacted. We did find a Gallup poll conducted Nov. 19-21 that said 15 percent of adults who have flown two or more times in the past year received a full-body pat-down. The surveys margin of error was 4 percentage points. The 15 percent figure does not contradict the TSA figures. The more often you pass through a security checkpoint, the more chance youll receive a pat-down.PolitiFact Georgia therefore took the TSA figures and did some math. The TSAs Allen told us that on an average day, about 2 million people are screened at TSA checkpoints. Three percent of 2 million is 60,000 people.That means that over the course of a month, roughly 1.8 million people receive a pat-down. Thats more than four times the population of Atlanta.That doesnt sound like very, very, very few people to us.If Napolitano said that a small percentage of passengers get patted down each month, she would have been correct. But she talked about people. In addition, she used the superlative very three times, even though the TSAs own figures show that the numbers of passengers who receive a pat-down can top 1 million in a single month.",0.2,0.8,0.9,0.3,0.1,0.2,0.6,0.9,0.6,Mostly False

Final Rating: Half True  ","None of the polls being conducted right now have us on the top line. None of them. It's always Trump and Clinton and then second question, third question. ... If we were included in the top line, as Johnson/Trump/Clinton, we'd be at 20 percent.","The only poll that matters, dealers in political cliches tell us, is the one taken on Election Day. For third party candidates, the Committee on Presidential Debates has imposed another consequential metric: they must reach 15 percent in a select set of polls if they want access to the debates and the attention and credibility that are attached. Right now, it looks like Clinton and Trump will be alone on stage come debate season. But if the polls were just conducted differently, Libertarian presidential candidate Gary Johnson has suggested he would easily meet that requirement. None of the polls being conducted right now have us on the top line. None of them. It's always Trump and Clinton and then second question, third question, Well, what if you add Johnson-Weld?, Johnson told CNBC on August 22. In a couple of other cases Johnson specified how well he thinks hed be doing if he were listed as an option in pollsters first horse-race question: 20 percent, more than enough to qualify for the debates. I think if we were included in the top line, as Johnson/Trump/Clinton, we'd be at 20 percent. A lot of that has to do with how polarizing the two of them are. But that's the issue right now. We need to be top line on the polls, Johnson said in another CNBC interview on Aug. 11. This would be quite a swing. Theodore Roosevelt was the last third-party presidential candidate to register more than 20 percent of the vote on Election Day, running as a Bull Moose in 1912, and Ross Perot reached18.9 percent in 1992. We decided to look at whether the polls are really being conducted the way Johnson says, and if it really has such a dramatic impact. We looked at 25 national polls conducted in July and August, chosen off of a list compiled by FiveThiryEight.com. Based on this list, we can say that Johnson is certainly wrong that every poll asks about Clinton and Trump before adding his name in a later question. Eleven of the polls we looked at -- close to half -- included Johnson in their first or only question about the presidential horse-race. None of these polls vaulted Gary Johnson to 20 percent. In fact, he did slightly worse, on average, when he was included in the first horse-race question. Johnsons average in the 25 polls was 9 percent. When he was listed in a later horse-race question, his average performance was slightly higher than that average. In the polls where he was listed in the first or only horse-race question, Johnson did slightly worse on average. Some of his best performances -- 12 percent in polls conducted for Fox News and International Business Daily and 13 percent in a poll conducted for CNN -- were in polls that listed him in a later question. We ran Johnsons theory by several academics who study polling. While research hasnt been done on the specific question Johnson addresses, they told us that question order could have an effect on polling results. All of them were, however, skeptical that the effect could be as large as Johnson suggested. It's not a totally crazy notion to think that including him in the first round versus not might affect his support. As a researcher, I would ask how big an effect that would have to be to get the kind of outcome he said.  You would have to have an effect of about 12 percent shift, which to me is just implausible, Adam Berinsky, a professor of political science at MIT. Even if there was some sort of bias introduced by the question order, it wouldnt necessarily be in his favor. (Trump and Clinton) have the lowest favorability ratings of presidential candidates in recent memory. So I could spin a story that would suggest if you first ask about Clinton or Trump without Johnson, you kind of prime people to think I dont really like either of these folks. And then you include the question with him in it, and they say, Oh, theres another option, Berinsky said. When reached for comment about this article, Johnson communications director Joe Hunter wrote in an email that, As far as the issue of whether a third candidate is included in the first ballot test question, or added to a subsequent question, we believe it does, indeed, make a difference, and pollsters with whom we work agree. Since Johnsons likely to appear on the ballot in all 50 states, it's worth considering why any pollster puts forward a horse-race question without including his name. Support for third party candidates tends to flag down the stretch, with many of their supporters leaving for one of the major party options. Questions that only offer those candidates allow pollsters to get a sense of how people currently registering support for third parties might break if that happens. It's worth noting that Johnson seems to be bucking this trend, according to a recent articleby the polling analysts at 538. Based on current polling, 538s polls-plus general election forecast, which adjusts for economic factors and historical trends, expects Johnson to earn a bigger percentage of the vote than any third-party candidate since Ross Perot in 1992. Our ruling Johnson said that polls ask about a straight Clinton/Trump race first, cueing them to ignore his name when it appears later. He said that including his name in the first questions pollsters asked about the horse-race could increase his support to 20 percent. Many polls do include Johnsons name in their first horse-race poll, and Johnson does not do better in these polls. Experts say the jump Johnson is talking about is implausible. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/5b71a65b-45a3-4b7b-bb80-9222bc73ff4e",0.5,0.5,1.0,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,1.0,0.5,Half True

Final Rating: False  ","In eighth grade math, weve fallen to ninth place.","In his first major education speech, President Obama endorsed charter schools, merit pay for teachersand increases in school spending. He justified his agenda partly by saying American students are slipping compared to counterparts around the world. We've let our grades slip, our schools crumble, our teacher quality fall short, and other nations outpace us, Obama said in the March 10 speech to the United States Hispanic Chamber of Commerce. In eighth grade math, we've fallen to ninth place. Since Obama brought up math, we decided to check his. Turns out we had to pull out the red pen. We asked the White House to defend Obama's claim, and received no response. His claim that eighth grade math studentsin the United States are in ninth place internationally almost certainly comes from the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study, a periodic comparison of math and science achievement carried out since 1995 by research institutions and government agencies worldwide. Themost recent study, published in 2007, did indeed show U.S. eighth graders in ninth place behind five East Asian countries and Hungary, England and Russia. But it was misleading to say they had fallen to ninth place. In 1995, theycame in 28th. In 1999, theymoved up to 19th. In 2003, they climbedto 15th. So rather than falling, U.S. students have actuallyimprovedin the past decade. We considered giving the president partial credit since American students did come in ninth. But the point of his statement was that they had fallen to that position and that mathematics performance in the United States is getting worse relative to other countries.

Final Rating: Mostly False",Says Joe Kyrillos voted to raid the state's pension funds by $2.8 billion that is costing New Jersey taxpayers still today to the tune of nearly $15 billion dollars to repay that money.,"A theme is emerging in New Jerseys U.S. Senate race: opponents blaming one another for bloating government debt.Republican challenger state Sen. Joe Kyrillos has tied U.S. Sen. Robert Menendez to growth in the national debt and deficits. In an interview on NJTVs On the Record that aired June 8, Menendez, a Democrat, responded to those charges.Well first of all, evidently my Republican opponent has selective memory, Menendez said, first citing growth in state debt under Kyrillos watch.Then, Menendez said: Here's someone who raided the state's -- voted to raid the state's pension funds by $2.8 billion that is costing New Jersey taxpayers still today to the tune of nearly $15 billion dollars to repay that money.Kyrillos helped pushed through a controversial plan in 1997 from then-Gov. Christie Whitman to sell nearly $2.8 billion in bonds in a bid to cover unfunded liabilities in the states pension system.To be clear, we are not ruling on whether the pension bonds were sound fiscal policy. We are also not ruling on Whitmans overall impact on the pension system. Were looking at two, specific claims: whether voting for the bonds constituted a $2.8 billion raid on the pension system and whether they are costing taxpayers $15 billion to pay off.Both statements veer from the truth, PolitiFact New Jersey found.The bond legislation -- approved on June 5, 1997, with Kyrillos voting in favor of it -- authorized the states Economic Development Authority to sell $2.75 billion in bonds, the proceeds of which were deposited in state retirement funds for public workers.A separate, companion bill changed accounting rules for the pension system and allowed the state and local employers to reduce their normal contributions by the amount of surplus in the funds.The move allowed Whitman to avoid making nearly $600 million in payments into the pension system that year, which helped balance her budget.Melissa Castro, a spokeswoman for the Menendez campaign, said skipping scheduled payments into the pension system is a raid of pension funds, because by definition, it is reducing the total funds available to pay the funds' obligations.Whitman skipped payments that year -- as she did in others -- but she put nearly $2.8 billion of borrowed money in the funds. That does not fit the definition of a raid.Now, whats the final price tag for those pension bonds, which mature in 2029?Menendez put the tab at nearly $15 billion. According to the state Treasury Department, the bonds -- which the state is paying more than 7 percent interest on -- will cost $10.1 billion to pay off. The general fund shoulders the burden of the bond payments, not the pension system.Treasury Department spokesman Andy Pratt said its unfair to look at the expense of the bonds without also considering the investment interest the money is earning. The average rate of return has been 6.36 percent a year, Pratt said.Ultimately, the states general fund is still on the hook for $10.1 billion. In the upcoming budget, debt service on the bonds will cost nearly $300 million.Castro said whether it was $15 billion or $10 billion, Menendez is still correct on his fundamental point. Nevertheless this is still bad fiscal policy, she said.Our rulingMenendez said Kyrillos voted to raid the state's pension funds by $2.8 billion that is costing New Jersey taxpayers still today to the tune of nearly $15 billion dollars to repay that money.Kyrillos voted in favor of borrowing $2.75 billion to put into the states pension funds. The move allowed Whitman to avoid nearly $600 million in pension payments that year, but overall, money went into the system, not out of it. To call it a vote to raid pension funds by $2.8 billion is inaccurate.Also, the bonds will cost taxpayers, in total, about $10.1 billion, not $15 billion.To comment on this ruling, go to NJ.com.",0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,Mostly False

Final Rating: Mostly False  ",Says Hillary Clinton wants to go to a single-payer plan for health care,"Donald Trump called the Affordable Care Act a disaster that he wants to repeal and that Hillary Clinton would make health care even worse. She wants to go to a single-payer plan, which would be a disaster, Trump said during the presidential debate at Washington University in St. Louis Oct. 9. Somewhat similar to Canada. And if you ever noticed the Canadians -- when they need a big operation when something happens, they come into the United States in many cases because their system is so slow, it's catastrophic in certain ways. But, she wants to go to single payer which means the government basically rules everything. Does Clinton want to move the United States to a single-payer system for health care? Clintons health care plan  Converting Obamacare to a single-payer program would make it, like Medicare, a federal health insurance program run by the federal government. Under a single-payer system, the government provides health care for everyone. Currently, Obamacare promotes policies supplied by private insurance companies. Some Democrats — including, at one time, Barack Obama — pushed for a single-payer system. But there wasnt enough support for that, and ultimately Congress approved a plan that allows different insurance plans offered in marketplaces by individual states and the federal government. During the vice presidential debate, Trumps running mate Gov. Mike Pence made a similar claim that Clinton and and Tim Kaine want to expand (Obamacare) into a single-payer program. For our fact-check of Pence, Trump spokesman Dan Kowalski pointed us to the health care page on Clinton's website. It indicates that she supports a 'public option' for Obamacare, Kowalski said. A 'public option' is a single-payer-like option for health care delivery. Here is exactly what she said on her campaign website about a public option: Defend and expand the Affordable Care Act, which covers 20 million people. Hillary will stand up to Republican-led attacks on this landmark law—and build on its success to bring the promise of affordable health care to more people and make a public option possible. She will also support letting people over 55 years old buy into Medicare. So Clinton does want a public option, but she is calling for adding the public option to the existing options. Clinton has consistently said, including during the Oct. 9 debate, that she wants to protect Obamacare from being repealed by the Republicans. She has called for expanding it to include tax credits, eliminating the out-of-network hospital charges many plans levy, and reducing prescription drug costs by removing the ban that prevents the federal government from negotiating drug prices and allowing Americans to important their drugs from countries with cheaper prices. We previously asked the Trump campaign if they had seen any statements from Clinton or Kaine indicating that converting Obamacare into a single-payer system was their eventual goal. Kowalski responded that Hillary has committed fully to the public option, and as evidence he directed us to comments Clinton made in 1994 when she was first lady. At the time, she predicted that if Congress didn't pass health care reform soon, I believe, and I may be totally off base on this, but I believe that by the year 2000 we will have a single-payer system. I dont think its — I dont even think its a close call politically. Later in her answer Clinton says there are three ways to get universal health coverage, only one of which is a single-payer system. The other two: an employer mandate or an individual mandate, which is how Obamacare works. WikiLeaks speech excerpt about single-payer A few days after the vice presidential debate, WikiLeaks published emails from Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta. A Jan. 25 email from Clinton campaign research director Tony Carrk to Podesta contained excerpts of Clintons paid speeches to Wall Street banks. (For months Clinton has faced calls to release the speeches but hasnt done so.) One excerpt related to single-payer systems was from remarks she gave to ECGR Grand Rapids on June 17, 2013. She gave a speech to the Economic Club of Grand Rapids in Michigan that day. If you look at countries that are comparable, like Switzerland or Germany, for example, they have mixed systems. They don't have just a single-payer system, but they have very clear controls over budgeting and accountability. If you look at the single-payer systems, like Scandinavia, Canada, and elsewhere, they can get costs down because, you know, although their care, according to statistics, overall is as good or better on primary care, in particular, they do impose things like waiting times, you know. It takes longer to get like a hip replacement than it might take here. We cant fully evaluate Clintons speech because WikiLeaks published only excerpts. (We asked the Clinton campaign for a fully copy but did not get a response to that request.) However, Clinton praised single-payer because she says it keeps costs down, but she also said that it imposes wait times. And she also praised systems like Switzerland for having clear budget controls and said they dont have single payer. Clinton campaign spokesman Josh Schwerin sent us a brief fact-check in Politico that was headlined: No, Clinton has not been after single payer for years. One final note: Trump has been all over the map on single-payer health care if we trace his comments back to his first race for president in 2000. The Canadian plan also helps Canadians live longer and healthier than America.  We need, as a nation, to reexamine the single-payer plan, as many individual states are doing, Trump wrote in his 2000 book The America We Deserve. Other times in the past couple of years he has praised it, but he has also said he doesnt support it. His campaign plan on his website emphasizes free market principles. Our ruling Trump says Clinton wants to go to a single-payer plan for health care. She has consistently said she would fight efforts to repeal Obamacare and would try to improve it. She said she wants a public option to be possible but she has not called for moving to a system of only single payer. Clinton has not called for a single-payer plan. At times, she has praised the health care systems of other countries that have a single-payer plan, but she has not advocated that plan for the United States. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/4bde16f2-778f-4229-b2d2-a3819786738b",0,0.8,1,0.6,0,0.7,0.5,1,0.6,Mostly False

Final Rating: Mostly False  ","Says Rick Scott spent $800,000 of your tax dollars upgrading the Governor's Mansion.","Florida gubernatorial candidates are now taking shots at each others wallets in campaign commercials, with Democratic challenger Charlie Crist working overtime to get voters to realize that millionaire Gov. Rick Scott is, in fact, a millionaire. He flies on a private jet and owns an $11 million oceanfront home, an Oct. 24, 2014 ad says. Rick Scott is used to the finer things. Maybe that's why he spent $800,000 of your tax dollars upgrading the Governor's Mansion. The commercial then repeats a lot of prior attacks about education spending. Meanwhile, we got to wondering whether Scott, who campaigned in 2010 on cutting government spending, spent $800,000 on his new home in Tallahassee after taking office. Ringing up the renovations As the basis for theclaim, the Crist campaign sent us an Oct. 28, 2013, Associated Press story posted on CBS Miamis website. That story said that more than $800,000 in renovations had occurred at the governors Greek Revival mansion at 700 N. Adams St. Those renovations included cleaning oriental rugs, refinishing wood floors, new wallpaper, pillows, furniture, drapes, paint, window repairs, new screens for the swimming pool and an upgraded kitchen, the story read. According to the story, the state spent almost $3 million on the property during Gov. Jeb Bushs eight years in office, although a third of that money was for security upgrades after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. Thestory said that during Crists four-year term from 2007-2011, the state spent a bit more than $27,000. The AP later corrected this amount to almost $443,000. Of the $800,000 the AP said was spent during Scotts term, almost $600,000 was taxpayer money that went to grounds upkeep, the story said. More than $200,000 more was donated to the Governors Mansion Foundation by U.S. Sugar, Florida Crystals and Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Florida. There were also $20,000 in gifts from lobbyist Brian Ballard, Scott adviser Tony Fabrizio and the CEO of a private prison company, George Zoley. That private money was used to pay for things like $38,000 in new rugs and $2,000 for a new mirror for First Lady Ann Scott, who had been an interior designer, the AP story said. For this fact-check, we wont look at private donations, because Crist said your tax dollars. The Scott campaign said the mansion has routinely been funded by both public and private money, and that the public money involved was used according to state law. It paid for things like code compliance in the kitchen, repairing safety hazards in public areas, electrical upgrades and plumbing repairs, spokesman Greg Blair said. We checked in with the Department of Management Services, the agency that handles expenses for upkeep. Spokesman Ben Wolf told us that the DMS has a budget for mansion projects, and periodic fixes are needed. He declined to be more specific for us. He did give us totals for renovations, maintenance and purchases made for the mansions improvements using public money, but we found some numbers were a bit different than what the AP reported in 2013. From January 1999 to December 2006, Jeb Bushs terms in office, the total was $2.87 million, including post-Sept. 11 security upgrades such as buying surrounding property and putting up barriers. The total from Crists term, January 2007 to December 2010, was almost $443,000, including almost $254,000 for heating and cooling ductwork and $102,000 for the design and installation of a fuel cell designed to cut emissions and power use. Adding in miscellaneous purchases like tools, supplies, building materials, freight and so on, the total went up to almost $628,000. As for Scott, the DMS disclosure said a little more than $499,000 had been spent for the things Blair claimed. Although that measured more than just 2011, that year is when the bulk of the expenses were incurred. (Well also note that more than $10,000 in tax money was spent on cabana repairs.) Add in other expenditures, as we did with Crist and Bush, and the grand total from January 2011 to the present is almost $745,000.  In 2013, the Department of Management Services said the agency had reviewed the mansion and decided it needed some freshening, without Scotts input. Scotts office said then that neither the governor nor the first lady asked for the changes, but the AP reported that May 2011 meeting minutes from a Governors Mansion Committee gathering showed Ann Scott had mentioned the houses condition. Its important to me to maintain its beauty and showcase its history, making the mansion a welcome destination for all guests, she said. We also tried contacting mansion curator Carol Beck several times, but never heard back. She was quoted in the AP story as saying Department of Management Services officials have been exceptionally proactive in addressing concerns of the first lady and myself as it relates to the current condition of the interior and exterior of the mansion proper, as well as the grounds. This wasnt the only time spending on the manse has been an issue. In 2011 and 2012, staffers were instructed to use private phone lines and email accounts while working to find about $5 million in public and private money to buy commercial property around the mansion and turn it into a public space. Our ruling Crist said Scott spent $800,000 of your tax dollars upgrading the Governor's Mansion. When we checked with the agency in charge what the totals were, it said almost $745,000 in taxpayer money had been spent during Scotts term. So the amount of tax money spent on renovations at the mansion is close. However, the ad is trying to make it sound like Scott was being wasteful, and that's not as clear. The Crist and Bush administrations also spent large sums on expensive renovations, and the money doesn't appear to have come from a direct request from Scott (although the Scotts did accept donations to spruce up the mansion).",0.7,0.5,1.0,0.6,0.4,0.5,0.4,0.8,0.6,Mostly False

Final Rating: Half True  ","Says that in the last five years, Texas created more jobs than all other states combined.","The president of the conservative Texas Public Policy Foundation, Brooke Rollins, touts Texas economic strength in a TV ad that aired in April and May, saying that in the last five years, weve created more jobs than all other states combined. After a reader asked us to check Rollins claim, Joshua Trevino, a foundation spokesman, pointed us to information the foundation culled from the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics monthly employment data — specifically, figures from the Current Employment Statistics series, which is calculated using a broad survey of employer payroll data. First, the foundation identified those states where the number of jobs had grown between January 2006 and January 2011. There were only 10 states in that group. Texas ranked No. 1, with an increase of 545,900 jobs, from about 9.93 million to about 10.47 million. The other nine states, ranging in size from Louisiana to Wyoming, had a combined jobs increase of 183,700. However, that's not to say jobs werent lost in Texas during those years. Employment numbers fluctuate. At the states most recent peak, in August 2008, Texas had about 10.64 million jobs. About a year later, with the recession in full swing, Texas had about 400,000 less. Next, we asked the Texas Workforce Commission about the foundations claim. Lisa Givens, an agency spokeswoman, sent us a 50-state comparison of job growth also using monthly BLS figures. However, Givens accounting covered a more recent five-year period, March 2006 to March 2011 — numbers for which were still preliminary. Nine states, including Texas, had more jobs in March 2011 than in that month five years earlier. And Texas gains far outpaced the combined total for the other states: 539,500 vs. 134,400. So, the foundations figures stand up — in the way that such figures are often analyzed, including by PolitiFact. Unsaid is that this gauge defines job creation as a net increase in employment. That means the foundations analysis only takes into account the number of jobs created in excess of the number lost over a five-year period. But new jobs also sprung up in the other 40 states, although they were offset by greater losses. Is it fair to assess job creation without including them? Weve gone back and forth on that question. Rick Perry that Texas had created more than 850,000 jobs, more than all the other states combined. To come up with that number, Perrys campaign also looked at net job growth, although over a longer time period: January 2001 to June 2010. During our research of the Perry statement, Cheryl Abbot, a BLS economist in Dallas, told us that the governors statement was correct. We touched base with her again on the foundations TV statement, which she said has a legitimate basis.S. from November 2007-2008 were in Texas. We found that the Texas Workforce Commission, like the Texas Public Policy Foundation, had restricted its comparison to the states that experienced a net increase in employment; during the specified time period, there were 14 total, including Texas. While we researched that item, Michael Brandl, a senior lecturer at the University of Texas McCombs School of Business, told us that excluding all those states with net job losses — and disregarding any jobs gained in those states — exaggerates the Texas share of total new jobs in the U.S. To say it's misleading is to be kind, Brandi said. It's just not true. The Truth-O-Meter score so far: one ruling that favors net increases in employment as a valid gauge of job creation — and one that doesnt. Seeking more clarity, we turned to Jason Faberman, a senior economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia who has written an article on the BLS data sources. He agreed that it could be misleading to consider only net increases in jobs as job creation. But, he said, the public is accustomed to hearing it discussed that way. When most policy, political and media people refer to jobs created or added, they are referring to the net gain in employment over some period, Faberman said. Givens, at the workforce commission, told us that when the agency refers to net employment gains, it says jobs were added rather than created. What happens if you look at total jobs created, not just the net gain? Then Texas is no longer No. 1. The BLS keeps annual data, starting from April 1 each year, on total private sector job gains and losses. During the most recent three years — 2008, 2009 and 2010 — California gained an average of 1.3 million jobs annually, while Texas posted an average of 935,000 jobs. However, California also lost an average of 1.8 million jobs while Texas lost 992,000. However, Abbot cautioned that gross job numbers generally reflect a states population, meaning that big states would post bigger numbers than small ones. Theres no way that a Kansas could compare with a Texas, Abbot said. Faberman agreed that comparing gross job gains isnt the best way to fact-check the foundations statement. Instead, he suggested comparing Texas net employment change with that of the whole country, minus Texas share. What we found: In January 2011, the United States, excluding Texas, had 5.3 million fewer jobs than it did in January 2006 — the five-year period used by the foundation. That compares with the 545,900 increase that Texas experienced during that time. So, by Fabermans measure, Texas outperformed the rest of the country. We came across another way of thinking about job creation in an Aug. 24 blog on the Houston Chronicles website. According to the post, an unidentified economist noted that any raw job count would naturally favor Texas in a comparison with other net-gain states and asked what would happen if the size of the states job forces were factored in. The Chronicle did that by calculating the percentage increase in the states jobs between July 2009 and July 2010, and Texas still came out on top — but barely. Inspired by the Chronicle, we looked again at the 10 states with net job gains over the last five years. Texas gains represented a 5.5 percent increase in employment from January 2006 to January 2011. For the nine other states, their total increase of 183,700 jobs was a 2.5 percent increase. However, comparing the states individually, two had larger percentage increases than Texas: North Dakota (10.6 percent) and Alaska (5.7 percent). Another factor that changes — even reverses — the job creation numbers is the time frame. The longer the time frame, the better Texas numbers look. Comparing employment in a single month in 2006 with the same month five years later, Texas job numbers grow. Shorten the time period to three years, and Texas shows a net loss in jobs, going from 10.56 million jobs in January 2008 to 10.47 million in January 2011. So whats our (latest) ruling on job creation? The foundations claim that Texas created more jobs than all other states combined stands up — considering only those states that had net job gains over five years. Thats the methodology usually used to define job creation in public discourse. But the foundations analysis disregards the 40 states where millions of jobs were created but were outnumbered by losses. And looking at the percentage increase in jobs relative to the size of each states work force — another telling statistic — two other states experienced greater gains than Texas.",0.5,0.5,1,0.5,0,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,Half True

Final Rating: Half True  ",Says between 6 and 20 bicycles can be parked in the space required by one car.,"U.S. Rep. Earl Blumenauer has been associated with many causes during his 17 years in Congress. Bow ties come to mind, as does his support for protecting public lands. As founder and co-chair of the Congressional Bicycle Caucus, Blumenauer has been a leading voice in trying to establish the bicycle as a viable form of urban transportation. On the Bike and Pedestrian Issues page of his official website, he says that cycling improves health, is good for the environment and reduces transportation costs. One assertion in particular jumps out. It says, Between 6 and 20 bicycles can be parked in the space required by one car. PolitiFact Oregon wondered whether thats true. At first glance, the notion of up to 20 bicycles jammed into a single parking space seems a little much. To get an explanation, we called Blumenauers Washington, D.C., office and talked with spokesman Patrick Malone. Malone said the figure came from a paper published in 2011 by researcher Thomas Gotschi. Costs and Benefits of Bicycling Investments in Portland, Oregon was published in the Journal of Physical Activity & Health. A close reading does not reveal statistics addressing how many bicycles fit into a parking space. One section includes a sentence reading, The millions of miles traveled by bike reduce road and parking capacity demand, which is much more costly to provide for cars than for bikes. Its followed by a footnote, which took us to a second study, published this summer by the Victoria (B.C.) Transport Policy Institute. That 59-page study, written by Todd Litman, states, 10-20 bicycles can typically be stored in the space required for one automobile. Malone also referred to the bike corrals scattered around downtown Portland that hold 12 bicycles each, all in the amount of room needed to park a car. Then, noting two-tiered indoor bike parking available at Portland State University, he added, If you took the bike corrals we have now and put in double-decker parking with locks and lift assists, you could double that. Scott Cohen, the Portland Bureau of Transportations transportation demand management specialist, said Portland has 99 bike corrals. The portion that holds bicycles is 17 feet long and accommodates up to 12 bikes. A standard marked car-parking space is 20 feet long and about 10 feet wide. None of the corrals is the two-tier type mentioned by Malone. So 12 is the highest number of bicycle anyone will see in an area the size of a parking space. Two-tiered bike racks are available online but are primarily designed for commercial storage and retail bike storage and display. Several commercial racks hold as many as 20 bikes in 20 feet, but they need to be mounted to a wall or ceiling and arent really designed for outdoor use. Portland-based Alta Planning & Design, which has rolled out its Bicycle Share program in eight cities in the U.S. and abroad, says its racks fit about 10 bicycles in the length of a parking space. What if people simply stood their bikes next to one another or heaped them in a pile? Could 20 bikes fit inside a parking space then? Probably, but those options seem highly unlikely in the United States, and Malone didnt mention them. Twelve bicycles can be locked safely in downtown Portland bike corrals, but 20 stretches the limits of anything in use -- in Portland and nationwide. The Pedestrian and Bicycle Information Center says streetside bike corrals should accommodate 10 to 12 bikes. The Association of Pedestrian and Bicycle Professionals recommends spacing so that no more than 12 fit into a parking spot. As for the mechanical lifts available at PSU: Those wont be showing on city streets anytime soon. City policies allow only one-tier corrals, and businesses that already pay the city $2,600 to install one seem unlikely to want to pony up more. Blumenauers office does cite a study with a footnote leading to another study that says 10 to 20 bikes can fit into a single parking spot. The congressmans website also gives a range of 6 to 20 bikes, while 12 can commonly fit in corrals. So we find his statement Half True.",0.5,0.5,1.0,0.5,0.0,0.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,Half True

Final Rating: Half True  ","Says border fencing finished near El Paso in 2010 dramatically curtailed illegal crossings, local crime and drug smuggling.","Conservative Paul Sperry highlighted fencing erected near El Paso a decade ago as evidence that President Donald Trumps proposed border wall could enhance security. Sperry wrote in a January 2018 New York Post commentary that the fencing, described as completed in 2010, explains a dramatic decrease in violent crime in the West Texas city and plummets in illegal crossings and drug smuggling. We wondered about that after Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, promoted Sperrys commentary on Twitter and Bob Moore, former executive editor of the El Paso Times, asserted in his own tweet that El Paso had low violent crime rates as far back as 2005 while illegal border crossings, Moore wrote, decreased for varied reasons around 2010 including the Great Recession. Sperry, whom we emailed without hearing back, wrote that once the fencing went up, illegal crossings and levels of violent crime and drug smuggling rapidly subsided and that since then, El Paso has consistently topped rankings for cities of 500,000 residents or more with low crime rates, based on FBI-collected statistics. We'd suggest that claims about anycitys safety rankbe considered with caution. Such rankings are oft tied to FBI statistics that the agency counsels against using to rank or compare communities. Weve also done several separate fact-checks noting flaws in claims about El Pasos safety standing. On another front, it appears the fencing touted by Sperry was not finished in 2010. Ramiro Cordero, a spokesman for the Border Patrols El Paso sector, which takes in New Mexico, El Paso County and part of adjoining Hudspeth County, advised by email that from 2007 to approximately 2014, two types of fencing got built near the El Paso metro area: double-layered mesh 18 feet tall and mesh on movable barriers going up 22 feet. In 2009, David Aguilar of the Border Patrol specified at a U.S. Senate hearing that 626 miles of congressionally ordered fencing had been completed along the border. When fully built, Aguilar said, the additions would cover 661 miles from Texas into California, counting 115 miles each in New Mexico and Texas. Decreased illegal alien apprehensions We exploredeach part of Sperrys statement separately, starting with whether the new fencing greatly diminished border crossings. All along the southwestern border, its worth noting, apprehensions by the Border Patrol peaked in 2000 at 1.6 million (yearly total) and later generally declined starting around the time of the 2008-09 recession, Michelle Mittelstadt of the Migration Policy Institute, a nonpartisan think tank that studies worldwide immigration, has noted. Mittelstadt told PolitiFact in April 2017 that factors in Mexico had contributed to the drop-offs including lower birth rates, increased educational levels and an improved economy. In his commentary, Sperry wrote that according to Homeland Security data, the number of deportable illegal immigrants located by the U.S. Border Patrol plummeted by more than 89 percent over the five-year period during which the fencing between El Paso and neighboring Ciudad Juarez, Mexico, was completed. Sperry said that when the El Paso fencing project started in 2006, illegal crossings totaled 122,261, but by 2010, when the 131-mile fence was completed from one end of El Paso out into the New Mexico desert, immigrant crossings shrank to just 12,251. They hit a low of 9,678 in 2012, before slowly ticking back up to a total of 25,193 last year. But theyre still well below pre-fence levels, and the Border Patrol credits the fortified barrier dividing El Paso from Mexico for the reduction in illegal flows, Sperry wrote. We found that he accurately recapped government-posted tallies of illegal alien apprehensions, which are generally used as a metric to measure illegal immigration. An exception: When we checked, the Border Patrol was reporting a slightly greater number of apprehensions in 2006, 122,656 making the 9,678 apprehensions in the sector in 2012 92 percent less than apprehensions in 2006. Unaddressed by Sperry: All along the nations southern border, according to the Border Patrol, apprehensions decreased each year from 2007 through 2011. That is, the agencys pre-2017 low of 327,577 apprehensions in 2011 was down 69 percent from 1,071,972 apprehensions in 2006 and down 72 percent from 1,171,396 apprehensions in 2005. Border Patrol video singles out change in tactics Next, we reached out to the Border Patrol to ask about the fencing alone driving down apprehensions. We fielded no comment from Carlos A. Diaz, the agencys Southwest Border branch chief, though he pointed us by email to a 2017 Customs and Border Protection video describing enforcement actions from 1992 through 2016 to stem illegal crossings. The El Paso portion of the video doesnt mention fencing. Rather, it singles out the 285,000 apprehensions made in the El Paso sector in 1993--which a narrator says was the year that the Border Patrol implemented Operation Hold the Line at El Paso calling for the forward deployment of agents and technology to high-traffic areas. Focusing on prevention through deterrence, the narrator continues, the strategy proved successful and apprehensions decreased over 70 percent in the sector in one year and in 2015, 14,495 apprehensions were made in the El Paso sector. That snippet led us to revisit federal tallies of apprehensions, which show both a post-1986 high of 285,981 apprehensions in the sector in 1993 and a 72 percent plummet to 79,688 apprehensions in 1994 though apprehensions increased the next two years, reaching 145,929 in 1996. In subsequent years through September 2017, the sector reported decreased apprehensions in 13 years and increased apprehensions in eight years; its 25,193 apprehensions in 2017 amounted to the sectors third-most in a decade, possibly a reminder that economic conditions on both sides of the border, or unsafe conditions in parts of Central America, also can sway decisions to cross the Rio Grande. Other Border Patrol views When we asked, a couple of Border Patrol officers credited the El Paso fencing with enhancingenforcement. Doug Mosier, a Customs and Border Protection spokesman, said hes worked as an El Paso-based agency public affairs officer since 1986. By email, Mosier said Operation Hold The Line revolutionized the way that border security was conducted in terms of federal law enforcement prevention efforts. Mosier said Silvestre Reyes, later elected to the U.S. House, had tried a similar strategy on a smaller scale when he was a Border Patrol chief in McAllen, Texas, and it worked well for that community. According to a 2013 El Paso Times news story, the approach instigated by Reyes, described as still in place, called for the deployment of every available Border Patrol agent to different sites along 20 miles of the El Paso-Juarez border, roughly from Sunland Park, N.M., to the Zaragoza port of entry. Mosier elaborated to us: So, as the chief of El Paso Sector in 1993, he essentially positioned as many U.S. Border Patrol agents as he could spare (approximately 250 agents) along a primary 20-mile stretch of border separating El Paso/Juarez, over a three-week period. The result was astounding, since illegal apprehensions immediately dropped by approximately 80-percent overnight. Crime and loitering also fell by the wayside in the downtown district, which was later substantiated in several surveys and polls taken by the El Paso Times, and the then--El Paso Herald Post. At first the border community was in shock, but that soon gave way to widespread support which manifested in improved living conditions for residents in El Paso, and in some areas of N.M. The Times story said that after Hold the Line was implemented, Reyes went on to urge more strategic fencing. Mosier, asked to assess the effects of the fencing, said that when primary pedestrian fencing (18-feet) was implemented in 2008, it provided effective infrastructure in much-needed areas of the border. It also improved USBP effectiveness by better directing illegal immigration into areas where Border Patrol had more resources to monitor traffic via technology, aircraft, combined with increased agent personnel. We said at that time, and still say today, that those combined resources, our strong working relationship with law enforcement partners, and the support by residents in El Paso were essential to the success of El Paso border security efforts, Mosier said. Cordero, who also told us hes worked for the agency in the sector for 18 years, agreed the fencing helped reduce apprehensions but, he said, other enforcement activities and cooperation between law agencies and with Mexican authorities also mattered. Victor Manjarrez Jr. of the University of Texas at El Paso told us he was the sector chief when the fencing went up. By email, Manjarrez deemed the fencing a factor in driving down apprehensions along with increased Border Patrol personnel, expanded technology and infrastructure including lights and roads. Although the pedestrian wall had a huge impact, Manjarrez said, so did the increase in Border Patrol agents driven by a 2004 congressional directive to beef up the agency. I would disagree that the wall was the sole reason for the decline in criminal activity, but it was a MAJOR factor in improving the quality of life. El Paso crime Sperry wrote that FBI crime-rate information shows the fencing drove down crime in El Paso. In fact, Sperry wrote, El Paso before 2010 was mired in violent crime and drug smuggling, thanks in large part to illicit activities spilling over from the Mexican side. Once the fence went up, however, things changed almost overnight. His commentary also said: According to FBI tables, property crimes in El Paso have plunged more than 37 percent to 12,357 from their pre-fence peak of 19,702 a year, while violent crimes have dropped more than 6 percent to 2,682 from a peak of 2,861 a year. Moore countered in a post-publication tweet that El Pasos violent crime rate was on the slide long before the fencing got built. Our search of the Nexis news database showed too that the El Paso County sheriff, Richard Wiles, told a U.S. Senate committee in 2009 that by that year, El Paso had been considered one of the countrys safest cities for a dozen years, long before the new fence was built, Wiles testified. Moore, answering our request for more information, emailed us his spreadsheet suggesting that each year from 2000 through 2016, El Pasos violent crime rate based on FBI data far trailed the average violent crime rate for like cities of 500,000 to 1 million residents. The FBIs posted figures enabled us to confirm that El Pasos violent crime rate trailed the national average for cities of 500,000 to 1 million residents from 1985 through 2016. The citys rate also mostly decreased year to year, the figures indicate, though the city still saw 11 year-to-year increases with the biggest rate bump, 10 percent, occurring in 2008. Conversely, El Pasos rate sank 10 percent or more 10 times in the 30 years including 1994, 1995, 1998, 2000, 2002, 2003, 2005 and 2006--all before the new fencing was mandated or fully installed--with the other big drops occurring in 1987 and 2013. Drug smuggling Sperry wrote that drug smuggling at the El Paso border entry point has also fallen dramatically. In fact, since the fence was completed, the volume of marijuana and cocaine coming through El Paso and seized by Border Patrol agents has been cut in half. The year before the wall was fully built in 2010, Sperry went on, the volume of illegal drugs confiscated by the feds along the El Paso border hit 87,725 pounds. The year after, the amount of drug seizures plummeted to 43,783 pounds. Last year, they dropped even further to a total of 34,329, according to Border Patrol reports obtained by The Post. We found slightly different figures. Regardless, a chart provided by Cordero showed that the dollar amount of illegal drug seizures in the El Paso sector substantially declined from 2007 through 2014, when the agencys $35.2 million in seizures was more than 400 percent less than the nearly $151 million in seizures in 2006. While seizures escalated in 2015 and 2016, reaching $54 million, they declined to $39 million in 2017, the agencys chart says. Drug Seizures, El Paso Sector, U.S. Border Patrol, Fiscal 2006 though Fiscal 2017         SOURCE: Email, Ramiro Cordero, agent, U.S, Border Patrol, El Paso sector, Jan. 18, 2018 We later ran these mostly reduced interdictions of illegal drugs past Sanho Tree, director of the Drug Policy Project at the Institute for Policy Studies, which calls itself Washingtons first progressive multi-issue think tank. Tree said by phone he wasnt aware of research on the effect of the El Paso fencing on drug smuggling. Yet generally, Tree said, declines in captured drugs dont necessarily signal fall-offs in smuggling, which relies on frequent shifts in methodology extending to drones, tunnels, even catapults. What you interdict shows you what youre catching, it doesnt show what youre not catching, Tree said, adding that its hard to model the effects on smuggling of particular law enforcement tacks. Local police agencies didnt engage withthis fact-check. Sgt. Enrique Carrillo of the El Paso Police Department replied by email: We are not commenting on this. Our requests to interview Sheriff Wiles went unfulfilled. Our ruling Sperry wrote that the fencing finished near El Paso in 2010 dramatically curtailed illegal crossings, local crime and drug smuggling. Such crossings evidently plunged after the fencing was built (though they later rebounded a bit) and it could be that drug smuggling fell off as well. Yet this claim fails to account for El Paso's violent crime rate trending down long before the fencing went up nor does it acknowledge other factors affecting security including apre-1995 shift in enforcement strategy and stepped-up Border Patrol staffing.

The leaves are changing and so is Vermont.","A Saturday Night Live skit on September 29 spoofed Vermonts reputation as a Caucasian paradise with a fake meeting held by white supremacists. In response, Agency of Commerce and Community Development Secretary Michael Schirling sent SNL some Vermont flannel shirts Oct. 2 and responded to the shows creators that Vermont is becoming more racially diverse. We invite SNL viewers to Vermont to see all that we have to offer, including our increasingly diverse communities and wide array of tourist destinations including the African American Heritage Trail, said Schirling in the statement, which the department sent to Boston.com. Now is a perfect time to visit or to consider a move here. The leaves are changing and so is Vermont, he said. We decided to see if Schirling's statement was true, given that Vermont remains the second whitest state in the union. Is the state becoming more racially diverse? It turns out there has been a slight uptick in Vermont's non-white population. Schirling said he obtained his information from the U.S. Census Bureau. The Census Bureaus American Community Survey, a research project that produces population, demographic and housing estimates, indeed has found that Vermont is becoming more racially diverse, or at least less white. The survey found that Vermont was 95 percent white in 2013 and 94.2 percent white in 2017, a drop of 0.8 percent, according to a spokesperson for the American Community Survey. Within the category of non-white races in the Census data, there are many variations. From 2013 to 2017, the increase in the African-American population from 1.1 percent to 1.3 percent, was not statistically significant. But the percent change in the Asian and Hispanic populations was: Asians went from 1.2 percent of the Vermont population to 1.8 percent, a 0.6 percentage point increase; Hispanics went from 1.5 percent to 1.9 percent, a 0.4 percentage point increase. Our ruling The statement that Vermont is becoming increasingly diverse needs further clarification. Schirling does not explain that the increase in Vermont's racially diverse populations is slight.",0.7,0.4,0.9,0.5,0.3,0.2,0.6,0.8,0.6,Mostly True

Final Rating: Half True  ",Says Rick Scott cut Medicaid so people can't get Obamacare.,"It starts like a joke — Gov. Rick Scott walks into a Gainesville Starbucks — but one patron wasnt laughing. In town on April 5, 2016, to tour the recently opened factory and headquarters for biopharmaceutical company Nanotherapeutics, Scott stopped in to the coffee chain for a cup. Cara Jennings, a former Lake Worth city commissioner, saw Scott and ripped into him from her seat. Among other grievances, she accused him of denying her health care coverage with his policies. In fact, you cut Medicaid so I couldnt get Obamacare, Jennings shouted on April 5, 2016. You are an a------! You dont care about working people. You dont care about working people. You should be ashamed to show your face around here. When Scott countered that the state had created a million jobs since the recession, she said no one cared (read our fact-check on those jobs numbers). She then criticized his March signing of a bill denying funding for womens health care clinics that performed abortions (read our check about that issue). We tried to reach Jennings by phone, text, email and even Facebook, but we didnt hear back from her, so we dont really know the specifics of her situation. That makes it difficult to gauge whether she was able to benefit from the health care law. But we can look at whether Scott cut Medicaid, the joint state and federal program to provide health insurance for the very poor, in a way that could have denied people health coverage under the Affordable Care Act. Its not so much that he cut anything, but more that he hasnt consistently supported expanding the program. That has indeed left hundreds of thousands of Floridians without coverage. The expansion debate  Jennings told ABC Action News in Tampa after the incident that she is a single mother who worked part-time. That provides clues that she may fall into what is known as the Medicaid coverage gap. To understand why, lets review how the Affordable Care Act is linked to Medicaid. The law originally wanted to cover uninsured people two different ways. One was to subsidize people who needed help buying insurance through state marketplaces or HealthCare.gov. The second was to expand Medicaid to cover a higher number of poorer people. Normally, to be eligible for Medicaid, your annual income has to be 44 percent of the federal poverty level (100 percent is currently $11,880 for an individual and $24,300 for a family of four). The plan was to extend that eligibility to all adults up to 138 percent of the poverty level. Technically the calculation under the law is 133 percent, but a 5 percent deduction is added on top of that. But Medicaid expansion ended up being optional after a 2012 Supreme Court ruling saying it could not be forced upon states. Currently 19 states, including Florida, have chosen not to grow the program. Recent estimates from the Kaiser Family Foundation showed that 948,000 uninsured adults in Florida would be covered by an expansion. This has led to plenty of debate among lawmakers, including a meltdown during the 2015 Florida legislative session over how to cover more lower-income residents. The Senate was open to a limited expansion, while the House opposed it altogether. But now the math really starts to get tricky. If a state doesnt expand Medicaid, people who make 100 to 400 percent of the poverty level can get marketplace subsidies to buy private insurance. Because of the way the law was written, that leaves people making between 44 and 100 percent of the poverty level out in the cold, without assistance. Those people dont qualify for Medicaid, and cant get subsidies to buy insurance. Thats the so-called coverage gap. According to Kaiser, there are 567,000 people under that umbrella in the Sunshine State. Chances are good that a single mother working part time could fit into that definition. Scott, a former hospital chain executive best known for resigning amid controversy over his company defrauding Medicare, has had a spotty history with Medicaid. He initially opposed expanding the program under Obamacare, then supported it during his re-election campaign, then went back to opposing it. While the Legislature is the body that would have to approve an expansion, Scotts opinion affects the debate. (Scotts office did not respond to our questions about Medicaid.) He has argued with Washington over the federal government ending payments for low-income hospital patients, leaving the Legislature to use state money to plug holes in the program the last two years. Scott has also asked lawmakers to eliminate automatic increases to Medicaid hospital rates. Hes also overseen the states controversial transition to managed care, in which private companies took over Medicaid policies as a cost-cutting measure. Florida CHAIN, a consumer health advocacy group, told us managed care organizations had actually seen a boost in funding. And theres the aforementioned abortion bill Scott signed on March 25. That bill prevents state and Medicaid money from going to clinics that perform elective abortions, including Planned Parenthood affiliates. But these are specific issues not necessarily related to getting access to broad health care coverage under Obamacare. While many Floridians remain uninsured without Medicaid expansion, we found no evidence of an outright cut, as Jennings said. Our ruling The activist at Starbucks said Rick Scott cut Medicaid so people can't get Obamacare. Her point-blank accusation that Scott cut the program doesnt fit. But through Scotts inaction and the Florida House's resistance to expansion,many Floridians are not benefitting from either subsidies to buy private insurance or an expanded Medicaid.

Final Rating: Half True  ","When I was governor, not only did test scores improve – we also narrowed the achievement gap.","Mitt Romney heard both cheers and boos during his speech to the 2012 NAACP convention, where he vowed to help hundreds of millions of middle-class Americans of all races.While acknowledging the unlikelihood of a Republican addressing the group in the midst of a race against an African-American president, Romney nonetheless declared that he is the best candidate to help black Americans.The former Massachusetts governor touted his own record on several topics, including education. He said he intervened in failing schools, promoted math and science and strengthened testing standards.When I was governor, not only did test scores improve – we also narrowed the achievement gap, Romney, who served from 2003 to 2007, said.Romneys education record in Massachusetts is uncharted territory at PolitiFact, so we decided to check it out.A little on Massachusetts schoolsWe talked to several people knowledgeable about the school system in the Bay State, and all mentioned a 1993 landmark reform law that included the groundwork for the state accountability system (later called Massachusetts Comprehensive Assessment System, or MCAS), authorized charter schools and invested more money in local school districts. Its universal goal was to raise educational standards for all Massachusetts kids.Romney also referenced the reform in his speech to the NAACP on July 11, 2012:In the years before I took office our states leaders had come together to pass bipartisan measures that were making a difference. In reading and in math, our students were already among the best in the nation – and during my term, they took over the top spot. Those results revealed what good teachers can do if the system will only let them. The problem was, this success wasnt shared. A significant achievement gap between students of different races remained. So we set out to close it.This was all happening in a place where student achievement regularly leads the pack. Massachusetts, which has a disproportionately high number of colleges and universities, some of the nations wealthiest ZIP codes and a well-educated workforce, churns out many high performing students.But the glare of those top achievers makes the shadow of struggling students that much darker. That is to say, Massachusetts still has a significant achievement gap. The term refers to the disparity in performance between certain subsets of students. White, middle- and upper-class kids consistently do better in school than African-American and latino and low-income kids in the U.S.And in Massachusetts, because the kids at the top do so well, its that much harder for everybody else to catch up.Our scores are high, so as they get higher its pretty hard to move up, said Kathleen Skinner, a policy director at the Massachusetts Teachers Association, a teachers union.Narrowing the gapAs backup for the claim in Romneys speech, his campaign sent us a 2007 MCAS test results summary, and specifically pointed to 10th grade scores:10th Grade Proficiency In Matho 2005, White: 29%; Black: 19%. Gap = 10 pointso 2007, White: 29%; Black: 26%. Gap = 3 points10th Grade Proficiency In Englisho 2005, White: 46%; Black: 30%. Gap = 16 pointso 2007, White: 52%; Black: 40%. Gap = 12 pointsThat shows the achievement gap narrowing by 7 percentage points in math and by 4 percentage points in English.But the gains in other grades are smaller.Among eighth-graders, the gap tightened by only 1 point in math and 2 points in English. For seventh-graders, the change was 3 points in math, 5 points in English. Sixth grade: 1 point in math, no change in English. In fourth grade scores, the gap narrowed by 1 point in math and widened by 1 point in English. (Some of those are comparisons between 2006 scores and 2007, the only years provided in the test results summary.)Skinner pointed out an important point about the MCAS: 10th-graders have to pass it in order to graduate.They start paying attention, she said. We also took a look at scores for the following year, comparing the achievement gap between 2007 and 2008. (These charts offer a slightly different comparison from the previous year, which looked at students who scored proficient on each test. The 2007-08 chart includes those scoring proficient and higher.) The best gains again were made by 10th graders who narrowed the gap by six points in English. But there was no change in the gap in math scores, and lower grades showed only one- or two-point gains, or no improvement at all, and the gap widened in a couple of instances, such as eighth-grade science scores. The 2008-2009 test score summary reflected a similar trend: small gains in some subjects and small setbacks in others.Beverly Miyares, also with the Massachusetts Teachers Association, added that the dropout rate among black students in Massachusetts increased from 2002 to 2004, rising from 4.9 to 6.3.That means more under-performing students who dropped out of school didnt drag down the overall average test scores.Romneys roleIn claims such as this, we dont just consider the accuracy but also whether the speaker deserves credit: How responsible was Romney for narrowing the achievement gap?The most important point to make with Gov. Romneys record is that the reform he initiated was part of a much larger and longer movement that existed in Massachusetts, said Chad d'Entremont, executive director of the Rennie Center, which provides independent, nonpartisan research to inform public education reform in Massachusetts.Glenn Koocher, executive director with the Massachusetts Association of School Committees, which represents school boards, was less generous: He had nothing to do with it. Its the teachers in the classrooms who are making the difference.Skinner, the expert with the teachers union, added that Romney was a somewhat absent education governor. He was very agenda driven.We would argue that he didnt put anything in place to narrow the gap, she said.We also wondered whether Romney had pushed any initiatives specifically aimed at helping minority students. Koocher and Skinner both mentioned charter schools, which are favored by many Republicans.The charter school program was always popular among minority parents (and) any parents that wanted to get their kids out of the public schools, Koocher said, adding that vouchers commonly used to pay tuition at charter schools are unconstitutional in Massachusetts. Instead, the per-pupil state spending is deducted from the public school districts budget.Ryan Williams, spokesman for the Romney campaign, said protecting the 1993 reform legislation was an important effort by Romney. He said there were attempts to repeal the graduation requirement, and Romney stood firm on that and did not back down.It was one of the bigger things we had success in blocking, Williams said. A lot of what Romney did when he was governor was to preserve that legislation. He said, Im not going to roll these standards back. Skinner mentioned another, perhaps less obvious, initiative from Romney that helped many minority students: universal health care. Romney signed a health care reform law in Massachusetts that led to a 98 percent coverage rate.In Massachusetts, all of our kids have health insurance, and I dont think anybody should underestimate the impact that has on learning. Our kids get vaccinated, they can go to the dentist, they can go to the eye doctor, she said. Their health is less of an issue than it is in other places.Our rulingRomney told the NAACP that when he was governor of Massachusetts, not only did test scores improve – we also narrowed the achievement gap.State education figures over two years support Romneys claim about learning gains, although its worth noting that some areas declined on his watch, such as the drop-out rate. And its always somewhat dubious to take a snapshot of statistics from only one or two years, when, as d'Entremont said significant gains in student achievement dont happen overnight, and the gains in Massachusetts are the result of a 20-year reform effort.Whats more, Romney, a single-term governor, should not get all the credit for improvement in the achievement gap, which is influenced by myriad factors.His statement is partially accurate but omits a lot of important information and overstates his impact.",0.5,0.5,1,0.5,0,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,Half True

Final Rating: Half True  ",You have areas of Pennsylvania that are barely affected and [the governor wants] to keep them closed.,"After touring an Allentown warehouse filled with protective medical equipment, President Donald Trump criticized Gov. Tom Wolf for keeping parts of Pennsylvania closed that the president thinks are no longer threatened by the coronavirus. You have areas of Pennsylvania that are barely affected and [the governor wants] to keep them closed, Trump told a crowd of workers from Owens & Minor, a company that manufactures and distributes masks, gloves and gowns to health care workers, on May 14. We wondered whether the statewide stay-at-home order Wolf issued on April 1 still applies to places hardly impacted by the deadly disease. It all depends what criteria are used to determine whether the coronavirus still poses a threat. The virus is still raging across Southeastern Pennsylvania, and not even Trump is arguing that Philadelphia and its suburbs are ready to reopen. Officials in Delaware and Bucks counties, however, have asked Wolf to exclude their nursing-home populations when he eventually rates their readiness. Largely when you look across the state, the hardest hit area has been the Southeast of Pennsylvania, said Dr. David Rubin, director of PolicyLab at Childrens Hospital of Philadelphia, which has been tracking the differences in the outbreak across individual regions of the country. The Philadelphia area as far west as Lancaster, Berks and Dauphin counties, and north to the Lehigh Valley have seen some of the worst outbreaks in Pennsylvania, he said. Largely the rest of the state has had a pretty deceptively, sort of minimal experience with COVID, Rubin said. That includes Allegheny County, the rural T and the South, Central and Southwestern parts of the state. When you have someone in that area of the state that are upset that they are unable to work, theyre not wrong, Rubin said. But for those in the Southeast worried about a resurgence, theyre not wrong, either. Wolf has already moved 37 Pennsylvania counties into what he calls the yellow phase of reopening. In these places, many businesses may resume in-person operations, and residents may leave their homes so long as they take precautions. Thirteen counties in Southwestern Pennsylvania moved into the yellow phase May 15. Twenty-four others in the Northern half of the state entered yellow May 8. Another 12 counties will move into yellow on May 22. Counties in the red phase of Wolfs reopening plan are still under lockdown, with stay-at-home orders in place and all but essential businesses closed. Counties that eventually make it to the green phase will ask businesses and individuals to follow Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and State Department of Health guidelines for limiting the spread of the virus but will otherwise have no restrictions. Yellow counties gyms, hair salons, and schools must remain closed, and gatherings of more than 25 people are prohibited. Even still, yellow is the distinction several other Central and Eastern Pennsylvania counties are clamoring for. A key factor that determines whether a county qualifies for yellow privileges is whether it has fewer than 50 new reported coronavirus cases per 100,000 residents over a period of 14 days. The number of people sickened with the virus in Lancaster, Lebanon, Dauphin, Franklin and Schuylkill counties disqualifies them from entering the yellow phase. But that fact didnt stop local leaders from announcing plans to reopen businesses anyway – with or without Wolfs blessing. In a series of letters and tweets, the officials, including state lawmakers and county commissioners, begged Wolf to allow local businesses to reopen and better position themselves to survive the crisis. Officials from Dauphin, Franklin and Schuylkill counties later backed down. Lebanon officials are set to vote on reopening today. Lancaster officials held a news conference on the issue Thursday night but did not say what they will do. Counties reversed course after Wolf called them cowardly and selfish and threatened to withhold their federal stimulus funds if they directed businesses and residents to defy his order. Until recently, another nine counties found themselves in limbo. They had reported fewer than 50 cases per 100,000 residents over a 14-day period, but until May 15, when Wolf announced plans to move them into the yellow phase soon, they remained stuck in the red zone, which requires businesses to stay closed and residents to continue sheltering at home. Those counties include: York, Adams, Perry, Juniata, Mifflin, Carbon, Wyoming, Susquehanna and Wayne. Officials from York and Adams counties had been especially vocal about their frustration that businesses had not been cleared to reopen. Some officials said they didnt understand what was holding them back, given their success keeping coronavirus case counts relatively low. Wolf had been asked about the discrepancy several times in recent days before he announced plans to move the counties into yellow by May 22, and his explanations lacked clarity. We had to read a 7,000 word Wolf administration document titled Process to Reopen Pennsylvania to figure it out. A countys coronavirus case count is not the only piece of information Wolfs team uses to determine when its ready to move into the yellow phase. Hes said this publicly, but on recent calls with the press, he hasnt listed the other factors that matter. Carnegie Mellon University researchers advising the state compiled the list and rated counties in each category. According to the document, the other factors are: A countys ability to meet a surge in demand for intensive care. A countys density. The share of county residents who are over age 60. The share of county residents who work in physically closed industry sectors, such as nursing homes. When those pieces are considered, it appears York County was held back from reopening because of its population density, and Adams County was ordered to stay closed because it has an insufficient number of intensive care unit beds. Mifflin, Juniata, Perry, Carbon, Susquehanna and Wayne counties were also flagged because of limited ICU capacity. We had to click through a link tucked at the bottom of a May 8 press release to find a May 7 PowerPoint presentation detailing how each Pennsylvania county rates on the Carnegie Mellon risk assessment scale. Its unclear if county officials calling to have their stay-at-home orders lifted know where to find their own ratings. Wyoming County in the Northeast corner of the state has a small number of coronavirus cases and doesnt rate as high risk in any of the other categories. Before Wolf announced that Wyoming County would move into the yellow phase by May 22, it was unclear why Wolf wouldnt allow businesses there to reopen. County officials had announced plans to reopen without Wolfs approval and later backed down. In the Process to Reopen Pennsylvania document, the state cautioned that the reopening process will be fluid and that the Carnegie Mellon rating system is not designed to make decisions but rather to inform decision makers. Trump said that Wolf wants to keep parts of Pennsylvania closed that have been barely affected by the coronavirus. Trump was likely speaking about counties in Central and Eastern Pennsylvania like Lebanon and Lancaster whose Republican lawmakers have been clamoring for more freedom even though their coronavirus case counts remain relatively high. Those places have not been barely affected. Theyre battling active outbreaks. Trump was right, though, that until May 15, Wolf wanted to keep closed nine counties with relatively few cases.",0.5,0.5,1,0.5,0,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,Half True

Final Rating: Mostly True  ","In cutting greenhouse gas emissions, the United States is the leader in the world by far.","The latest United Nations climate change report had a grim forecast: If greenhouse gas emissions dont peak within three years, then theres little hope of limiting the global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius. Sen. Dan Sullivan, R-Alaska,says one of the best moves the United States could make is to accelerate the shift in places such as China and India from coal to natural gas. Sullivan has a plan to increase American natural gas production, liquify it and ship it overseas. His key supporting argument is the hefty 14% drop in American carbon dioxide emissions over the last 15 years. If every other country in the world had a record like this, where do you think we would be on global emissions? Sullivan said at a March 23 Senate hearing. We are the leader in the world by far. Whether the U.S. is the world leader in cutting emissions depends on how you measure things. In total metric tons, Sullivan is right. But in relative terms, many economic peers achieved steeper declines. At the Senate hearing, Sullivan displayed a chart showing the change in carbon dioxide emissions in nine countries between 2005 and 2020. The U.S. stands out with a fall between those years of 970 million metric tons of carbon dioxide. Japans emissions went down 237 million metric tons. China, on the other hand, released an additional 4,689 million metric tons in 2020 than it did in 2005, while Indias emissions rose 1,315 million metric tons. Chart used by Sen. Dan Sullivan, R-Alaska, to show carbon dioxide emission trends for nine countries. (Office of Dan Sullivan) Sullivans staff pulled these numbers from the website Our World in Data, a reliable resource based at the University of Oxford in England. The numbers are accurate, although climate trackers warn against including 2020 numbers, because the COVID-19 economic shutdown distorted normal emission patterns. In our analysis, we looked at 2005 to 2019. The first caveat to Sullivans approach is that he uses absolute numbers. Rob Jackson, an earth systems professor at Stanford University, said the chart is conveniently misleading. The United States has the largest reduction because, in 2005, Jackson said, it had the highest emissions. Other countries, in Europe in particular, have done far more than we have to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, Jackson said. Looking at the percentage change in carbon dioxide emissions, the United Kingdom made the greatest progress, with a reduction of 35%. Italy, France and Germany came next. The United States and Japan tied for fifth place with reductions of about 14%.  Sullivan spokesman Ben Dietderich agreed that the relative changes reshuffled the rankings, but he countered that the absolute number of tons mattered most. Its the tons of carbon dioxide that affect the global climate, he said. At the end of the day, Dietderich said, the United States made the largest contribution to reducing carbon dioxide emissions. Jackson raised another issue with Sullivans chart — it left out emissions per person. Chinas emissions are enormous, but the country also has 1.4 billion people. Viewed through that lens, despite the decline in U.S. emissions, the United States remained the larger emitter per capita. Our per capita emissions are still twice Chinas and eight times higher than Indias, Jackson said.  Sullivans focus on carbon dioxide doesnt give the full picture of American emissions. There are other greenhouse gases, most importantly methane and nitrous oxide. The same website that provided the carbon dioxide numbers also has data for greenhouse gases across the board. Factoring in all greenhouse gases, the U.S. trends are less dramatic. The total decline goes from a reduction of 879 million metric tons to 607 million metric tons. As a percentage, the decline goes from 14.3% for carbon dioxide alone to 9.5% for all greenhouse gases combined. The numbers work that way because it doesnt take much of those other gases to put a lot of carbon into the air. Although natural gas was the single largest factor in cutting U.S. emissions, major contributions also came from the rise in wind power and efficiency gains in American industry that lowered demand. Sullivans point was that if other countries followed the United States lead, global emissions would fall. Since the blossoming of natural gas production played a large role in the U.S., it makes sense, he said, to expand production further and export to coal-burning countries such asChina and India. Not so fast, say energy researchers. Michael Young, a senior scientist at the University of Texas at Austin, said building the pipelines and processing plants to send natural gas overseas adds carbon to the atmosphere. Its possible, Young said, that exports to Asia could reduce emissions there if they replaced coal or wood. But its also true that liquified natural gas from the U.S. will embed carbon dioxide emissions in the production and transportation of the fuel, reducing the benefits, Young said. Whether the two balance out depends on many factors. Ben King, a senior analyst at Rhodium Group, a private research center, said although industry is getting better at preventing the release of methane gas, it still happens in the liquefaction process. More troubling, King said, is that building new plants to export natural gas is a 30-year investment. Locking in long-lived fossil fuel assets runs directly counter to the need, recently affirmed in the latest International Panel on Climate Change report, to quickly transition away from uncontrolled fossil fuel use, King said. Sullivan said the United States is the leader in the world by far in cutting greenhouse gas emissions. In absolute terms, that is accurate —but it isnt telling the full story. Relative to the scale of emissions in other leading economies, other countries show much deeper reductions. Sullivan also left out emissions per person in the United States. Although those have dropped, theyre still about twice as high as they are in China.",0.7,0.6,1.0,0.5,0.0,0.5,0.4,0.9,0.6,Mostly True

Final Rating: Mostly True  ",Says the Koch Brothers sponsored a study that shows that Medicare for All would save the American people $2 trillion over a 10-year period.,"When a free-market think tank published its analysis of Sen. Bernie Sanders single-payer health care plan, Republicans took to social media to tout the reports most eye-popping finding. Sanders Medicare for All would cost $32.6 trillion over 10 years, an amount they framed as crushingly large. $32.6 trillion dollars. Thats how much Washington Democrats single-payer healthcare proposal would cost over 10 years. Even doubling all federal individual and corporate income taxes wouldnt cover this cost. It is just absurd. https://t.co/8jijG73wEw Sanders, however, found good news for his idea in the generally skeptical report. In a video he shared on social media July 30, he pointed out one of the reports findings that others had overlooked. Sanders tweaked the Koch brothers, the conservative donor family that has supported the Mercatus Center at George Mason University in Virginia. Sanders said, Let me thank the Koch Brothers of all people for sponsoring a study that shows that Medicare for All would save the American people $2 trillion over a 10-year period.  That is what is in the study of the Mercatus Center. Thank you, Koch brothers, for accidentally making the case for Medicare for All! pic.twitter.com/speuEL6ETC Sanders plan would essentially expand Medicare to cover everyone, rather than just those older than 65. Individuals (and their employers) would no longer need to shoulder co-pays for medical care or premiums for private insurance coverage. Instead, the government would pay everyones medical bills. Sanders and his allies say this would end up saving money, because it would remove the middle-man of insurance companies, which drive up administrative costs, and and enable the government to use new bargaining power to rein in costs by providers. Skeptics counter that those savings are not guaranteed, and the lack of a monetary incentive for patients to hold back on services could lead to increased use of the system, adding to the overall cost. In addition, with the government having to raise revenue to pay everyones bills, taxes and the federal debt could go dangerously high, potentially canceling out or exceeding the money that individuals and families would save in higher take-home pay and lower health-care expenses. In this article, well look at something much more narrow: whether Sanders is right that the Mercatus report says that single-payer would save the United States $2 trillion in health care outlays. In a way, Sanders is right, though his assertion glosses over some caveats. The Mercatus report included a table summarizing the financial effects of Sanders bill. With a minimum of arithmetic, its not hard to find the $2 trillion in question. Its the difference between the Department of Health and Human Services projection of the amount of total health care spending in the United States, and what Mercatus thinks that number would be under Sanders Medicare for All proposal. (See Table 2.) Under Mercatus projection for Medicare for All, the total amount of health expenditures would actually fall compared to what is expected under a continuation of the current system. Specifically, total health care expenditures would fall by $2.054 trillion over 10 years, according to Mercatus. So theres definitely something to what Sanders said. The Mercatus reports author took issue with Sanders focus on that figure. Charles Blahous said that to come up with that estimate, Mercatus used a relatively generous assumption about how well Sanders plan will end up controlling health care costs. It assumes that provider payment will be reduced to Medicare levels, that negotiation with prescription drugmakers will generate significant savings, and that administrative costs will be cut from 13 to 6 percent. However, in an alternative scenario in which cost-control works less effectively (see Table 4) Mercatus found that over the same 10-year period, national health expenditures would actually increase by $3.252 trillion compared to current law. So while the number Sanders chose really does appear in the report, hes cherry-picked the more flattering of two estimates. Sanders bill indicates that health providers would be paid at Medicares payment rates, which are about 40 percent lower than those paid by private insurance, Blahous said. Obviously, immediately cutting payments to health care providers by roughly 40 percent would lower national health spending. But would cuts that large actually occur (and without other negative consequences, such as mass retirements of doctors unwilling to accept lower fees)? This is where independent experts express caution. Sustained cuts as deep as those projected in the Mercatus model Sanders pointed to are not likely feasible, said John Holahan, a fellow in the health policy center at the Urban Institute. His Urban Institute colleague, Linda Blumberg, agreed, saying its a pretty heroic assumption to say that you can dial payment rates down to those levels system-wide politically. In addition, even if the switch to Medicare for All does end up cutting the total amount of money spent on health care in the United States, the legislation places more of those costs on the federal budget. In an era of rising debt and an aging Baby Boom generation, that could be a problem. Josh Miller-Lewis, a spokesman for Sanders, focused instead on the impact on individuals, many of whom will end up ahead. Under Medicare for All with a progressive tax system, the vast majority of people will save money on health care, he said. In cheekily thanking the Koch brothers, Sanders said a study they indirectly sponsored shows that Medicare for All would save the American people $2 trillion over a 10-year period. The $2 trillion figure can be traced back to the Mercatus report. But it is one of two scenarios the report offers, so Sanders use of the term would is too strong. The alternative figure, which assumes that a Medicare for All plan isnt as successful in controlling costs as its sponsors hope it will be, would lead to an increase of almost $3.3 trillion in national health care expenditures, not a decline. Independent experts say the alternative scenario of weaker cost control is at least as plausible.",1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,Mostly True

Final Rating: Half True  ",Says 92 percent of the people agree on DACA.,"President Donald Trump has questioned why undocumented immigrants who came to the United States as children should be deported, a sharp departure from the campaign when he advocated for the removal of all who were violating immigration laws. Trumps administration is phasing out Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA), an Obama-era program that shields young undocumented immigrants from deportation. At the same time, Trump wants Congress to pass a permanent solution for the so-called Dreamers, saying the idea has very high support among Americans. (DACA recipients are commonly called Dreamers.) Look, 92 percent of the people agree on DACA, but what we want is we want very, very powerful border security, Trump said Sept. 14 before traveling from Washington to meet with Floridians affected by Hurricane Irma. He said Republican congressional leaders were also on board. Later in Florida, he said they were not looking at amnesty or citizenship, but looking at allowing people to stay here. If and when funding for Trumps border wall will come or what will be part of a DACA deal is still unclear. For now, we were curious about Trumps claim that 92 percent of people agree on a solution for DACA recipients. We did not find a poll showing support that high, but several polls do show that the majority of Americans want a favorable outcome for Dreamers. The White House declined to comment for this fact-check. We found several polls that asked about DACA and showed majority support for not deporting Dreamers. But we did not find nearly universal support that Trump described. • A Morning Consult and Politico poll conducted between Sept. 7-11, after the Trump administration announced it was eliminating DACA, found that of 1,976 registered voters polled, 45 percent said it was the wrong thing to do; 35 percent said it was the right thing to do; 20 percent did not know or had no opinion. Asked about the issue in a different way — When it comes to legislation regarding Dreamers, which of the following would you most like Congress to pass? — 54 percent of respondents said they would want legislation that allowed Dreamers to stay and become citizens if they met certain requirements; 19 percent favored legislation that would allow them to stay legally but not become citizens, if they met certain requirements; 12 percent wanted legislation that removes or deports them; and 15 percent did not know or had no opinion. So, for this second question, 73 percent favored legislation that would protect Dreamers from deportation. A previous Morning Consult and Politico poll, conducted from April 20-24 asked about 2,000 registered voters what they thought was the best way to handle Dreamers. Fifty-six percent said they should be allowed to stay and become citizens if they met certain requirements, and 22 percent favored allowing them to stay and become legal residents, but not citizens, if they met certain requirements. Overall, 78 percent definitely did not want Dreamers to be deported. • An NBC News and SurveyMonkey poll, conducted online from August 24-29 among a national sample of 10,129 adults, found 64 percent support for DACA. • A Sept. 3-5 poll from The Economist and YouGov of 1,500 U.S. adults also found that 55 percent of responders somewhat or strongly supported DACA, though support for the program was lower among Trump voters and Republicans. Several polling and public opinion experts we reached out to say they were not aware of any recent poll showing a 92 percent support for DACA, but that a solid majority does seem to favor the program. Trump said92 percent of the people agree on DACA. We found several polls in which a majority of people said they supported DACA or favored legislation that would allow Dreamers to stay in the United States. But the level of support was not as high as 92 percent.",0.5,0.5,1,0.5,0,0.2,0.4,1,0.6,Half True

Final Rating: Half True  ",Wisconsin children are crossing condemned bridges in the middle of the winter to get to the school bus.,"Saying Wisconsins transportation needs are urgent, state Sen. Kathleen Vinehout, a potential candidate for governor in 2018, made an alarming claim. We have bridges in my own county that have been condemned, the Alma Democrat said Feb. 24, 2017 on Wisconsin Public Television. And we still have school children that are crossing those condemned bridges in the middle of the winter to get to the school bus. An unsettling image for rural Buffalo County, which is three hours northwest of Madison. We found there are two bridges in the county so badly damaged that they are closed to vehicle traffic, though only one of them is traversed by children to get to and from their school bus. And the word condemned, while accurate in a colloquial sense, exaggerates the danger to kids. Bridge worries The need for improvements on Wisconsins bridges has gained attention in the past couple of years, even if the terms used to describe their condition might mean less than they seem. Structurally deficient means suffering from deterioration to at least one major component, but not unsafe. Functionally obsolete means built using outdated standards, such as older design features. Wisconsins figure has risen to 15 percent, according to a 2017 report by the American Road & Transportation Builders Association, with 1,232 bridges deficient and 783 obsolete. How to pay for bridge work has been a persistent issue. A January 2017 audit by the nonpartisan state Legislative Audit Bureau noted that in a 2015 survey done by the bureau, only 50 percent of county highway commissioners said money for routine maintenance on bridges was adequate. Meanwhile, Republican Gov. Scott Walker and the GOP-majority Legislature, as they work on Walkers state budget proposal for 2017-19, are debating about new taxes or other ways of funding road and bridge work. Buffalo County To check Vinehouts claim, we called Buffalo County Highway Commissioner Bob Platteter. He said flooding caused by an August 2016 storm damaged the 125-foot Schoepps Valley Bridge, which spans Waumandee Creek, beyond repair. Its scrap, he said. The bridge was closed to vehicle traffic, so in that sense it could be considered condemned, Platteter told us -- but it was judged safe for pedestrian crossing, which continued until demolition began nearly seven months later, in March 2017. Nearby residents would drive their children to the bridge and the kids walked over it to catch the school bus, he said. And to avoid a detour of up to 20 miles, some residents with multiple vehicles parked one on the road on one side of the bridge and one on the other side. Platteter said a new timber bridge is expected to be installed by the end of April 2017. The Highway U bridge in Buffalo County partially collapsed one evening in February 2017, causing accidents two accidents that injured both drivers, though neither needed treatment.The collapse likely was also because of flood damage, Platterer said. That bridge is also now open only to pedestrians. But school buses use other county roads to pick up and drop off children in that area, he said. Our rating Vinehout says Wisconsin children are crossing condemned bridges in the middle of the winter to get to the school bus. Two bridges in Vinehouts home county of Buffalo have been condemned in that they are too badly damaged for any vehicle traffic. But officials have determined that they remain safe for pedestrians, and children do use one of the bridges to get to and from their school bus.

Final Rating: Half True  ","In Texas, we've had three ISIS-related incidents already.","After the recent terrorist attacks in France, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott was among governors declaring they would not accept Syrian refugees because of a potential for terrorism. Abbott appeared on The Real Story, a Fox News program, on Nov.17, 2015, to explain his stance on keeping refugees out of Texas because of security concerns. We've had three ISIS-related incidents already and now with the possible connection of one of the Syrian refugees being involved in the terrorist attack in Paris, Abbott said, Texas is saying 'no more.  We wondered whether Texas was really the site of so many ISIS plots. Abbott spokesman John Wittman pointed us to a letter from Abbott to Obama dated Nov. 16, 2015, which said: The threat posed to Texas by ISIS is very real. ISIS claimed credit last May when two terrorist gunmen launched an attack in Garland, Texas. Less than two weeks later, the FBI arrested an Iraqi-born man in North Texas and charged him with lying to federal agents about traveling to Syria to fight with ISIS. The letter went on to say that in 2014, when I served as Texas attorney general, we participated in a Joint Terrorism Task Force that arrested two Austin residents for providing material support to terrorists -- including ISIS. To determine if Abbott got his facts straight, we looked at each of the incidents. An Austin-area arrest and conviction Some of this was old ground for us. In September 2014, when Abbott was the state attorney general also running for governor, he claimed hed been involved in prosecuting a terrorist member of ISIS. We found that claim False; Abbott offered no evidence to back up his declaration aside from a press release crediting a range of agencies including the attorney general as well as the Killeen Police Department and Texas Alcoholic Beverage Commission. Abbotts statement also relied on a broad definition of terrorist and ISIS member. A federal complaint indicated Michael Todd Wolfe of Austin may have sought to be those things. But the complaint didnt confirm hed become a terrorist or ISIS member. In the case in question, Wolfe and Rahatul Khan of Round Rock, Texas, were charged with attempting to provide material support to terrorists. Wolfe had tried to board an international flight out of George Bush Intercontinental Airport that would take him to the first stop on a planned journey to Syria. In June 2015, Wolfe was sentenced to seven years in prison for attempting to provide material support to terrorists. According to the criminal complaint, Khan attempted to recruit an undercover FBI agent to a terrorist cell over the Internet. He was sentenced to 10 years imprisonment. The pipeline was affiliated with al-Shabaab — the al-Qaeda-linked Somali militant group behind the mass slaying of Christian students at a Kenyan university earlier this year—not ISIS. Abbotts second described incident In his 2015 letter to Obama, Abbott also referenced concerns about Bilal Abood, the Iraqi-born man in North Texas. Court documents show Abood migrated to the United States in 2009, and offer the following account of his subsequent movement and activities: On March 29, 2013, FBI agents prevented Abood from boarding a flight at Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport. He told them he was planning to visit family. Interviewed a second time five days later, Abood said his intent was to join the Free Syrian Army (FSA) in the struggle against Bashar al-Assad, the president of Syria. Later in April 2013, Abood travelled to Turkey via Mexico, on or about April 29. Agents again interviewed Abood upon his return to the United States on Sept. 16, 2013. He admitted he had travelled to Syria and stayed in an FSA camp, but denied financially supporting any terrorist group. A search of Aboods computer in July 2014 found that he had tweeted a pledge of allegiance to Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the leader of ISIS, on June 19, 2014. He later denied pledging allegiance to ISIS and was arrested for making a materially false, fictitious and fraudulent statement and representation, in a matter within the jurisdiction of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Abbotts letter mischaracterizes the nature of Aboods offense; he wrote that Abood was charged with lying to federal agents about traveling to Syria to fight with ISIS, not lying about a tweet. Shootings in Garland The third incident referenced by Abbott was the Garland, Texas, shooting scheme attempted by Elton Simpson and Nadir Soofi on May 5, 2015. According to a criminal complaint the FBI later filed against a Florida man who claimed to have encouraged the attack, the two planned to shoot attendees at a contest centered around cartoons of the prophet Muhammad (drawing the prophet Muhammad is forbidden in Islam). However, they were shot and killed outside the event by police. This incident is the only foiled attack included in a Department Homeland Security analysis of all ISIS-related arrests on United States soil from January 2014 to September 2015 (the other cases were unsuccessful and successful attempts to travel to fight with ISIS, provide material support to ISIS, and engage in early stage aspirational attack planning). In the aftermath of the shooting, ISIS claimed credit. However, by the time Abbott made his claim, investigators had yet to issue any statement characterizing the Garland attack as having been ordered by members of ISIS. Simpson was involved in terrorist causes before ISIS even split off from Al-Qaeda. He was arrested by the FBI in 2010 after discussing jihad and potential travel to Somalia with an informant the previous year. Allison Mahan, an FBI spokeswoman in Dallas, told us via email, The Garland attackers were ISIS-inspired and the investigation is ongoing. ISIS-inspired terrorist attacks are much more common than attacks directly ordered by members of the group, according to an analysis published in the October 2015 issue of the Terrorism Research Initiatives Perspectives on Terrorism. The TRI is an international consortium of scholars founded in 2007 to facilitate security studies research. Our ruling In his opposition to resettlement of Syrian refugees in Texas, Gov. Greg Abbott said he was concerned about potential terrorism from devotees to the Islamic State. In Texas, Abbott said, we've had three ISIS-related incidents already. Abbottis on solid ground with one Islamic State-related incident — the Garland shooting plot. In other Texas arrests related tothe group, he uses the term incident to cover things including lying about a tweet and trying to travel to Syria.

Final Rating: Mostly True  ",Youve got almost twice as many cops in New York City as you do on our entire border. Thats nuts.,"Asked whether Texas needs to follow Arizonas lead and enact a hard-line immigration law, Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst said in a May 12 interview with the Texas Tribune that he was more interested in a long-term solution to illegal immigration: securing the border.Claiming the federal government had done virtually nothing to address the situation, Dewhurst said border operations conducted by local sheriffs departments, local police departments, the state and our federal partners had taught the following lesson: At the end of the day, [even with] all of the technology in the world, you need people.To emphasize his personnel point, Dewhurst compared the number of U.S. Border Patrol agents to the number of police officers in the nations largest city, New York. Youve got almost twice as many cops in New York City as you do on our entire border, Dewhurst said. Thats nuts.Nutty, maybe.But does Dewhurst's statement reflect reality?Answering our query, his office provided figures from the New York Police Department indicating that it has about 34,500 officers and from U.S. Customs and Border Protection that the Border Patrol has about 19,100 agents on the northern and southern U.S. borders. The Border Patrol is part of the U.S. Customs and Border Protection division of the federal Department of Homeland Security.We checked, and those figures stand up. The website for the New York Police Department says the agency's current uniformed strength is approximately 34,500. And Steven Cribby, a spokesman for U.S. Customs and Border Protection, said the Border Patrol numbers about 20,000 -- 17,000 of whom are stationed on the U.S-Mexico border. An additional 2,100 employees are on the border with Canada, with the rest patrolling coastal waters, primarily near Puerto Rico.Counting only the border agents that work the southern and northern borders, the NYPD force is about 81 percent larger than the Border Patrol, almost twice the size, as Dewhurst says. (That calculation leaves out the Border Patrol agents who work coastal waters. If you add those, the New York force is 73 percent larger.)We wondered, though, if it's reasonable to compare cops working the nation's biggest city to officers monitoring our international borders.We put that question to several law enforcement and criminal justice experts, including Samuel Walker, professor emeritus of criminal justice at the University of Nebraska at Omaha. His assessment: The comparison of the NYPD and the Border Patrol is completely wrong, given their very different roles and working environments.Walker's point, which we heard separately from other experts: The two organizations have dramatically different missions and environments. The New York Police Department responds to calls for service from the citys more than 8 million residents and numerous visitors, while fighting all kinds of crime, in a dense urban area. In contrast, the experts said, the Border Patrol has much narrower responsibilities, which they have to fulfill across vast spaces -- much of it sparsely populated.Since the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks, the agencys primary mission has been to prevent terrorists and terrorist weapons from entering the country, Cribby said. Agents are also tasked with preventing undocumented immigrants from entering the country illegally and stopping drug and human trafficking along the border between the legal ports of entry.Even comparing staffing levels of different police departments can be tricky. The usual basis for comparison is the number of sworn officers per 1,000 residents. Those ratios vary widely across the country and even from city to city. Based on the most recent numbers available, New York's ratio in 2008 was 4.3 officers per 1,000 residents; the national rate was 2.5.Its often like comparing apples to carburetors because there is so much difference in how departments use people, said Craig Fraser, director of management services for the Police Executive Research Forum, a nonprofit research and consulting group in Washington. In some cities, police officers do jobs that are performed by civilian personnel elsewhere. Some police departments have fewer officers because other local law enforcement agencies, like a sheriffs office, pick up slack.It's even trickier to compare agencies with such different duties as the Border Patrol and the New York Police Department, as Dewhurst did.So where does all of this leave his statement?The lieutenant governor accurately characterizes the relative sizes of two law enforcement agencies -- the Border Patrol and the New York Police Department. He may have a point that the border needs more federal agents -- though there is disagreement over whether more boots on the ground will prevent illegal immigration -- but comparing the size of that force to the cops in the Big Apple is not a valid way to prove it.",1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,Mostly True

Hillary Clinton pumped up the state's role in the presidential election at a campaign stop in Logan. If West Virginia had voted for our Democratic nominee in 2000 and 2004, we wouldn't have had to put up with George Bush for the last 7 years, she said May 12, 2008, as reported by MSNBC.com's First Read blog. I am going to work as hard as I can between now and the time the polls close tomorrow, because I want to earn your support. Really? Five electoral college votes from a state of nearly 2-million people could have prevented the George W. Bush administration? Here we thought it was 537 popular votes in Florida. Turns out, Clinton is half right. In the bitterly contested election of 2000, Bush won the state of West Virginia with 336,475 votes to Vice President Al Gore's 295,497. That earned Bush 5 electoral college votes. Now, Bush won the electoral college — and the presidency — 271-266. Funny how that's a 5-vote difference. If you subtract 5 electoral college votes from Bush's total, and add 5 electoral college votes to Gore's total, indeed the result is flipped, 271-266, in Gore's favor. And the world embraces the climate change crisis years earlier. (Of course, many would argue a more significant factor was Florida's 27 electoral votes — in dispute until Dec. 12, 2000, when the Supreme Court ruled in favor of Bush, saying it was too late for another recount.) The 2004 election is another matter completely. On the simple question of the math, Clinton is wrong. Bush defeated Sen. John Kerry, the Democratic nominee, 286-251 in the electoral college. West Virginia's 5 votes wouldn't have put a dent in Bush's 35-vote margin. But there's something incongruous about Clinton extending her argument to include the 2004 election. If Gore had won in 2000, then Bush almost certainly wouldn't have been running against Kerry in 2004 and who knows what the electoral map would have looked like in a Gore re-election race. Clinton is right that Bush wouldn't be president if West Virginia had gone for Gore in 2000. That alone would have prevented 7 years of a Bush administration. By raising the 2004 election, though, Clinton ruins her perfectly accurate argument. Suggesting that West Virginia voters had the same chance to defeat Bush in 2004 that they had in 2000 is just wrong, which is how we end up at Half True.

Final Rating: Mostly True  ",Illegal border crossings are up 173% from 1 year ago and 28% since January when President Biden stopped the wall & deportations and started catch & release.,"A North Carolina congressman says the number of crossings at the U.S.-Mexico border has doubled and that President Bidens policies are to blame. Republican Richard Hudson spoke about immigration with Fox News in a segment posted online March 15. The reason were having this Biden border surge is because hes reversed these policies, as you say. He stopped building the wall. He put a halt on deportations and he brought back catch and release, he said. He later tweeted those same talking points. Democrats are trying to shift blame but make no mistake - this is the #BidenBorderCrisis. The facts back it up: illegal border crossings are up 173% from 1 year ago and 28% since January when President Biden stopped the wall & deportations and started catch & release, he said. While Hudsons stats arent exactly right, he has a point about illegal border crossing numbers increasing significantly since last year and even since January. As for whats causing the situation at the border, experts say his description is off. Border crossing numbers are available at the U.S. Customs and Border Protections website. When the webpage opens, a chart will appear showing data that combines two types of encounters: those recorded by Border Patrol, and those recorded by the Office of Field Operations. Whats the difference? The field office deals with people who showed up at an official port of entry in an attempt to legally enter and were turned away. Meanwhile, Border Patrol data includes people who attempted to enter the country without going through the legal process. If you combine the two pools of data, the total number of encounters this February is 173% higher than it was last February. This is likely where Hudsons figure comes from. The agency reported a total of 100,441 encounters in February, up from 36,687 last February. However, to focus on illegal border crossings, its more effective to omit field office encounters and focus on Border Patrol data. If we just look at encounters with Border Patrol, they triple from 30,077 last February to 96,974 this February. Thats an increase of 222%. One thing to note is that the agency tracks crossings — not people, meaning some of the documented crossings could be from the same person. In fact, the agency estimated that between last March and this February 38% of all encounters involved recidivism, or individuals who have been apprehended more than once. As for month-to-month numbers, encounters rose roughly 28% with or without field office data. In summary, Hudson is right in that the rise in illegal crossings was likely 173% — at least. He looked at the wrong numbers but the miss doesnt undermine his point. Now lets look at what Hudson claims is the reason for the rise. PolitiFact NC interviewed four experts who each said Hudson inaccurately described Bidens policies and overlooked the myriad of reasons for the situation at the border, which PolitiFact wrote about earlier this month. Does the wall have anything to do with the current problem at the border? Experts say no. The wall was not a factor at all, said David Bier, an immigration expert at the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank. It has no effect on whether people cross the border — only on where they cross. No more walls are being built right now. But it does not matter, said Tony Payan, director of the Center for the United States and Mexico at Rice Universitys Baker Institute for Public Policy. The wall has no practicable effect on crossborder irregular migrant traffic or drug smuggling for that matter, Payan said. Its true that Biden has halted construction of the wall along the southern border. However, its wrong to suggest that further construction would have made a difference. As PolitiFact has previously reported, former President Donald Trump replaced roughly 200 miles of existing border fencing over four years but erected only a few miles of new border wall. It is not as if continued construction of border walls and fences would have hermetically sealed the border tomorrow, said Lynn Marcus, director of Arizona Universitys Community Immigration Law Placement Clinic. New segments of the wall take years to build, said Nicole Hallett, director of the Immigrants Rights Clinic at the University of Chicago Law School. The amount of wall that would have been built between January and now is negligible and would have practically no effect on how many people are crossing the border. Now to the last part of Hudsons tweet. Did Biden stop deportations? And is that part of the reason for the rise in border crossings? This is a gross mischaracterization. When Biden took office, his administration ordered a 100-day pause on the deportation of people with final orders of removal. However, that pause didnt apply to people who posed a threat to national security, who were convicted of a felony, or who were incarcerated at the time of the memo. And a federal judge later blocked Bidens move. Biden also started allowing some asylum-seekers back into the country. That rule-change is expected to affect 25,000 asylum cases, according to a PolitiFact story from mid-February. In the meantime, federal law allows border officials to turn people away because of the public health emergency. This law is referred to as Title 42. Out of the roughly 96,000 migrants encountered by Border Patrol in February, more than 70,000 were turned away because of this rule. Bottom line: Deportations have not stopped. What about a supposed catch and release policy? Trump and other conservatives have used this term derogatorily over the years, sometimes referring to any rule that allows an immigrant to walk free. However, this Obama-era rule specifically allows asylum seekers to remain in the U.S. while awaiting court dates. (PolitiFact went over the rule in a recent fact check of the Texas governor.) The Trump administration tried to ban catch and release in 2018. Biden lifted Trump's edict in early February, with the border patrol agency citing housing limitations as part of the reason why. Per longstanding practice, when long-term holding solutions arent possible, some migrants will be processed for removal, provided a Notice to Appear, and released into the U.S. to await a future immigration hearing, an agency spokesman told Yahoo News. Experts dismissed the idea that catch and release has much to do with the rise in border crossings. Biden hasnt changed catch and release policy in any meaningful way from Jan. 20, said Bier, the Cato expert. More people are being released only because Mexico is refusing to take more than a certain number back. But he is removing far more and releasing far fewer migrants than Trump in the 2019 wave. When we asked Hudson for the source of his information, his office cited four news articles about immigrants who said they expected Bidens administration to grant them entry. Spokesman Greg Steele said Bidens administration is clearly contributing to migrants surging to the border. Experts told PolitiFact theyre not surprised some migrants cite Biden as a reason for their reason for crossing the border, either because theyre overly optimistic or because theyre misinformed. No doubt, human smugglers take advantage of people's desperation by promising that, with the change in administrations, the U.S. will now welcome them with open arms, Marcus said. While such messages may give hope to some who incur substantial debt to undertake the dangerous journey to the U.S. border, they are not the main reason people leave, nor are they based on fact. The four experts who emailed with PolitiFact NC about the situation said there are multiple reasons for the rise in border crossings. The number of migrants are on the rise, said Payan, the Rice University expert. But, interestingly, they are showing the same pattern — they rise in the spring and summer and fall in the fall and winter. They have cited warming weather, political instability in immigrants home countries, hurricanes that hit Central America last year, and the economic fallout from the coronavirus pandemic. They also said Trumps attempts to reject people seeking asylum, attempts that were challenged in the courts, created a logjam. The U.S. Customs and Border Protection agency mentioned some of these causes in a Feb. 10 press release. A Washington Post analysis found that the rise in migrants at the border follows a seasonal pattern set in fiscal year 2019, with the addition of pent-up demand from people who stayed home in 2020 because of the pandemic. Hallett, the expert at the University of Chicago, pointed out that border crossings still havent reached the level they were in spring 2019, when there were 100,000 crossings per month for four months straight. That would suggest that something independent of U.S. policy is at least partly responsible for the increase, she said. Hudson said Illegal border crossings are up 173% from 1 year ago and 28% since January when President Biden stopped the wall & deportations and started catch & release. Hudsons numbers are slightly off, but his point about illegal crossings rising nearly 200% is accurate. However, experts say the reasons for the rise in border crossings are complex and not fairly summarized by pinning the blame on border wall construction and Bidens deportation policies.

Final Rating: Half True  ","U.S. Sen. Johnny Isakson has never proposed, nor voted in favor of, a substantial cut in federal spending and has voted for many substantial increases in federal spending.","Note to readers: a letter to the editor responding to this item appeared Oct. 11, 2010. The letter appears at the end of the article. Chuck Donovan gave us a challenge.The Libertarian nominee for Georgia's U.S. Senate seat asked AJC PolitiFact Georgia to check out some claims on his campaign website about the incumbent, Sen. Johnny Isakson, R-Ga. Voters will decide among Isakson, Donovan and Democrat Michael Thurmond on Nov. 2.We looked at Donovan's blog, which included a post called Isakson's Inconsistencies. The post challenged the Republican on a host of issues, but one line questioning Isakson's conservative credentials on federal spending stood out.Mr. Isakson has never proposed, nor voted in favor of, a substantial cut in federal spending, Donovan began. However, he has voted in favor of: (a) many substantial increases in federal spending; and (b) tremendous annual deficits.Challenge accepted.Isakson spokeswoman Sheridan Watson showed us a page on the senator's website full of news releases and statements highlighting votes and bills he supported to curb spending. It also noted Isakson has twice won the Taxpayers' Friend Award from the National Taxpayers Union for his efforts to curb federal spending.Happy investigating, Watson wrote us.Donovan's post was researched and written by fellow Libertarian Allen Buckley, an Atlanta-based attorney and certified public accountant who won 2 percent of the vote in an unsuccessful campaign against Isakson in 2004.Let's look at the first part of Donovan's claim: Isakson has never proposed or voted for a substantial cut in federal spending.The senator's website offers four main arguments to dispute Donovan. Isakson has voted often to cap discretionary spending, programs that are not entitlements such as Medicare and Social Security. Discretionary spending, which includes the Defense Department budget, has amounted to about as much as 40 percent of the total federal budget in recent years. Second, the senator has been a big proponent of biennial budgeting, preparing and adopting budgets for two-year periods. The federal budget is currently adopted on an annual basis. Biennial budgeting proponents argue the idea would allow the federal government to adopt two budgets in one year and spend the second year taking more time to improve how government works. Others, including the Congressional Budget Office, have warned biennial budgeting could backfire if the revenue streams are uncertain, which makes it difficult to budget accurately.Third, Isakson supports the Pay It Back Act, which would require that money repaid by banks and other businesses who received taxpayer dollars from the Troubled Assets Relief Program (TARP) be used toward deficit reduction.The fourth idea is legislation introduced in 2006 and 2007 by U.S. Sen. Judd Gregg, R-N.H., called Stop Over-Spending. Isakson co-sponsored the bill. SOS aimed to reduce the federal deficit and essentially balance the budget by 2012 through slowing the rate of growth for entitlement programs, except for Social Security, if Congress doesn't meet deficit reduction targets. It also gave the president a line-item veto. The Senate never voted on the bill.The SOS bill received positive reviews from the conservative organizations National Review and the Heritage Foundation, saying it would have forced Congress into disciplined spending. University of Virginia political science professor James Savage was one of the few academics who studied the bill when it was introduced and he had problems with it. Savage and others contend that deficit reduction is not sound economic policy during a recession because more federal investment is needed to revive the economy, either through cutting taxes, lowering interest rates or spurring consumer spending through a stimulus. Now, let's look at whether Isakson has voted in favor of many substantial spending increases.Donovan's camp says Isakson went along with Republicans on a series of spending increases when the GOP controlled Congress. Much of Donovan's argument on this point deals with bills from 2001 to 2004, when Isakson was in the U.S. House. During that time, Isakson voted for several bills during a time when the gross federal debt grew from about $5.8 trillion at the end of fiscal year 2001 to nearly $7.4 trillion by the end of fiscal year 2004. The debt was projected to rise to $13.8 trillion for the fiscal year that ended Sept. 30. Isakson voted in 2002 to spend $350 billion over 10 years for a prescription drug benefit for Medicare. Additionally, he voted for bills that increased defense spending by about 10 percent a year and legislation that raised the discretionary spending cap from $661 billion in 2001 to $819 billion in 2004. The senator has been more of a fiscal hawk since Democrats became the majority party in Congress in 2007, Donovan said.The senator voted in 2006 with 51 of his 54 fellow Republicans to increase the national debt limit by $787 billion, raising the debt ceiling to $9 trillion. Some senators defended the decision, saying additional funds were needed for health and education programs. Isakson also voted in 2008 for the $700 billion TARP but has since criticized expansion of that legislation.So where does this leave us on Donovan's statement about Isakson? The October 1, 2010 truth-o-meter says an allegation made on the website of Chuck Donovan, Libertarian Party U.S. Senate candidate, is half true. The article notes that I researched and wrote the provision—which is correct. The provision reads: Mr. Isakson never proposed, nor voted in favor of, a substantial cut in federal spending; however, he has voted in favor of: (a) many substantial increases in federal spending; and (b) tremendous annual deficits. The article did not consider the four facets of the statement, but instead focused on spending. The allegedly untrue part is the part about Mr. Isaksons proposals relating to, and votes for, substantially cutting spending. Cited in favor of Mr. Isakson are proposed caps on discretionary spending, Mr. Isaksons support for biennial budgeting and Mr. Isaksons support of the Pay It Back Act, which reportedly requires money paid back by banks and other businesses who received taxpayer dollars from the TARP be used towards deficit reduction. These things are not bad things, but they do not reduce spending at all. Concerning caps on future discretionary spending, it appears the reporter or the truth-o-meter judges, or both, failed to distinguish a cut in spending from a limit on future spending increases. Also cited is the Stop Over Spending (SOS) bill, which I was told by the reporter with whom I met was the only thing the Isakson campaign cited in its defense. As I explained to the reporter, nothing in the SOS bill requires that any spending be substantially cut at all. I thoroughly provided reasoning therefore. I gave the reporter examples of things that would result in a substantial cut in spending, such as repeal of Medicare Part D. According to the Medicare Trustees, Medicare Part D had a present value liability figure in 2008 that exceeded 31 percent the net worth of all Americans combined as of the end of 2009. I encourage all readers to read the SOS bill (it can be found online). Also cited in favor of the senator is his vote against a spending increase relating to Iraq and Hurricane Katrina recovery efforts because it included $700 million in earmarks. Voting against a spending increase is not proposing, or voting in favor of, a cut (or a substantial cut) in spending. The only thing cited to cut spending was small proposed cut in Medicare and Medicaid that would reportedly have cut 2 percent from budget deficit forecasts over five years. The spending cuts were estimated to be $36 billion. The per-year average spending cut would be $7.2 billion (i.e. $36 billion divided by 5). Total federal spending for 2008 amounted to approximately $2,983 billion. I do not believe something that could cut spending by 0.2 percent (i.e. 7.2 divided by 2,983) could reasonably be considered to substantially cut spending. It is akin to a 2 cent saving on a good that would ordinarily cost $10. After publication, through email correspondence with the reporter, I was told the truth-o-meter judges felt the average person would consider the SOS and pay-go, etc. as significant efforts to cut spending. I replied by first noting that Senator Isakson consistently voted against pay-go when his party was in power. I also offered the following example that an ordinary reasonable person could understand: If an individual said his family spends $1,000 per week but plans to limit future spending increases, but the individual said no other actions would be taken regarding spending, no ordinary reasonable person would think that person had planned to cut his familys spending, let alone cut the spending substantially. Martindale-Hubbell is the organization that rates lawyers, and the rating is done by other lawyers. I have, and for many years have had, an AV rating from Martindale-Hubbell. An AV rating is the highest rating in terms of work quality and integrity (including honesty). Simply put, I tell the truth. In sum, Senator Isakson never proposed, nor voted in favor of, a substantial cut in spending. Thus, I told the truth. The GAO said in 2007: GAOs long-term simulations continue to show ever larger deficits resulting in a federal debt burden that ultimately spirals out of control. While I am very disheartened by the truth-o-meter article, what is really sad is that you have helped Mr. Isakson so he can continue fulfilling GAOs prophesy.

Final Rating: Half True  ","Federal, state and local governments have subsidized the production of the Volt to the tune of estimates between $50,000 and $250,000 per vehicle sold.","Political charges were in the air at a Jan. 25, 2012, congressional hearing on the Chevrolet Volt chaired by Republican Rep. Jim Jordan, a staunch critic of the Obama administrations intervention in the General Motors bankruptcy.Jordan, from Ohios Champaign County, said he called the hearing to explore whether the governments involvement in General Motors swayed how the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration informed consumers about crash tests that caused fires in the hybrid electric vehicles batteries. At the hearing, his committee released a report titled: Government Motors: A Preliminary Report on the Effects of Bailouts and Politics on the Obama Administrations Ability to Protect American Consumers. He opened the hearing with a statement that outlined some of his beefs with the governments role in GM, including tax subsidies to the Volt.Total federal, state and local governments have subsidized the production of the Volt to the tune of estimates between $50,000 and $250,000 per vehicle sold, said Jordan.That number seemed shocking for a car with a low-end retail price of $31,645, so we asked Jordans office where it came from. His spokeswoman said his statement relied on a Dec. 21 study from Michigans Mackinac Center for Public Policy - which estimated that each of the 6,000 Volts sold up until that date has received between $50,000 and $250,000 in subsidies.Its analysis tallied up nearly $3 billion worth of state and federal assistance it said were offered for the Volts development and production.It cited 18 tax credits and government subsidies for General Motors and its suppliers - such as a $105.9 million U.S. Department of Energy grant to the General Motors plant in Brownstown Township southwest of Detroit, a $106 million state job retention credit for its Detroit-Hamtramck plant and up to $100 million in refundable battery credits for a Volt battery supplier called Compact Power.The biggest slice of that money - $1.5 billion - comes from a $7,500 tax credit that the IRS offered to the the first 200,000 buyers of the Volt, or other electric cars from GM. Similar credits are available to buyers of other manufacturers electric vehicles. When author James Hohman compiled his statistics, roughly 6,000 Volts had been sold. By the time Jordan held his hearing, GM said the vehicles sales were around 8,000.GM has estimated theyve sold 6,000 Volts so far, said Mackinacs report on Hohmans work. That would mean each of the 6,000 Volts sold would be subsidized between $50,000 and $250,000, depending on how many government subsidy milestones are reached.The report said it didnt include subsidies that could boost the level of government aid, such as the land for one of the GM assembly plants being acquired through eminent domain by General Motors. Hohman said the Volt might be the most government-supported car since the Trabant, a car that was made by the formerly communist state of East Germany.Mackinacs data was attacked immediately. An analysis in The Street on Dec. 22, 2011, criticized its methodology of dividing $1.5 billion in subsidies by the 6,000 cars sold to reach his $250,000 per vehicle number. The Street, a digital financial media company established in 1996, said the author would have reached a very different statistic if the study had been done at the end of 2012 - when GM projects it will have made 60,000 of the cars. It said that technology from the car will be used in roughly 60 million vehicles over the next in 25 years, which would make for a subsidy of roughly $25 per car.The absurdity of the math used can be further shown by asking what the study would have yielded if it had been done six months ago or a year ago, said The Street. Six months ago, 3,000 Volts had been sold and therefore the implied subsidy was $500,000 per car - half as many cars, twice the subsidy per car. One year ago, the first Volt was sold and therefore this one car must have cost $1.5 billion, according to the reasoning by the people who wrote the headlines around this study.General Motors spokesman Greg Martin said Mackinacs study is not even in the same area code as accurate. He said the study compiled every conceivable energy battery subsidy over the past several years, whether or not it had anything to do with the Volt, added it up and came up with this outrageous $250,000 subsidy per Volt.For example, five of the tax credits and loans cited in Mackinacs report, totaling more than $388 million - went to a battery maker called A123 that has nothing to do with the Volt, Martin said. He says its fair to question the wisdom of of subsidies and consumer incentives for vehicle purchases, but a serious debate should not be clouded and distracted by fun and games with numbers.In an emailed response to questions about his study, Hohman said its high-end $250,000 estimate includes the A123 money that GM disputes because, at the time the incentives were being awarded, both government policy makers and the company itself were unsure about the suppliers.However, with the Volt in mind as the standard bearer for the idea of a mass produced American-made EV, it was unlikely that a lot of these deals would have been approved--or certainly approved at the levels offered -- without the Volt. Hohmans email said.Although Hohman says a number of Volt-associated projects got local government assistance in addition to federal and state aid, he excluded those incentives from his calculations because they were inconsistently reported. Hohman said he felt that calculating the maximum amount of assistance offered to the Volt added valuable context to discussions about the vehicle. He said the federal and state entities that awarded incentives to the project never got together to try to figure out just how much each car would receive. He said The Street was correct to assert that the per-vehicle subsidy he calculated would decrease as more vehicles are sold, but said thats a clear implication from how we describe the calculations.Ernest Goss, an economist at Nebraskas Creighton University who is critical of tax incentives to large companies, said such incentives often lead to construction of projects that would not be built otherwise and may be mistakes. He said he believes the Chevrolet Volt is very costly to the taxpayer and probably not worth the subsidy, but the scope of government subsidies can be difficult to gauge.The question is, what subsidies do you count? says Goss. There is no doubt there have been significant subsidies going to GM, which is problematic, given that GM was bailed out and taxpayers still own a significant share of GM.So, where does that leave Jordans assertion?Jordans claim is partially accurate. He stated it as fact, relying on the study from the Mackinac Center. That study did estimate the Volt has received between $50,000 and $250,000 in aid per vehicle, although its tally did not include local government aid, as Jordan said. And his underlying point is true -- that there has been much subsidy directed toward development of the Volt.But the claim leaves out important details that are need to fully understand the truth.Mackinacs numbers seem inexact and fluid and designed to make headlines at the expense of accuracy. They include money that went to a company that doesnt supply the Volt.And the per-vehicle tally considers all aid awarded at a time when Volt sales are just beginning. That figure will fall dramatically -- a point the studys author concedes -- as more Volts and cars that use its technology are sold, with one analysis citing a figure of $25 per car if projected out over the next 25 years.On the Truth-O-Meter, Jordans claim rates Half True.",0.5,0.5,1.0,0.5,0.0,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,Half True

Final Rating: Mostly False  ","We have an unemployment (rate of) 1.5 in Boone County, and we cant find enough workers.","Missouri Rep. Cheri Toalson Reisch has been working since 2017 to pass a bill that would prevent the state from prohibiting felons and other convicted criminals from working for businesses that sell alcohol and lottery tickets. During a discussion of the bill on April 1, Reisch brought up the job market in her district, pointing to low unemployment. We have an unemployment [rate of] 1.5 in Boone County, and we cant find enough workers, Reisch said. This [bill] will allow employers to hire felons if they want to. We decided to see if these unemployment figures hold up. When asked where she got her data, Reisch explained that she was referring to a figure that measured the unemployment rate in the Columbia, MO Metropolitan Statistical Area, which consists of Boone County, during October 2017, citing a Columbia Tribune article. Reischs claims do match the preliminary statistics found in a U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics news report released in November 2017, but more recent data shows that the unemployment rate has not stayed the same. The unemployment rate measures the number of unemployed people, which refers to those who were not employed during the time of measurement, were currently available for work and were actively looking for a job, as a percent of the civilian labor force. The Bureau of Labor Statistics indicates that the average monthly unemployment rate in Columbia was 2.6 percent in February 2019. Unemployment rate varies seasonally, meaning that rates in October usually are lower than rates in February. In 2018, the average yearly unemployment rate was 2.4 percent.  Since 2010, unemployment rates in Columbia have been falling. For comparison, the unemployment rate in Columbia was 2.6 percent in February 2018 and 3.2 percent in February 2017. This difference between Reischs 1.5 percent and the 2018 annual estimate of 2.4 percent is the difference between a very tight labor market and a very, very tight labor market, Michigan State University economics professor Steve Woodbury said in an email. Is this difference statistically significant? The Bureau of Labor Statistics does not release confidence intervals for metropolitan statistical area unemployment rates, but we do know that these estimates are subject to sampling and other errors. Compared to other cities and towns in the U.S., Columbia does have a low unemployment rate.  When Reisch has repeated her claim on unemployment in the past, she has included this in her talking points. This [the 1.5 percent figure] is the second-lowest [unemployment rate] in the country, Reisch said on March 28. We cannot find enough employees. We would like to put these felons to work. We need them to avoid recidivism and make a better live for themselves and their families. Reisch said she based this claim on the same Bureau of Labor Statistics Data from October 2017. As of February 2019, Columbia is actually tied for the spot of 10th-lowest unemployment rate. There are several possible explanations for the low unemployment rate in Reischs district. Bernie Andrews, Executive Director of Regional Economic Development Inc., a Columbia and Boone County economic development organization, notes that Columbia has a diverse business economy based on stable industries such as education, health care and insurance. In addition, Columbia and Boone County both have high rates of education. The unemployment rate for people with a college education is lower than that of the average civilian population. According to Census data, 54.3 percent of people 25 or older in Columbia have a bachelors degree or higher. For Boone County, that figure is 45.9 percent. In comparison, the national average is 30.9 percent. Reisch said, We have an unemployment [rate of] 1.5 in Boone County, and we cant find enough workers. Reischs figures do not reflect the most recent data, but her point that her district has one of the lowest unemployment rates in the nation still stands.",0.5,0.5,1.0,0.5,0.0,0.3,0.4,0.4,0.4,Mostly False

Final Rating: Mostly True  ","Says Joe & Jill Bidens income went from $396,456 in 2016, to $16,596,979 in 2017-2019. Anyone else want to know where that money is coming from?","When Joe Biden left office in early 2017 after four years as vice president, his finances reflected the salary he earned as a longtime public servant. He and his wife, Jill, a teacher and professor, reported adjusted gross income of just under $400,000 on their joint tax return form in 2016. In the years that followed, though, their adjusted gross income ballooned: to about $11 million in 2017, plus another $5.6 million over 2018 and 2019. The change intrigued social media users. One Facebook post says, Joe & Jill Bidens income went from $396,456 in 2016, to $16,596,979 in 2017-2019. Anyone else want to know where that money is coming from? The post was flagged as part of Facebooks efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Its among several posts that have tried to raise questions about the sources of the Bidens wealth. The post compares a one-year income figure to a combined three years, inflating the difference somewhat. But the figures themselves are right on the money: The Bidens reported earning $396,456 in 2016 and a total of $16,596,979 from 2017 to 2019 — which includes $11,031,309 in 2017; $4,580,437 in 2018; and $985,233 in 2019. But the big mystery postulated in the claim — Anyone else want to know where that money is coming from? — is not such a big mystery. Many of the answers are detailed in the tax documents the Bidens have made public, which make clear that their big income gain for those years came mostly from fees for speaking engagements and book deals. Most of Joe Bidens paid speeches from late 2017 through mid-2018 were part of a tour promoting his November 2017 book Promise Me, Dad, a New York Times bestseller about the loss of his son Beau to brain cancer. Bidens book-tour events brought income ranging from a low of $8,000 to one VIP experience that commanded nearly $235,000 and included preferential seating and a reception, according to his presidential financial disclosure form. Biden earned a total of $1.8 million from 30 book tour events, based on the disclosure. The book sold more than 300,000 copies, Forbes reported. Promise Me, Dad was part of a deal Biden struck with Flatiron Books to write two non-fiction works as well as a third book with Jill Biden, according to Publishers Weekly, which reported that the three-book deal was worth $8 million. Besides his book tour, Biden participated in events such as the MPSF Speaker Series in California, where he delivered four speeches around the state for a total of about $500,000, according to the financial disclosure. From late 2017 through July 2019, he had 19 speaking engagements that earned him a total of $2.4 million, the disclosure says. The Bidens sources of income from 2017 through summer 2019 also included Jill Bidens speaking engagements, which brought in about $700,000, and Joe Bidens job as a professor at the University of Pennsylvania, which paid an annual salary of $540,484, according to the disclosure. The money the Bidens earned from book deals and speaking engagements was routed through two S corporations they formed, CelticCapri Corp. and Giacoppa Corp. In his 2019 presidential financial disclosure form, Joe Biden lists $425,000 in salary and $2.8 million in a distributive share from CelticCapri. A Facebook post says Joe and Jill Bidens income jumped from $396,456 in 2016 to a combined $16,596,979 in 2017-2019, and asks Anyone else want to know where that money is coming from? The suggestion that the Bidens income sources are unknown is misleading. They are substantially explained on the tax returns and financial disclosures that the Bidens made public. Those documents show that the Bidens increased income from 2017 to 2019 came mostly from speaking engagements and book deals. This claim takes the Bidens reported incomes from 2016-2019 out of context.",1.0,0.5,1.0,0.7,0.2,0.3,0.4,1.0,0.4,Mostly True

Final Rating: Half True  ","Americans will spend more on taxes in 2015 than on food, clothing and housing combined.","On April 14, 2015, Scott Walker asked followers of his personal Twitter account if theyve been taxed enough already. Did you know, Americans will spend more on taxes in 2015 than on food, clothing and housing combined? Walkers campaign team tweeted. (We know Walker didnt personally pen it because its signed TW, for Team Walker). The tweet highlighted a chart showing Americans collectively paid $4.8 trillion in taxes in 2014, more than the total of the three life essentials. Its a claim PolitiFact National checked in 2014 and 2011 after identical statements by the Tax Foundation and Republican National Committee chairman Reince Priebus, respectively. Both those were rated Half True. Lets see what the latest figures show. Digging into the numbers Walkers campaign told us he relied on the Tax Foundations annual tax freedom day report. Among other things, that report examines taxing and spending figures based on U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis data. Both the Tax Foundation and Walker make clear they are using collective taxing and spending figures -- by using a chart, in Walkers case, and words and charts in the Tax Foundations case. One cautionary note: Full data is not yet available for 2015, since we are not even at the midpoint of the year. The Tax Foundation based its claim about 2015 on 2014 figures that it adjusts for economic growth predicted by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, said Kyle Pomerleau, an economist with the group. We checked the BEAs data for 2014, the latest available, and found a significant edge for total taxes paid over the aggregate amount spend on food, housing and clothing. Total spending on groceries, restaurant meals, clothing, footwear, housing and utilities came to $4.2 trillion. Meanwhile, taxes -- local, state and federal -- rang up to $4.9 trillion. For perspective, total personal consumer expenditures, which includes additional things like vehicles, recreation and health care, were $11.9 trillion in 2014. In recent years, the federal figures show, taxes have consistently topped food, shelter and clothing. Another perspective But PolitiFact Nationals earlier work points out there is another way to look at the comparison: by examining what individual Americans pay. Thats a complex task, but one way to do it is to examine what people at different income levels spend and pay in taxes as a share of their total income. Through that lens, many poorer Americans likely pay a higher share of their income on food, shelter and clothing, in part because they pay little in taxes. Conversely, richer Americans may well pay a higher fraction of their income in taxes and a smaller share for those essentials. So by this other method, for many people, Walkers claim does not hold up. The 2014 item concluded that a majority of Americans probably pay more for the three essentials than for taxes. Our rating Walker claimed, based on what happened in 2014, that Americans in 2015 collectively will spend more on taxes than they do on food, housing and clothing combined. The statement is partially accurate -- on target based on past experience by the method Walker uses, but inaccurate by another method that examines the claim in a fuller context. Thats a Half True on our meter.",0.5,0.5,1,0.5,0,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,Half True

Final Rating: False  ",Says the current survival rate for COVID-19 in the U.S. is 98.54%,"An unsourced but seemingly optimistic statistic on the survival rate of the novel coronavirus in the United States is making a splash on Facebook. Current survival rate for COVID19 in the US is 98.54%. Lets share this story. Positive vs. Panic, it reads. The post, which was shared in mid-April, was flagged as part of Facebooks efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The figure isnt too far off from what databases are reporting right now in terms of the known fatality rate from the disease. But the figures from this developing pandemic are preliminary, and its important to note that the best calculations include people who are still sick — patients who have neither died nor recovered. Also, while a 98.5% survival rate might sound promising, it really isnt. Even a 1% mortality rate (99% survival rate) would mean that a disease is 10-times more lethal than the seasonal flu. If everyone in the country contracted COVID-19, that rate would lead to about 3,300,000 American deaths. Lets look at the numbers. Our World in Data, a collaboration between researchers at the University of Oxford and the nonprofit Global Change Data Lab, uses the case fatality rate to calculate the mortality risk of the disease. Case fatality rate is the ratio of confirmed deaths to confirmed cases. Using that rate, the database shows that the current mortality rate in the U.S. is 5.9%, which puts the survival rate at 94.1%. Johns Hopkins University, which uses the same method, currently lists the U.S. rate at 6%. But even these researchers acknowledge that during a pandemic, the rate of case fatalities is a poor measure of the mortality risk of the disease. Thats partly because the actual number of cases is hard to determine without widespread testing. One, it relies on the number of confirmed cases, and many cases are not confirmed; and two, it relies on the total number of deaths, and with COVID-19, some people who are sick and will die soon have not yet died, Our World in Data researchers wrote in an article. These two facts mean that it is extremely difficult to make accurate estimates of the true risk of death. Dr. Michael Mina, an assistant professor of epidemiology at Harvards T.H. Chan School of Public Health, said that the ability to calculate accurate recovery rates hinges on having access to credible data. The survival rate depends on how well we understand the denominator, Mina wrote in an email. We need to be looking at denominators from good serological surveillance to know the true numbers infected. Additionally, we should consider the infection fatality rate in the context of demographics like age. Infection fatality rate is the number of total deaths from a disease divided by the total number of cases — as opposed to the confirmed deaths and cases. Mina also explained that the data varies sharply when looking at a weighted average of fatality rates for specific age groups: So, a one-number-fits-all value for the infection fatality rate doesnt really make too much sense given the major skew in the data. Even the 94% rate is a flawed statistic amid an ongoing pandemic. Data is incomplete and government agencies and organizations vary in how they collect and report it. Rates that include total cases or confirmed cases should also be considered preliminary, because many outcomes arent known yet: These patients may recover, or they might not. We did find one coronavirus tracking database that singles out the number of deaths among resolved U.S. cases that have had outcomes. Worldometer, a private statistical resource that collects data from official reports, shows that about 289,100 COVID-19 cases in the United States are considered closed as of May 7, 2020. Of those, around 213,500 people have recovered, and about 75,500 have died, according to the database. This represents a 74% survival rate. But this, too, may be off and will continue to fluctuate daily. A Facebook post says the current survival rate for COVID-19 in the US is 98.54%. This is problematic for several reasons. In an ongoing pandemic with incomplete numbers, mortality rates should be viewed with caution. There are a slew of factors to take into account such as variations among demographic groups that skew data, a lack of testing, and the number of active cases. Even discounting these factors, based on current projections, the 98.54% figure is incorrect. If you include all the confirmed cases, the number is about 94%. And while both numbers may sound high, they indicate a fatality rate that is more than 10 times that of the seasonal flu. Ultimately, declaring an accurate U.S. survival rate will be difficult until most cases are resolved and more complete and accurate data is released.",0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,False

Final Rating: Half True  ",Fifty-seven of Rubio's 100 ideas ultimately became law.,"Marco Rubio's two years as speaker of Florida's House of Representatives were marked by passionate speeches, promises of conservative principles and a book filled with 100 ways to transform state government.100 Innovative Ideas For Florida's Future promised a sea change -- from lowering property taxes and insurance rates, to luring Hollywood productions to the state; from recalibrating Florida's schools, to building a better Web site for the state budget.The ideas became the agenda of the Republican-led House in 2007 and 2008 and a personal report card for Rubio, now a candidate for the U.S. Senate.In the end, Rubio gave himself A's.All 100 ideas were passed by the Florida House, Rubio's campaign Web site says. Fifty-seven of these ideas ultimately became law, including measures to crack down on gangs and sexual predators, promote energy efficient buildings, appliances and vehicles, and help small businesses obtain affordable health coverage.The St. Petersburg Times and Miami Herald are launching PolitiFact Florida, accessed online at http://www.politifact.com/florida, with this examination of Rubio's claim. Fifty-seven fact-checks packed into one ruling.At a recent campaign event in front of a room full of reporters, Rubio -- who has met our Truth-O-Meter before -- offered this introduction:I don't want to get PolitiFact-checked today, Rubio said.Sorry. The Truth-O-Meter has come to Florida.How we got startedTaking Rubio at his word on the 43 unsuccessful ideas, we began by asking Rubio's Senate campaign for evidence about the 57 he says became law. Spokesman Alex Burgos pointed us to a May 2008 Miami Herald article, which referenced a two-page report prepared by Rubio's then-legislative staff.That report, like Rubio claims, says 57 of the 100 ideas have been completed.From there, we researched the validity of each claim, matching the idea from the book to a corresponding state law. Some of the ideas in Rubio's report listed specific House or Senate bills that we examined. For others, we searched the Legislature's online repository of bills from the 2007 and 2008 sessions, as well as newspaper articles and press releases from the time.When we found an idea that matched a description in law, we crossed it off our list. When we couldn't, we consulted with the appropriate state agency, the House Majority Office and/or Rubio's U.S. Senate campaign.In the end we created the chart that accompanies this story and shows our findings (at the bottom of this page). Overall, 24 of the 57 ideas Rubio takes credit for delivering we don't question. And we found 10 other ideas that are partially law, or were law under Rubio's watch, but are no longer in effect, or have some other type of asterisk.What Rubio got doneWhen the House and Senate passed property insurance legislation during a special session in January 2007, just two months after Rubio became speaker, House Republicans celebrated with a press release titled Nine down: 100 ideas gets special start.We agree with Rubio on eight of these nine ideas being accomplished. The legislation created a uniform, statewide building code, allowed policyholders to increase or decrease hurricane deductibles depending on the circumstances, and created a Truth in Premium Billing statement for policyholders. But an idea for expanding a short-term, no-interest bridge loan program didn't happen.Rubio can claim many other successes, though.Florida's presidential primary came earlier in 2008 as Rubio promised. Floridians seeking health care coverage now have an online database to check. Drivers can purchase multiple-year vehicle registrations. And the state created an investment money pool for businesses and infrastructure projects.I think that Marco Rubio drove the agenda down to the last hour that he was speaker, said state Sen. Don Gaetz, who worked with Rubio on education reforms in 2008, including four ideas that are now totally or partially law. Literally, in the last two hours he was speaker, I was still negotiating issues with him on behalf of the Senate.One of Rubio's ideas led to a requirement that school districts create career academies -- where students can be training in high-demand/high-need vocations. Another pushed the FCAT to later in the school year. A third increased tax credits for companies that contribute to education scholarships.Rubio supporter and former state Rep. Dennis Baxley, R-Ocala, notes that the ideas aren't all Rubio's -- he collected them at meetings across the state called Idearaisers. The meetings and then the book gave Floridians an opportunity to have their voices heard, Baxley said.The book framed a practical set of issues that the people had brought to us, said Baxley, who served as speaker pro tempore under Rubio. It gave us a platform to work from that was meaningful.Gaetz said Rubio's ideas still come up today.Marco's genius was in actually listening to people around the state and compiling the list of ideas, said Gaetz, who has endorsed Rubio's opponent Gov. Charlie Crist for Senate. He branded those ideas and that's the sign of a smart politician. Even still in 2010, as we put together health care and education bills, there will often be somebody, wryly or respectful, noting that what we're doing is in the 100 ideas book.What's not on the booksQuick math -- if 24 ideas are law, and 10 others are kind of law, that leaves 23 ideas that are something else.In the case of five of the ideas, we find it's wrong to suggest they could be achieved in law. Rubio, for instance, wanted the state to commit to having a Top 10 public university and to building a model transportation system. These, and three others, are more appropriately called broad goals, but none are law. (Rubio's office, in response, points to increased university funding or the leasing of toll roads to private companies as evidence these ideas were fulfilled.)That leaves 18 ideas that have not been enacted.Here's an example:Rubio says seven ideas dealing with the environment are now law thanks to a comprehensive energy bill that passed in 2008.One of our favorites was to provide incentives for alternative-fueled cars, including discounted parking and free or reduced tolls. We have a hybrid in the PolitiFact fleet, and the thought of free or reduced tolls sounded like a great idea.But the bill has no parking or toll incentives for hybrid or other alternative-fuel cars. It does, however, offer lonely hybrid drivers the opportunity to use state High Occupancy Vehicle lanes. But: Two other ideas concern Internet access for sexual offenders and minors, but neither is a law the way Rubio intended. One was to deny sex offenders access to popular Internet networking sites and to install tracking equipment on their computers.What passed in 2007 was a requirement that sex offenders register their e-mail and online instant message names with the Florida Department of Law Enforcement. The state could then forward that information to social networking sites, which could then choose to ban or block those users. During a presentation of the bill, the Web site MySpace.com agreed to receive the information from FDLE. But there is no tracking equipment, nor is there a requirement that MySpace.com or a Web site like Facebook delete the users FDLE finds.The other idea would have required social networking sites to set up verification systems to require parental notification and consent for minors to use these sites. There are no such requirements on sites like Facebook or MySpace.com.In those cases, and others we found, Rubio's ideas got lost as part of compromises between the Senate and House, said Rubio's former House spokeswoman Jill Chamberlin. Rubio supporter Baxley agreed.I don't think that there was an expectation that every bill that would pass would reflect every idea in the book, said Chamberlin, who continues to work for House Republicans. The legislative process is about negotiation and compromise.Rubio campaign spokesman Alex Burgos noted that Rubio himself described the 100 ideas book as much a process as it is a product.The beauty of the 100 ideas project is that these were ideas presented by Floridians, Burgos said. They weren't put in the book as pieces of legislation or executive orders. They were put in there as a starting point to be inserted in the legislative process.Others are less forgiving.At the end of the day, sadly, everyone wants to take credit for it, especially if it's a good idea, said state Sen. Mike Fasano, who is supporting Crist. I think then-speaker Rubio, now candidate Rubio, exaggerates when he suggests he accomplished all of these things.Our rulingRubio's claim is that 57 of the ideas in his book 100 Innovative Ideas For Florida's Future are now law. Based on our analysis, he has fallen short.Using the most generous accounting, Rubio might be able to say that he got 34 ideas into state lawbooks (adding together those ideas that we marked law or kind of law).Rubio's campaign had almost two weeks to review our findings, and responded Feb. 26, 2010, with five pages of explanations. In two cases, their information changed our decisions. We also offered Rubio the chance to address our findings. He chose, through a spokesman, not to.That leaves us to make a Truth-O-Meter ruling based on the information you see here, and in the corresponding chart.Based on our findings, 24 of Rubio's 100 ideas became law. Another 10 were partially enacted. That's not the kind of claim you're likely to hear in a TV ad, but it's what we found.Rubio delivered on education and property insurance reforms, and his book and its ideas remain part of the lexicon of the Florida Legislature. But 23 of the ideas either aren't law or could not be law. We find his claim Half True. Kind of. Committee structure changed, but not by law. Broad goal; cannot be achieved in law. Kind of. Funding increased, but no recurring revenue source. Program now defunct. No. Legislature capped an affordable housing trust fund that lowered overall project funding. One specific program saw increased funding from 2006 to 2007. But it wasnt funded in 2008. Kind of. State created a Web site with links to incentives and rewards, but did not create any new incentives.",0.5,0.5,1,0.5,0,0.5,0.5,1,0.5,Half True

Final Rating: Half True  ",The majority of Georgians incarcerated in local jails have never been convicted of crime. They are simply too poor to pay their bail.,"Stacey Abrams says Georgia must change its criminal justice system so that people arenot kept in jail just because they can't pay for bail. People with money can artfully navigate the criminal justice system and maybe even avoid it altogether, but those who are poor are often overwhelmed by the system, said Abrams, a former Georgia House minority leader whos running to become the states next governor. The majority of Georgians incarcerated in local jails have never been convicted of crime. They are simply too poor to pay their bail, Abrams said on her campaign website. Is that true? Recent state data indicates that about 64 percent of people in Georgia jails are awaiting trial. Its unclear how many of them could not pay for bail, but experts said this is the case for many people nationwide and in other states. As of December 2017, there were 37,340 inmates in jail in Georgia, according to county jail inmate population report published by the Georgia Department of Community Affairs. And 64 percent of them were awaiting trial, the document said.(A more recent population report with inmate data as of Jan. 4 shows a slightly lower inmate count, but the share awaiting trial remains 64 percent.) That tracks with a February 2018 report from the Georgia Council on Criminal Justice Reform. It said also that as of early 2018, 64 percent of all jail inmates were awaiting trial. Abrams campaign also pointed to 2015 data published by Vera Institute of Justice, a nonprofit group trying to end mass incarceration. Its data showed that more than 50 percent of people in Georgia jails in 2015 were in pretrial. Still, those statistics dont necessarily back up Abrams' point because of her word choice. Claiming that the majority of Georgians incarcerated in local jails have never been convicted of crime, is a broad claim that could be false depending on the interpretation of the word never, said William Sabol, a professor in criminal justice and criminology in the Andrew Young School of Policy Studies at Georgia State University. For instance, if by never she meant ever in ones life, then that is likely to be an over-interpretation of the data in the report, Sabol said, because some individuals may have had prior convictions. The Georgia state report did not indicate how many people were jailed because they could not pay for bail. For this part of the claim, Abrams team referenced a national study. Several experts told us they did not have Georgia-specific data on individuals who could not afford bail, but did not dispute the likelihood of Georgia mirroring trends nationwide and from other states. Data on other states indicate that a majority of individuals in jails (as opposed to prisons) are present due to failure to make bail, and so are awaiting criminal trial prior to sentencing, said Arpit Gupta, an assistant professor of finance at NYU's Stern School of Business who has researched the bail system and its impact on low-income defendants. I dont know about Georgia specifically, but it doesnt surprise me that such a large percentage of incarcerated people — especially in local jails — are there awaiting trial because they cant afford bail, said Nancy La Vigne, vice president for the Justice Policy Center at Urban Institute. Some states are eliminating the cash bail system, which is reducing their daily jail populations significantly, she said. A 2016 national report from Prison Policy Initiative said that most people who cant meet bail fall within the poorest third of society. Examining the median pre-incarceration incomes of people in jail makes it clear that the system of money bail is set up so that it fails: the ability to pay a bail bond is impossible for too many of the people expected to pay it, the report said. In fact, the typical black man, black woman and Hispanic woman detained for failure to pay a bail bond were living below the poverty line before incarceration. Using Bureau of Justice Statistics data and in 2015 dollars, the report said, people in jail had a median annual income of $15,109 prior to their incarceration, or less than half (48 percent) of the median for people of similar ages who were not in jail. Still, financial constraints arent the only reasons why some individuals remain in jail before conviction, said Sabol, the Georgia State University professor. Some offenders are detained without bail or with bail set at very, very high amounts because they are perceived to be a danger to the community (preventive detention) or the seriousness of the crime was such that bail was denied, Sabol said. That is a different issue from an inability to pay bail. In Georgia, bail may be denied under certain circumstances to individuals charged with felony offenses, but judges are legally prohibited from denying pretrial bail to individuals charged with a misdemeanor, said the report from the Georgia Council on Criminal Justice Reform. Consequently, the crucial question for misdemeanants in Georgia is not whether they will get bail, but the amount at which it will be set, the report said. The council spotlighted a case involving the city of Calhoun and Maurice Walker. In 2015, Walker was arrested in Calhoun for public intoxication and spent six days in jail because he could not afford to pay the $160 fixed bail amount. Walker sued the city, alleging its bail practice violated due process and equal protection clauses under the Fourteenth Amendment. In 2016, a court issued a preliminary injunction ordering Calhoun to implement post-arrest procedures complying with the Constitution, and told the city it could not keep individuals accused of misdemeanors in custody only because they could not afford a monetary bond, the report said. The case is under appeal. Abrams said, The majority of Georgians incarcerated in local jails have never been convicted of crime. They are simply too poor to pay their bail. State data shows that the majority of people in county jails are awaiting trial. A criminal justice professor cautioned that claiming they have never been convicted of crime could be an overstatement, since some individuals may have had prior convictions. The state report did not indicate how many people were jailed because they could not afford bail. Yet experts told us that based on national trends, its possible that many Georgians in jail are there because they cannot pay for bail for current charges.",0.5,0.5,1.0,0.6,0.4,0.3,0.4,0.8,0.5,Half True

Final Rating: Mostly True  ",I've issued a six-month moratorium on deepwater drilling.,"In his June 15, 2010, Oval Office address on the Gulf oil spill, President Barack Obama defended his decision to temporarily halt new oil drilling in the Gulf of Mexico in the wake of the Deepwater Horizon tragedy. Already, Ive issued a six-month moratorium on deepwater drilling, Obama said. I know this creates difficulty for the people who work on these rigs, but for the sake of their safety, and for the sake of the entire region, we need to know the facts before we allow deepwater drilling to continue. On May 27, Obama did announce a 6-month moratorium on exploratory drilling in the Gulf of Mexico. But if you think that means there's no more oil production going on in the Gulf, you'd be mistaken. Wells that are currently producing oil will continue to produce. There are 72 active platforms in water depths of 500 feet or greater (the definition of deepwater) in the Gulf of Mexico that will be allowed to continue to operate. At issue here is the term oil drilling. Many people use the term broadly to refer to the entire process of extracting oil from the ground, not just drilling the holes looking for oil. But once a well starts producing oil, it's not being drilled anymore. According to the moratorium notice, the U.S. Minerals Management Service will not consider drilling permits for deepwater wells for six months. In addition, operators that are currently drilling any well must proceed at the next safe opportunity to secure the well and take all necessary steps to cease operations and temporarily abandon or close the well until they receive further guidance from the Regional Supervisor for Field Operations. There are 33 drilling operations in water deeper than 500 feet that fit that bill, which means that they needed to get to a safe place and then stop drilling. For the record, Deepwater Horizon was among the wells in the exploratory drilling phase. When the Department of the Interior issued the moratorium directive on May 30, Secretary Ken Salazar published a statement saying, Deepwater production from the Gulf of Mexico will continue subject to close oversight and safety requirements, but deepwater drilling operations must safely come to a halt. With the BP oil spill still growing in the Gulf, and investigations and reviews still underway, a six-month pause in drilling is needed, appropriate, and prudent. We think a lot of people probably assumed Obama's statement meant that all oil operations in the Gulf of Mexico were put on a six-month hiatus. That's not the case. The moratorium relates to exploratory oil drilling, not to existing, oil-producing deepwater platforms, which will continue to produce. So Obama's words were technically accurate, though due to the common use of the phrase oil drilling to refer to all oil operations, we think it may have confused some people. And so we rule his statement Half True.",1.0,0.2,1.0,0.8,0.0,0.1,0.5,1.0,0.6,Mostly True

Final Rating: Half True  ","Says state budget deal between Texas House and Senate leaders funds nursing homes, our public schools and universities and provides financial aid for college students.","Joe Straus, the Texas House speaker, recently joined Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst in announcing a compromise between House and Senate negotiators on the 2012-13 state budget.Straus elaborated in a May 20 press release: The agreement that we reached with the Senate today funds nursing homes, our public schools and universities, and provides financial aid for college students while keeping substantial revenue in reserves and avoiding any new taxes.Check on keeping money in reserve and not raising taxes. But is it fiscally defensible to crow about funding education and nursing homes in this tight budget cycle?To our inquiry, Straus spokeswoman Tracy Young pointed out that specific numbers wouldnt be available until the inked deal was published as the proposed budget. In the meantime, we turned to news reports on the budget deal, which was reached months after the state comptrollers revenue forecast for 2012-13 left lawmakers grappling with a projected shortfall of more than $20 billion to maintain existing spending or services.First, lets look at the public schools.The Austin American-Statesman noted May 24 that the agreement gives public school districts $4 billion less in 2012-13 than they would get under current law. Lynn Moak, a lobbyist whose clients include an alliance of large school districts, told us it allocates about $37 billion to districts -- less money for schools than schools were counting on under the normal school formula process. But Moak said districts will be a lot better off than they would have been under the first House-approved budget, which would have given the schools at least $7.8 billion less than they stood to draw under existing formulas.And state support for higher education? Overall, the agreement cuts that funding about 10 percent in 2012-13, the Dallas Morning News reported May 23. Specifics include: a 25 percent reduction in a fund to help universities reach elite status as research institutions; a 5 percent cut in general academic funding formulas and a 10 percent cut in funding for the states nine health science centers, the newspaper said.Also, the number of Texas college students getting state-backed scholarships will drop by 41,000 from the 153,738 students now getting that aid, the News reported. Thats a 25 percent hit. That includes 29,000 fewer poor and lower-midde-income students who will receive TEXAS Grants, intended for poor and lower-middle-income children.Then again, the budget deal protects formula funding and scholarships at community colleges, state Rep. Dan Branch, R-Dallas told the Morning News.We ran the higher education numbers by the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board, whose spokesman, Dominic Chavez, said state aid to higher ed is actually slated to drop about 8 percent in 2012-13. He said all state-backed college financial aid will decrease 23 percent, with 43,258 fewer students benefiting.To gauge funding for nursing homes, we contacted the Texas Association of Homes and Services for the Aging, which advocates at the Capitol for about 100 nonprofit nursing homes. Spokesman David Thomason said the budget agreement maintains an already-imposed 3 percent reduction in the rate paid for serving nursing-home residents on Medicaid -- more than erasing the 2.7 percent rate increase approved by the 2009 Legislature.Thomason said the association doesnt expect homes to close due to the lowered Medicaid rate, but he predicted staffing reductions and fewer nursing-home slots available to Texans on Medicaid.Summing up, public schools stand to field $4 billion less in 2012-13 than they would have gotten under current law. Higher education, except for community colleges, is likewise due to sustain funding cuts plus a drop in state-supported scholarships. Nursing homes are left with lower rates than they had after the 2009 legislative session.Straus is correct the agreed-upon budget funds these items, but his statement fails to acknowledge the funding is mostly at lower levels than before.

Final Rating: Half True  ",A miscarriage is considered an abortion.,"State Sen. Eddie Lucio Jr., among supporters of a proposal requiring women seeking an abortion to first get a sonogram, made a dramatic statement in the floor debate before senators advanced the measure to the House. There are literally millions of abortions going on each year in our own state, the Brownsville Democrat said Feb. 17, adding that he would like to see the definition of abortion really be looked at. A miscarriage is considered an abortion, and I dont think it should be considered an abortion because thats a natural thing that unfortunately happens. After we sought more information from Lucios office, Lucio spoke again in the debate, saying: A while ago I was speaking with numbers, I misspoke with my numbers. For other articles, weve confirmed that there have been about 50 million abortions nationally since the 1973 U.S. Supreme Court Roe v. Wade ruling and that 80,000 abortions took place Texas in 2008. As we started to check Lucios other floor statement — that a miscarriage is considered an abortion — Lucio told us in an e-mail statement that friends who lost a baby and underwent a procedure to remove the fetus from the womb told him their insurance company considered the procedure an abortion. He said he didnt intend to suggest that a miscarriage in itself should be considered an abortion. I have strong beliefs about life, Lucio said. In an effort to articulate my beliefs... I misspoke. We sought independent guidance on whether a miscarriage is considered an abortion. Carrie Williams, a spokeswoman for the Texas Department of State Health Services, told us miscarriages are sometimes referred to as spontaneous abortions, though she said that the agency doesnt include them in its annual abortion counts. No law requires the agency to track miscarriages, Williams said. Unfortunately miscarriages are very common and often happen before a woman even knows shes pregnant making complete and accurate data collection very difficult, she said. She cited the legal definition of abortion in Texas. According to the Texas Health and Safety Code, an abortion is an act or procedure performed after pregnancy has been medically verified and with the intent to cause the termination of a pregnancy other than for the purpose of either the birth of a live fetus or removing a dead fetus. According to the Guttmacher Institute, which studies and advocates on issues related to reproductive health, 66 percent of 6.4 million pregnancies in 2008 resulted in live births and 19 percent ended in abortions. In Texas, 70 percent of 579,700 pregnancies were live births and 15 percent ended in abortions. An estimated 15 percent of pregnancies result in miscarriages, according to the institute. Rebecca Wind, an institute spokeswoman, told us that while spontaneous abortion is the medical term for an abortion, miscarriages arent included in abortion statistics and there is no national effort to track miscarriages. In many cases, women who have miscarriages may not know they have had them, Wind said, because one can happen early in a pregnancy. Next, we contacted the Texas Medical Association, which represents 45,000 physicians and medical students. Spokeswoman Pam Udall confirmed that doctors usually call a miscarriage a spontaneous abortion because the body itself is aborting the pregnancy, she said. It is a natural consequence that affects up to one in four pregnancies. Udall pointed us to a 2002 pamphlet written by the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, which says the loss of a pregnancy before 20 weeks is called early pregnancy loss. Often the loss is a miscarriage (sometimes called spontaneous abortion by doctors). Where does that leave us? Theres truth in Lucios statement: In medical terms, a miscarriage is also termed a spontaneous abortion. Where the senator got off track was in conflating those natural occurrences with elective abortions — medical procedures that terminate a pregnancy.",0.5,0.5,0.8,0.6,0.1,0.3,0.5,0.8,0.4,Half True

Final Rating: Half True  ",Republican state Sens. Paul Newton and Warren Daniel refused to even give testimony in North Carolinas latest redistricting case.,"Some North Carolina Democrats say gerrymandering efforts were worse in the state Senate than in the state House, in part because two Republican senators didnt testify during a recent redistricting trial. North Carolina legislators redraw the state voting maps every decade after new census data come out. The political party in power typically draws the districts to favor themselves, often prompting lawsuits from critics. That happened again last year. Voting rights groups sued leaders in the Republican-led state House and state Senate, arguing their maps are unconstitutional partisan gerrymanders. A panel of Superior Court judges ruled in favor of the Republicans. So the plaintiffs then appealed to the state Supreme Court. On Jan. 31, ahead of oral arguments before the high court, the North Carolina House Democrats Twitter account tweeted: House Republicans admitted to secret maps and destruction of evidence, but Sens. Paul Newton and Warren Daniel refused to even give testimony. So the question is—what the hell was going on in the [state Senate] that was so much worse than what was happening in the House? Republicans refuted the tweet. Senate Leader Phil Bergers communications team called the Democrats claim evidence-free conspiracy theorizing. Theres a lot to unpack in this tweet, which takes some facts from the redistricting case and frames them in a way that could lead some to think the lawmakers engaged in wrongdoing. First, a portion of the House Democrats claim about secret maps is accurate but some of it is difficult to prove. During the lower-court trial, Republican state Rep. Destin Hall said he and his staffers consulted secret concept maps while leading the chambers restricting process. He said the maps didnt incorporate any racial or partisan gerrymanders. But its unclear whether the maps were intentionally destroyed. The defendants, in court documents, said only that the maps were were not saved, are currently lost and no longer exist. While that may raise questions about records retention, it doesnt prove that the maps were intentionally destroyed. The state Supreme Court overturned the maps on Feb. 4, and ten days later cited the concept maps in its full opinion. One reason the N.C. House Democrats tweet stands out: the secret maps were on the House side—but the tweet makes claims about the Senate. As for Daniel and Newton testifying, its true that they declined to answer questions in a deposition. But its misleading to suggest their silence is indicative of wrongdoing, since they asked the court for—and were granted—protections offered by state laws. The tweet also could give some readers the impression that senate Republicans didnt answer questions at all. Thats not the case. Sen. Ralph Hise, the highest-ranking co-chairman of the state Senates redistricting committee, was deposed and later testified on the third day of the Superior Court trial. Lets review the facts. The N.C. House Democrats Twitter account is run by the Democratic Partys state House caucus. Amanda Eubanks, the caucus executive director, told PolitiFact NC the refused to testify claim is a reference to Daniel and Newton invoking legislative privilege, a state law that can protect legislators from having to provide information about some aspects of the lawmaking process. Before the redistricting trial, plaintiffs sought to depose Daniel, Newton, Berger and House Speaker Tim Moore, also a Republican. Those lawmakers cited legislative privilege and asked to be exempt from the depositions, a motion the court granted on Dec. 24. Once Daniel and Newton were exempted from depositions, they were viewed as ineligible to testify on the stand. So even if they wanted to testify in the trial, its unlikely that they would have been called upon. That said, the scope of legislative privilege is not well defined in state law. So, in a hypothetical case in which a legislator seeks to avoid questioning, a judge could compel a legislator to answer questions about details that arent protected by legislative immunity, lawyers told PolitiFact NC. There are some things in public records like communications between legislators and legislative staff, or when they go to the research group and say, If I propose this, is it legal? Youre not going to get it because its confidential, said Mike Tadych, a partner at law firm Stevens Martin Vaughn & Tadych PLLC, which represents the North Carolina Press Association. But in a trial, you typically cant just assert legislative privilege because youre a legislator and you dont want to talk, said Kym Hunter, a senior attorney for the Southern Environmental Law Center. Legislative privilege could apply potentially to certain parts of what they would be questioned about, but theres certainly many, many aspects which wouldn't be subject to legislative privilege. Voting rights group Common Cause, a plaintiff in the case, included Berger and Daniel on its witness list filing on Dec. 31—after the senators had already been granted legislative privilege. Common Cause didnt call upon either senator during trial, but in court documents the group said it reserves the right to challenge legislative privilege on appeal. The N.C. House Democrats tweet implies that silence by Daniel and Newton is indicative that the Senates behavior was somehow worse than that of Republicans in the House. The accusation is vague and hard to quantify without more information about what action is being measured. When it comes to alleged gerrymandering, none of the three maps drawn by Republican lawmakers stand out as being significantly more partisan than the others. Experts at Princeton University reviewed the state House, state Senate and the congressional maps, giving each an F grade, due to significant Republican advantage. We asked Eubanks what N.C. House Democrats meant by the statement, and she never directly answered the question. Hise, meanwhile, testified that the state Senate and House redistricting processes were very different. Hise noted that he, Daniel and Newton used the same staff assistance provided by Bergers office. He said he wasnt aware of any secret maps being used on the Senate side because all maps were required to be drawn in public view. Hise acknowledged that he never issued a specific directive banning staff from looking at concept maps outside of public view—something state Supreme Court justices noted in their recent opinion—but he said aides were aware of the rules. While the N.C. House Democrats tweet raises questions about the senate process, Berger spokeswoman Lauren Horsch noted that Hises testimony wasnt disputed in court. She added that Hise testified—and the others didnt—in part because the trial was under time constraints. The N.C. House Democrats Twitter account said Newton and Daniel refused to even give testimony in North Carolinas redistricting case. So the question is—what the hell was going on in the [state Senate] that was so much worse than what was happening in the House? Its true that they did not give testimony. But thats because the senators invoked a legal protection called legislative privilege that allowed them to opt out of answering questions in the case. That move alone doesnt necessarily mean they have something to hide. The tweet is partially accurate but leaves out important details, which is our definition of Half True.",0.5,0.5,1,0.5,0,0.5,0.5,1,0.5,Half True

Final Rating: Mostly False  ","All schools in Canada are closed for the rest of the school year, each family will receive $950 every two weeks for the next 15 weeks, banks were notif(ied) to suspend mortgage payments for at least 6 months, and student loans deferred.","Facebook users are sharing a post that credits Canada with responding to the novel coronavirus in ways the United States has not. But the post muddles some details of Canadas response. All schools in Canada are closed for the rest of the school year, each family will receive $950 every two weeks for the next 15 weeks, banks were notif(ied) to suspend mortgage payments for at least six months, and student loans deferred, the March 21 Facebook post says. Imagine if the United States did this, it says. The post was flagged as part of Facebooks efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) In reality, schools in Canadas provinces have not yet been shut down through the years end. The Facebook post also mischaracterized the employment insurance measures that Canada implemented to provide income support for Canadians who miss work due to the coronavirus. Canadas 10 provinces and three territories have mandated school closures with varying dates, which in some cases coincide with the term break, according to UNESCO. As of March 25, heres what each of Canadas provinces has decided for its schools: Alberta: Schools are closed until further notice. British Columbia: Schools are closed indefinitely. Manitoba: Schools are closed until at least April 10. New Brunswick: Schools are closed until at least March 30. Newfoundland and Labrador: Schools are closed indefinitely. Nova Scotia: Schools are closed until at least April 6. Ontario: Schools are closed until at least April 6. Prince Edward Island: Schools are closed until at least April 6. Quebec: Schools are closed until at least May 1. Saskatchewan: Schools are closed indefinitely. In sum, the Facebook post overstated the extent of Canadas school closures, although the situation could change. All 10 provinces have shut down schools for some length of time, but as of March 25, no province had ordered schools closed for the rest of the school year. The Facebook post also mischaracterized Canadas economic response to the coronavirus. On March 18, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced several actions, some of which were replaced in the final legislation, that the government would take to temper the economic burden faced by Canadians.  Canadians should not have to worry about paying their rent or mortgage or buying groceries because of the #COVID19 crisis. Learn how the Government of Canada is taking action to support workers and their families: https://t.co/G3Z1Ean0Mx pic.twitter.com/aukpQcOmXf For starters, the government implemented a six-month, interest-free, moratorium on Canada Student Loan payments for all individuals who are in the process of repaying these loans and secured a six-month payment deferral for mortgages, according to the press release. The government also pledged to introduce an emergency care benefit to provide pay for people who miss work due to the coronavirus and do not have access to paid sick leave. The benefit would have provided up to $900 bi-weekly for up to 15 weeks to Canadian workers who are sick, quarantined, under instructions to self-isolate or taking care of a family member or child who is sick, quarantined, self-isolating or home from school due to closures. Thats not $950 — nor is it worth the same amount in American dollars — and it would not have gone to each family every two weeks, as the Facebook post wrongly claimed. The emergency care benefit would have applied only to workers impacted by COVID-19, while an expansion of child benefits would have delivered more money to families with children. More importantly, the emergency care benefit and another proposed benefit for workers facing unemployment were eventually replaced by the Emergency Response Benefit, which will give $2,000 a month for up to four months for workers who lose their income due to COVID-19. A spokesperson for the Canadian minister of finances office directed us to a press release detailing the new and more generous benefit, which was enacted into law on March 25.  Were doing everything we can to support you right now. Because at a time like this, you should be focused on what matters most - your health and the health of those you love. Thats exactly why were announcing the new Canada Emergency Response Benefit today. ⤵️ The $2,000 per month is roughly the same as $950 every two weeks. But again, it will only apply to workers who lose income due to the coronavirus. It wont apply to each family. A government webpage detailing Canadas efforts to support individuals outlines the emergency response benefit, the six-month moratorium placed on student loans and the flexibility provided to borrowers who need to defer up to six monthly mortgage payments. A Facebook post said: All schools in Canada are closed for the rest of the school year, each family will receive $950 every two weeks for the next 15 weeks, banks were notif(ied) to suspend mortgage payments for at least six months, and student loans deferred. The post is right about mortgage payments and student loans. But it overstates the impact of Canadas new employment insurance benefits and exaggerates the extent of school closures.",0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,Mostly False

Final Rating: Half True  ",Georgia can substantially increase its funding for education by going after $2.5 billion in uncollected taxes.,"Education eats up the largest share of the state budget, so it only makes sense that its consuming much of the debate in the neck-and-neck governors race. Nathan Deal, the Republican incumbent, says his efforts to grow jobs and the economy have paid off for schools. Hs education track record also includes work for passage of a 2012 charter school amendment and a bipartisan deal to shore up the lottery-funded HOPE scholarship and pre-K programs. His challenger, Democratic state Sen. Jason Carter of Atlanta, contends that Deal has shortchanged Georgias children. Hes most critical of $1-billion-a-year-plus austerity cuts to education recommended by Deal in the first three of his four state budgets. Carter, who voted for those three budgets, is promising that, if hes elected, he will increase education spending through a three-pronged approach that involves growing the economy, cutting government waste and going after tax cheats. The latter proposal peaked the interest of our fact-checkers. We reached out to the Carter for evidence to back up the candidates claim. Spokesman Bryan Thomas pointed us to a January report from the state Department of Audits and Account, showing about $4.4 billion in delinquent state taxes. The reports authors estimate that $1.9 billion of the $4.4 billion is uncollected. But Thomas said strong leadership would improve collection of that money. You put the force of the governors office behind it, Thomas told The Augusta Chronicle earlier this month. At a press conference on Aug. 27th, Carter told reporters; Theres $2.5 billion that is uncollected out there from people who are cheating on their taxes, and against whom we arent enforcing the law. The auditors report, points out that about $815 million of the $2.5 billion is at least 15 years old – making it much harder to collect. Of course, that leaves two-thirds of the money apparently there for the taking, right? The left-leaning Georgia Budget & Policy Institute isnt so sure the plan is viable. Executive Director Alan Essig points out that once you account for the people and businesses that lack the means to pay, youre left with people who have intentionally dodged their responsibilities. Even when caught, those scofflaws arent likely to fork over the entire amount owed. Ramping up enforcement will yield more money, but just how much is unclear, he said. Are we talking about $3 million, $30 million, $300 million? Essig said. I dont know what the dollar amount is, and I dont think anyone knows it. Carters proposal to track down delinquent taxpayers is nothing new. Georgia made probably its biggest push to go after tax cheats when Sonny Perdue was governor and Bart Graham was revenue commissioner. We pulled a report that showed Graham identified 420,693 taxpayers that owed a combined $1.6 billion as of September 2003. Some of that debt dated back to 1988. Grahams agency chased down the money on several fronts. For instance, $23 million came in when the state refused to renew alcohol licenses for businesses with outstanding taxes. Another $18.6 million came in when the state began shaming scofflaws by posting their names on the internet. All told, the states two-year vigorous enforcement campaign collected $172.5 million – just 11 percent of what was owed. This is a messier process than (Carter) is suggesting, said Barbara Neuby, a political science professor at Kennesaw State University who specializes in public budgeting and finance. There is no automatic money that comes in once letters go out. Thats because collection would be handled through regulatory enforcement. The same laws that give state agencies broad powers to enforce taxation give people the right to appeal, Neuby said. The hearing process can take months and years, especially if the delinquents hire attorneys to fight enforcement. There is also the matter that some delinquent taxpayers may have legitimate reasons they have not paid – and therefore do not actually owe, Neuby said. State House Appropriations Committee Chairman Terry England, R-Auburn, said there are complications, even if the state could collect the amount in back taxes that Carters claiming. Nobody would argue putting it into education, England said. But thats one -time funds. The question becomes: What about the next year? he said. We circled back out to Thomas about some of the concerns that were expressed. Sen. Carter has never said that this is the only way to pay for the education investments we need, Thomas said. He has identified it as one of several ways to invest in our schools. Other efforts, such as cutting waste and improving efficiency in government, would provide sustained funding for schools, Thomas said. So where does this leave us? Carter said he believes the state can collect a substantial amount to help education by going after delinquent taxpayers. The states experience – and a report from state auditors – say that may be more challenging than he suggests. Carter has a point. But theres theres a lot of context missing from his proposal.",0.5,0.6,0.8,0.5,0.2,0.5,0.5,0.7,0.4,Half True

Final Rating: Half True",Says IBM leader told Obama that using IBM technology to cut fraud could pay for health care reform.,"During a discussion of health care costs at a Nov. 5, 2011, two-person GOP presidential debate outside Houston, Republican presidential candidate Newt Gingrich made a dramatic claim about a White House visit.Gingrich, who was debating then-candidate Herman Cain, said: The CEO of IBM went to the White House and said to (President) Barack Obama, you can pay for virtually all of Obamacare by simply taking existing IBM technology and applying it to stop paying crooks.By Obamacare, a term that some view as polarizing shorthand, Gingrich meant the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, the Democrat-led 2010 overhaul of health care laws. Obama affixed a price tag of $900 billion to the plan when he rolled out his version in September 2009. Subsequent cost estimates varied. So, Gingrich is suggesting a lot of fraud. But was he right that IBM presented the president with such a scheme?By way of background, we note that Gingrich has long advocated using technology to help cut health-care costs. Until recently he led a for-profit consultancy called the Center for Health Transformations, which counted IBM among its clients.We asked Gingrichs campaign for the former House speakers basis in making the statement. Spokesman Joe DeSantis told us: All I can say is that he heard it from someone he trusts. Sorry.But DeSantis directed us to video of a Sept. 14, 2010, Wall Street Journal interview of Sam Palmisano, IBMs then-CEO and chairman.Separately, IBM spokesman Ed Barbini also referred us to the Journal interview. He declined further comment.The video opens with the Journals Alan Murray saying: When President Obama was elected, you started spending a fair amount of time at the White House.Palmisano: Yes, I did.Murray: What was that all about?Well, Palmisano replied, part of it was the administration was reaching out to the business community. I mean, I was one of many, obviously ... around economic (issues)... So we were having lots of input, lots of exchange. Thats what we all were working on at the time.Asked how he thought the White House visits had turned out, Palmisano replied: We havent made any progress. It doesnt mean there hasnt been a lot of interaction.Murray: Well, whats the point of interaction if it doesnt lead to progress?Palmisano: Youd have to ask the people who arent progressing.He added, Weve done tons of work, and for whatever sets of reasons, we havent been able to establish, be in sync with, the priorities.Palmisano offered an example: We -- and Im fairly confident about this one because it required no legislative change -- we could have improved quality and reduced the costs of the health-care system by $900 billion... It was self-funding. You could have insured anybody you wanted to, illegal aliens, dogs, cats, ponies, whatever, right? And the stuff was simple. Did not require any big legislative change.About $400 billion of the reduced costs could be realized through negotiating discounts with drug companies, just as IBM negotiates its own discounts, he said. Buy a nationwide discount, he said. Just like pharmaceutical companies sell to us on a nationwide discount. Its no different. I said, Take the IBM discount! Take the IBM discount. Another example of savings: Two hundred billion in fraud. That was a 3 percent improvement, by the way. This wasnt transformational. ... Theres so much fraud in the system -- 3 percent and then Year 7 was 8 percent, Year 5 was 5 percent. Its 200 billion.Murray: And why didnt they do that? Is there a fraud --Palmisano: I said we would do it for free to prove that it works. They turned us down. Youll have to ask them Free. Free wasnt good enough.Murray asks again: Why?Palmisano replies, I think what it is, not to be judgmental about these things, I really do think what it is is that we weren't aligning with the priorities. ... the priority at the time, if I stay on my example of health care, was not to reduce costs and improve quality. It was to provide insurance and coverage for more people. That was our priority in the line. All we said, if you did this you could fund the priority without increasing the deficit, taking taxes up. And we couldn't sell the case.Lets take a breath here. In the Journal interview, Palmisano insisted he gave the White House an offer to cover the $900 billion estimated cost of the health care plan -- with $200 billion coming from reduced fraud.We were unable to find independent confirmation of such an offer -- and our search of news archives indicates the CEOs comments to the Journal touched off only one follow-up news account. Nearly a month after the interview, on the Oct. 8, 2010, episode of a Fox News program, guest host Stuart Varney said that an IBM spokesman stood by Palmisanos claims.That program aired shortly after a more widely publicized event: On Oct. 6, 2010, Palmisano led a group of high-tech CEOs to the White House to present Obama with a proposal they said could save the government $1 trillion by 2020.Among the plans seven initiatives: saving $500 billion by streamlining supply chains and pushing suppliers to reduce costs; and saving $200 billion by using technology to better detect improper payments -- payments that prove to be unnecessary or fraudulent. The proposal cites an Office of Management and Budget estimate that Medicare accounted for $54 billion of the governments $98 billion in improper payments in 2009.By email, White House spokesman Brandon Lepow did not provide information confirming or denying Palmisanos claims to the Journal about presenting savings ideas. Lepow initially said companies including IBM had offered the administration help fighting fraud. He later told us he had learned his first statement was inaccurate. His follow-up statement said the administration and IBM had worked on possible projects but agreed not to move forward, although IBM is a partner in our work to fight fraud.Our rulingGingrich did not reveal the source of his claim or provide backup beyond the Journal interview. Meantime, the White House did not confirm or deny Palmisanos claims. Contrary to Gingrichs debate claim, though, the then-CEO said $200 billion in funding would come from cutting fraud -- not nearly enough to pay for the health-care overhaul.",0.5,0.5,1,0.5,0,0,0.5,0.5,0.5,Half True

Final Rating: Mostly False  ",Only three in 10 young Americans under 30 -- 30 percent under 30 -- have full-time work.,"Republican Ron Meyer, Jr., 23, recently announced on Fox News that he will challenge incumbent Democrat Gerry Connolly in the 11th District congressional race next year. Meyer had a quick answer for those who wondered whether he is too young to run: Hell turn 25 shortly before the 2014 general election, which is the U.S. Constitutions minimum age for holding a congressional seat. And should he win, Meyer said his youth would give him valuable insight into issues facing young Americans, including a lackluster employment outlook. Only three in 10 young Americans under 30 -- 30 percent under 30 -- have full-time work, Meyer said while announcing his candidacy in a recent interview on Fox News. We wondered whether Meyer was correct. Meyer told us he based his claim on a February 2013 report about civic engagement among 18-29 year olds that was sponsored by the National Conference on Citizenship, Harvard Universitys Institute of Politics and several other groups. One of the findings is that the Millennial Generation -- which the study defined as those born between 1983 and 1994 -- has been hit hard by the sluggish economy. Researchers, computing data from the U.S. Census Bureau and the Bureau of Labor Statistics, looked at 18-29 year-olds and found 62.9 percent are currently working, of which 31.2 percent work on a part-time basis. Meyer interpreted those figures to mean that the remaining 31.7 percent who were employed had a full time job. But his interpretation isnt quite right, according to Kei Kawashima-Ginsberg, a co-author of the report and lead researcher at CIRCLE, the Center for Information and Research on Civic Learning and Engagement at Tufts University. She pointed out the study said that of the 62.9 percent employed, 31.2 percent held part-time jobs -- or slightly less than a third of those in the age group who are working. So when all Americans in that age group are considered -- those employed and those who are not -- about 20 percent have part-time positions and 43 percent have full time jobs, Kawashima-Ginsberg said. Theres another issue to consider. The figures were compiled using November 2011 data. Kawashima-Ginsberg ran new figures for us, using data from the U.S. Census Bureau. For March 2013, she came up with a similar result: 42 percent of people age 18-29 had full-time jobs. Of people 30 and older, 50.4 percent had full-time job in March, according to figures compiled by Kawashima-Ginsberg. Craig Copeland, a senior research associate at the Employee Benefits Research Institute, said economic changes have made it harder for young people to find jobs. But theres another important factor to consider when looking at full-time employment among the 18-29 age group -- many of them are working part time until they leave college. There is a significant percentage of those people who are (working) part-time for a reason, not because they cant find a job, Copeland said. If theyre working part-time, theyre most likely a college student. Over the last decade or so, the number of young people holding a full-time job has trended downwards, even before the Great Recession, Copeland said. The reason is that a higher percentage of that group has been going to college and because members of the Baby Boom generation are staying in jobs longer, Copeland said. But the recession, which ran from December 2007 to June 2009, certainly caused the percentage with full-time jobs to go down faster, he said. Copeland pulled annual average employment figures from the U.S. Census showing that in 2004, 54.1 percent of people age 18-29 had a full-time job and that dropped to 52.6 percent by 2008. By 2011 -- the latest yearly figures available -- the percent of 18-29 year olds with a full-time job was 45.6 percent, he said. Our ruling Meyer said that 30 percent of the Americans younger than 30 had full-time jobs, but he misinterpreted data in a report. The study actually indicates that 43 percent of the age group had full time jobs. While Meyers number is off, his point holds up: a smaller portion of 18-29 year olds hold full time jobs today that before the recession.",0,0.5,1,0.5,0,0,0.5,1,0.5,Mostly False

Final Rating: Mostly False  ",Says Democratic opponentsCal Cunningham and Erica Smith support sanctuary policies.,"Like many Republicans up for election, U.S. Sen. Thom Tillis is putting immigration at the forefront of his campaign. And to contrast himself with his Democratic opponents, hes pointing to state-level policies. In a Jan. 10 email newsletter, the Tillis campaign said Democrats Cal Cunningham and NC Sen. Erica Smith support sanctuary policies. The headline says: Sanctuary policies result in gruesome violence, do Cunningham and Smith still support them? The email goes on to talk about an illegal immigrant who was released from jail in Mecklenburg County despite the objections of the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (also known as ICE). Is it true that Cunningham and Smith support sanctuary policies? Not quite. Cunningham and Smith opposed a bill that would require North Carolina sheriffs to detain people on behalf of ICE. But neither has flat-out endorsed sanctuary policies. Each Democrat has said they believe local governments should have the flexibility to comply or not. About HB 370 Theres no single definition of what constitutes a sanctuary city. The term is loosely applied to cities or states that limit cooperation with federal immigration authorities. In some states, a city can ban its law enforcement from cooperating with ICE (thus earning the term sanctuary city.) But in North Carolina, sanctuary cities are banned. Former Gov. Pat McCrory signed a law prohibiting municipalities from blocking ICE cooperation. However, sheriffs still had (and still have) some wiggle room. Sheriffs can decide independently whether they want to comply with ICE. As PolitiFact NC has reported, ICE detainers arent valid warrants. So a handful of Democratic sheriffs declined to honor detainers. They said they didnt want to use local resources for federal business, and they feared that cooperating with ICE would harm relationships with their Hispanic constituents. That brings us to the Tillis campaigns argument. North Carolina lawmakers last year considered a bill that wouldve required sheriffs to comply with ICE. More specifically, the bill -- labeled House Bill 370 -- wouldve required North Carolina sheriffs to hold inmates for up to 48 hours beyond the terms of their jail sentence if requested to do so by ICE. Contacted by PolitiFact, Tillis spokesman Andrew Romero said the campaigns claim is based on Cunningham and Smith opposing House Bill 370. (PolitiFact has written about HB 370 previously, when President Trump made a Mostly False claim about Democratic congressional candidate Dan McCready.) The GOP-controlled state legislature passed HB 370. But Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper vetoed it, so it never became law. What Cunningham said The Tillis campaign cited an interview Cunningham conducted with WFAE in Charlotte. Reporter Steve Harrison asked Cunningham if he agreed with the Mecklenburg County Sheriffs decision to ignore ICE detainer requests. Cunningham said: I tend to trust law enforcement to discharge its duty, adding that Mecklenburg voters elected the sheriff and have the power to hold him accountable. I trust the voters in Mecklenburg County to weigh in on exactly that, he said. Heres what I know. That law enforcement makes difficult decisions every day. And as a United States senator, its not my job to second guess, its my job to make sure they have the resources they need to keep their communities safe. The Tillis campaign also noted Cunninghams opposition to a federal bill Tillis introduced. The bill that would compel local law enforcement officials to comply with federal detainer requests or face possible civil action by victims and the loss of federal grants. Asked about the bill, Cunningham campaign spokesman Aaron Simpson accused Tillis of threatening funding for North Carolina to score cheap political points, the Charlotte Observer reported. What Smith said As for Smith, she voted against HB 370 when it was before the state Senate. She also talked about the bill during a couple interviews. Speaking with WFAE, Smith cited some of the same arguments as Cunningham. But she also said she would be OK with local law enforcement honoring ICE detainer requests so long as the federal government paid for the costs. I'm fine (with sheriffs) detaining them if the federal government is going to foot the bill and do their jobs. Certainly, we do not want the release of people who are a threat to public safety, she said. But if ICE and Department of Homeland really wants us to close their detention, then they should pay for it. They're getting taxpayer dollars to do just that. Speaking with Tim Boyum on Spectrum News, Smith made the same argument. If you want the sheriffs to enforce and detain illegal immigrants, then send them the appropriations and the funding. That is the US Senates responsibility. Our ruling Tillis said Cunningham and Smith support sanctuary policies. Both candidates oppose a bill that would require sheriffs to comply with ICE. But thats not the same as endorsing sanctuary cities. In fact, Smith said she would support a sheriffs decision to comply with ICE if ICE offered financial assistance. His statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context.",0.5,0.7,0.8,0.4,0.3,0.6,0.5,0.8,0.6,Mostly False

Final Rating: Half True  ","Says Tony Evers wants to cut Wisconsin's prison population in half, a dangerous plan that today would mean releasing thousands of violent criminals back into our communities.","A week before the primary vote, when Republican Gov. Scott Walker didnt know which opponent he would face in the Nov. 6, 2018 general election, he tweeted this claim: A number of Democrats running for governor want to cut the prison population by 50% and that would require the release of thousands of violent felons.  Our rating was Half True. There was no evidence to back up the require part of Walkers claim, particularly if a 50 percent reduction were done over a period of years, rather than swiftly. A new, similar Walker attack — zeroing in on Tony Evers — has a similar problem. All our fact checks in the governors race. On Sept. 12, 2018, a month after Evers, the state schools superintendent, emerged from the primary as the Democratic nominee, Walker elevated his attack to a television ad. The governors spot begins with a narrator portraying Evers as putting the public at risk, saying he failed to remove abusive teachers from our schools. Then the narrator asserts that Evers wants to cut Wisconsin's prison population in half, a dangerous plan that today would mean releasing thousands of violent criminals back into our communities. Walkers use of the word today aims to avoid the problem that the word require caused in his previous fact check. That is, a 50 percent reduction today — rather than say, over a period of years — would require the release of thousands of inmates convicted of violent crimes. There are currently about 23,000 inmates, two-thirds of whom have committed a violent offense, according to the state Department of Corrections. That two-thirds portion includes inmates being held for a violent-crime conviction; and it includesthose who served their time behind bars for that original offense, but were returned to prison for violating conditions of probation orextended supervision that was also part of the sentence for the original offense. Violent offenses include crimes such as murder, rape and robbery, as well as crimes such as assault, extortion and hit-and-run with bodily injury. But Evers has not put a time frame on how he would achieve a 50 percent reduction. And its important to keep in mind that releasing half the inmates who are in prison isnt the only way to cut the prison population in half. Like us on Facebook. Follow us on Twitter: @PolitiFactWisc. On the day Walkers TV ad was released, Evers reacted by telling reporters: Thats a lie. I never said that. We will not release violent criminals. Were not going to get in the gutter with Scott Walker. (Walker has also made a claim similar to the one in his TV ad in a private telephone poll of voters done by his campaign.) To back the first part of Walkers claim — that Evers supports a 50 percent cut -- Walkers campaign cites an exchange during a July 12, 2018 debate between Democrats who were running for governor. A reference was made to the group Milwaukee Inner-City Congregations Allied for Hope. Moderator: The multi-racial interfaith organization MICAH launched a campaign in 2011 to cut the state prison population by half, from 22,000 to 11,000. It now sits at 23,000. Do you support that original goal, and how would you balance reducing the prison population — Evers: Absolutely, and that's a goal thats worth accomplishing  We have to stop people incarcerating people for non-violent crimes. The Walker campaign argues that Evers response means he is committing to a 50 percent reduction over four years because MICAHs website refers to a campaign in 2011 to get the 50 percent cut by 2015. But neither the question to Evers, nor his response, mentions four years. And we found no evidence that Evers has committed to any time frame. Evers has said Wisconsin should cut parole revocations and expand drug courts as ways of reducing the number of people being sent to prison. He has also said he would consider releasing some inmates early; treating 17-year-olds as juveniles instead of adults for criminal charges; and overhauling truth-in-sentencing so prisoners could be released for good behavior. Kenneth Streit, a clinical professor of law emeritus at the University of Wisconsin Law School, told us its possible to achieve a 50 percent cut without releasing inmates convicted of violent crimes — or at least not thousands of them. Streit has studied corrections policy since 1990 and has assisted the Legislature and the Department of Corrections in developing and evaluating adult community corrections programs. He said the population could be reduced by about 5 percent annually over the next decade through steps such as changing sentencing guidelines and tripling funding for treatment-based probation that would reduce the number of people going back to prison for probation revocations.  Whether a 10-year time frame, or longer, would be acceptable to advocates for the 50 percent reduction is unclear; many want a quicker turnaround. But, despite Walkers claim, its also not clear that Evers would seek a 50 percent cut over a period that would force the release of thousands of inmates convicted of violent crimes. One more point before we close: Ryan King, research director at the nonprofit Justice Policy Institute, who formerly did studies for the Urban Institute and the Pew Research Center, said research shows that people who are in prison for violence are less likely to be rearrested after release than people sentenced for other offenses. Walker says Evers wants to cut Wisconsin's prison population in half, a dangerous plan that today would mean releasing thousands of violent criminals back into our communities. Evers has stated that a 50 percent reduction is a goal. But he has not put a time frame on achieving that — a crucial factor in determining whether inmates of convicted of violent crimes would have to be released. Experts say a 50 percent reduction over a relatively short period, say a few years, would require the release of inmates convicted of violent crimes. But some say its possible to cut the population in half, perhaps over 10 years, without the release of any violent offenders, or at least not thousands of them.For a statement that is partially accurate, our rating is Half True.",0.5,0.7,0.9,0.6,0.8,0.7,0.4,0.6,0.5,Half True

Final Rating: Half True",Says Massachusetts has three state-mandated student tests and Finland just one.,"Saying Texas students face too many state-mandated exams, an East Texas member of the State Board of Education suggested two faraway places enjoy stellar results with minimal government-imposed testing.In an opinion column published in the Dec. 10, 2012, Austin American-Statesman, Thomas Ratliff, R-Mount Pleasant, said: Massachusetts, the envy of all public school systems in the United States, has three state-mandated tests. Finland, which is the envy of all public school systems in the world, has one. Thats right, one.We're not going to judge the merits of educational systems. But we have experience counting tests.Yet, as we tucked into this Massachusetts-Finland shout, we noticed Ratliffs article does not say if hes critical of every exam given under the State of Texas Assessments of Academic Readiness system. That testing starts in the third grade.By phone, Ratliff told us that he was thinking only of the state's 11 to 15 newly-installed end-of-course exams that high-school students must hurdle to qualify for graduation.So, what of Massachusetts and Finland?Ratliff said he drew his Massachusetts test count from Austin lawyer Dineen Majcher, who helped launch Texans Advocating for Meaningful Student Assessment amid concerns the 2009 Legislature's overhaul of student testing and accountability went overboard.Majcher pointed us to a Massachusetts government web page, for the Bay States Department of Elementary and Secondary Education, indicating that high-school students should attain proficient scores on tests in English language arts and math and a test in any of several science-oriented subjects: biology, chemistry, introductory physics or technology/engineering. Students who do not meet the states proficient score on either test can still graduate, according to the agency, by fulfilling an educational proficiency plan entailing more classwork and testing.By email, department spokesman J.C. Considine told us that outside of the states high-school tests, students in grades three through eight must take standardized state exams. According to an agency web page, results are used to hold schools accountable for progress toward the federal goal that all U.S. students be proficient in reading and math by 2014.Now lets flip to Finland.Ratliff pointed us to an article in the September 2011 issue of Smithsonian, the magazine produced by the Smithsonian Institution, saying that students there have outperformed counterparts in other countries thanks to in a focus on well-prepared teachers who decide how best to school their individual pupils. The story also says there are no mandated standardized tests in Finland, apart from one exam at the end of students senior year in high school.The test is the Finnish Matriculation Exam, according to a Finnish government web page, which says the exams purpose is to discover whether pupils have assimilated the knowledge and skills required by the curriculum for the upper secondary school and whether they have reached an adequate level of maturity in line with that school`s goals. Passing the Matriculation Examination entitles the candidate to continue his or her studies at university.According to the web page, the exam is given each spring and fall.However, the exam is not a one-and-done. Its composed of at least four tests, one that each student must take in his or her mother tongue—Finnish, Swedish or Saami—and three others at their choice either on the second national language or a foreign language; math; or a test in the sciences and humanities, according to the web page, including tests in Evangelical Lutheran religion, Orthodox religion, ethics, philosophy, psychology, history, social studies, physics, chemistry, biology, geography and health education.As part of his or her examination, the candidate may additionally include one or more optional tests, the web page says.Whoa. Could each student really take more than 10 tests?Pasi Sahlberg, a Finnish expert in education and director general of the Helsinki-based Centre for International Mobility and Cooperation, confirmed by email that the overall standardized exam consists of a minimum of four tests, but students if they wish can take more exams. Typically, he said, students take five or six tests. These may be spread over a 12-month period, he said, though most students take most of their tests in the spring of their last school year. Notably, too, Sahlberg emailed, Finnish students who focus on vocational training after completing the countrys nine mandatory years of basic education do not have to take a state-mandated exam of any kind. In 2010, 45 percent of the students who continued their schooling after the nine years chose the vocational track, Satu Mäki-Lassila of Finlands Ministry of Education and Culture told us by email.Our rulingRatliff wrote that Massachusetts has three mandated student tests and Finland one.Both claims reflect the exams that students in Massachusetts and Finland have to take to qualify for high school graduation.But students on the academic track in Finland must take at least four separate tests. Also, given that Ratliffs article does not say hes speaking only to tests administered in high school, its worth noting that Massachusetts, like Texas, requires students starting in third grade to take state tests.This claim grades out as Half True. CLARIFICATION, 10:00 a.m., Dec. 19, 2012: We amended this article to point out that Finnish students who focus on vocational courses at the secondary level do not have to take a government-mandated exam to graduate.

Final Rating: Half True  ",The income tax that started at 2 percent under Governor Byrne is now 9 percent.,"Whet the appetite of liberal politicians with a new tax and Gov. Chris Christie warns theyll become ravenous. Thats why Christie told a crowd in New Hampshire they should vote on Nov. 6 for Ovide Lamontagne, the Republican candidate for governor of the Granite State. Otherwise New Hampshire, which doesnt tax wages, may go the way of New Jersey.Christie said 35 years ago New Jersey also didnt have an income tax, but then Governor Brendan Byrne, a Democrat, said if you just give me a small income tax, just a little one, I will lower your property taxes, for the people who have the highest property taxes in America back in 1977. So 35 years later, what have we got? We still have the highest property taxes in America and the income tax that started at 2 percent under Governor Byrne is now 9 percent -- 9 percent.Here's the key everybody: you let a liberal politician in the door and give them permission to give you a new tax, they only know one direction for that tax to go and that's up, Christie said at the Sept. 25 event.Did New Jerseys income tax more than quadruple since it was first enacted, as Christie said?The governors statement is partially accurate because a group of individuals -- those earning more than $500,000 in taxable income -- are now subject to a statutory income tax rate of 8.97 percent.But those individuals represent only a small percentage of filers in New Jersey and the tax rates are lower for other income levels. The governors office did not respond to requests for comment, but the history of the states income tax is clear.In 1976 -- during Byrnes first term -- the state passed a temporary income tax with two rates. A 2 percent rate was levied on income less than $20,000 or about $80,000 in todays dollars, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. Income in excess of $20,000 was taxed at the top rate of 2.5 percent. A year after the temporary tax was enacted, the state made it permanent. Over time New Jersey modeled its income tax into a more progressive system, which now has rates ranging from 1.4 percent to 8.97 percent depending on income level and filing status.The states top rate is 8.97 percent, which only applies to income in excess of $500,000. Less than 2 percent of taxable New Jersey resident returns in 2009 had that level of income, according to state Treasury Department data. An individual with taxable income between $75,000 and $500,000 pays a 6.37 percent rate on that income. For income between $40,000 and $75,000, the rate is about 5.5 percent.The lowest rates are 1.4 percent and 1.75 percent, which are lower than the states rates in 1976. Those rates apply to incomes below $20,000 or between $20,000 and $35,000, respectively.So for Christie to suggest the income tax, in general, jumped from 2 percent to 9 percent is misleading. Thats true for one income level, but the statement oversimplifies New Jerseys current income tax system.Our rulingChristie said, The income tax that started at 2 percent under Governor Byrne is now 9 percent.When the state first implemented an income tax in 1976, two rates existed -- 2 percent for income less than $20,000 and 2.5 percent for income more than $20,000 -- but the state has since introduced a more progressive tax system. New Jerseys top rate is nearly 9 percent now, but applies only to taxable income above $500,000.Every other income bracket is subject to a rate lower than 9 percent, with some income levels charged a rate of less than 2 percent.To comment on this ruling, go to NJ.com.

Final Rating: Half True  ","Less than two years ago, we made a commitment to repay the U.S. . . .taxpayers in full, and today we made good on that promise.","In an announcement reminiscent of one made by GM around this time last year, Chrysler Group LLC boasted this week that it had paid back money lent to it by the American government, with interest, six years ahead of schedule.President Barack Obama, who is expected to highlight the milestone in a visit to a Toledo, Ohio, Chrysler plant on June 3, called the repayment a significant milestone for the turnaround of Chrysler and the countless communities and families who rely on the American auto industry. He and other Democrats adopted an I-told-you-so stance, with some Democrats taking the opportunity to remind the public that many Republicans opposed the auto bailouts.In a press release from Chrysler Group LLC announcing the loan repayment, the company's Chief Executive Officer Sergio Marchionne stated, Less than two years ago, we made a commitment to repay the U.S. and Canadian taxpayers in full, and today we made good on that promise.For this item, we're going to focus on whether the company repaid U.S. taxpayers. Chrysler Group LLC repaid $5.1 billion in Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) loans and formally terminated its ability to draw from a remaining $2.1 billion line of credit extended through TARP. Together with interest and fees, Chrysler Group has now paid $6.5 billion to the U.S. Treasury. It borrowed $5.1 billion from the U.S. government when it began operations under new ownership in June 2009. In addition, the U.S. Treasury still holds a 6.6 percent common equity stake in Chrysler Group.So is Chrysler now really square with the American taxpayer?The press release doesn't mention it, but there's more to the government's investment in Chrysler than the loans to Chrysler Group LLC.In its own press release about Chrysler's loan repayment, the U.S. Department of Treasury lays out a more complete picture of taxpayer support of Chrysler:Treasury committed a total of $12.5 billion to Chrysler under TARPs Automotive Industry Financing Program (AIFP), the release states. With todays transaction, Chrysler has returned more than $10.6 billion of that amount to taxpayers through principal repayments, interest, and cancelled commitments. Treasury continues to hold a 6.6 percent common equity stake in Chrysler. As previously stated, however, Treasury is unlikely to fully recover its remaining outstanding investment of $1.9 billion in Chrysler.In an interview with MSNBC's Andrea Mitchell on May 24, 2011, Ron Bloom, assistant to President Obama in charge of manufacturing policy, broke it down more plainly:Today, Chrysler is reducing their obligation to the U.S. taxpayer by $8 billion. They have previously provided us with $2.6 billion of funds. So, that $10.6 (billion) stacks up against $8.5 billion that the president invested in Chrysler and $4 billion from the prior administration. So, that's over 100 percent of all monies that this administration invested and about 85 percent of the total invested funds by the United States government.So how can the Chrysler Group LLC claim to have squared its obligation to the American taxpayers when only 85 percent of the taxpayers' investment in Chrysler has been recouped?Notice how we keep writing Chrysler Group LLC. There's a reason for that. That's the new Chrysler company that emerged from bankruptcy in 2009.We'll let Gualberto Ranieri, head of communications for the Chrysler Group LLC, explain.Ranieri likened the generic use of the word Chrysler to a fruit salad, which is made up of lots of different fruits: apples, strawberries, blueberries...you get the idea. When you talk about Chrysler, there's not just one company. There's the old Chrysler, the company that was liquidated in bankruptcy. There's the new Chrysler, aka Chrysler Group LLC, the newly formed company that purchased most of the assets of Old Chrysler in a bankruptcy sale. There's also the financing firms Chrysler Financial and GMAC.We are not responsible for the old Chrysler, Ranieri said. We are not responsible for Chrysler Financial. I am not responsible for my brother's loans, even though we have the same last name.Chrysler Group CEO Marchionne can only speak for the new company, Ranieri said, and the government money extended to Chrysler Group has been fully repaid, with interest.That's technically true, Edward Niedermeyer, editor-in-chief of The Truth About Cars website wrote this week. It does, however, fail to account (again) for the $1.9 billion Debtor-in-Possession 'loan' which financed Chrysler during bankruptcy and was conveniently left to die with the remains of 'Old Chrysler.' Nor does it account for the $1.5 billion loaned to Chryslers suppliers to keep them afloat amidst the bailout chaos.Chrysler and its political bedfellows should be forgiven for a little cheering, Niedermeyer wrote. The loan repayment is a positive sign of hope for a once seemingly doomed company.Its just that taxpayers still deserve a full and transparent accounting of 'every penny' (to borrow a phrase) that actually went into Chrysler, not just 'loans made in the last two years' or 'loans made by the Obama Administration' or other weasel-wordings employed to make the bailout seem more successful than it is, Niedermeyer wrote. Though bailout supporters will doubtless argue that 'it doesnt matter' because Chrysler is alive today and 'thats what matters,' this doesnt justify a lack of transparency. In fact, if the bailout was successful because GM and Chrysler survived, thats all the more reason to not fear the truth about what the bailout actually cost.James Gattuso, a senior research fellow in regulatory policy at the conservative Heritage Foundation, said there was nearly $2 billion in taxpayer money that went down with the ship with the old shell of Chrysler. Technically, he said, Chrysler Group LLC is a different company. But from a taxpayers' perspective, there's little distinction.If the taxpayers were a bank, they wouldn't stay in business very long, he said. The taxpayers took a loss, or they are still in the red at least.Now, the U.S. Treasury still owns a 6.6 percent common equity stake in Chrysler Group. That has an undetermined value, as the company has not yet gone public. But as the Treasury itself acknowledged, Treasury is unlikely to fully recover its remaining outstanding investment of $1.9 billion in Chrysler.We asked Lawrence J. White, a professor of economics at the Stern School of Business at New York University what he made of Marchionne's statement.This certainly appears to be another instance of careful language, where all of Chrysler's statement is focused on loans to Chrysler but not the other Treasury investments, White said. Yes, this appears to be an incomplete statement.As we noted earlier, the statements made by Marchionne were similar to those made by General Motors CEO Ed Whitacre last year. But the situations are different. For one, the government took a much larger equity stake in GM. For more details, see our fact-check related to Whitacre's claims last year.Again, there may be cause for celebratory comments from Chrysler. But Marchionne's statement, while technically accurate, doesn't tell the full story. Yes, Chrysler Group LLC has fully repaid the loans made to it two years ago. But that's not the full measure of the American taxpayers' investments to try to save Chrysler, including $2 billion to old Chrysler that was wiped out in bankruptcy. We doubt taxpayers care much about the distinctions in corporate titles. The government has now gotten most of its money back, but not all of it. Not yet anyway. UPDATE: The original version of this article mentioned Canadian taxpayers in the quotation. But since we are focusing on U.S, contributions, the reference to Canada was removed from the statement.",0.5,0.5,1,0.5,0,0.5,0.5,1,0.5,Half True

Final Rating: Mostly False  ",Virginia is one of only a handful of states that actually taxes our veterans retirement.,"Gov. Glenn Youngkin recently visited the Leesburg Diner in Loudoun County to rally public support for a series of tax cuts pending in the General Assembly. One item on his agenda is cutting state income taxes on military pensions. We are one of only a handful of states that actually taxes our veterans retirement, Youngkin, a Republican, told the crowd on Feb. 17. Youngkins press secretary, Macaulay Porter, told us the governors information comes from Military Benefits, a privately-run website that specializes in what its name says. We found almost identical information on another private site called The Military Wallet. Virginia is among three states that fully tax military pensions, according to the web sites. It joins California and Vermont. Another 12 states tax the retirement pay, but at reduced levels. All told, 15 states including Virginia tax military pensions in some way. Thats certainly more than the imprecise handful Youngkin claimed. Nine states have no income tax, while 26 with the levy fully exempt military pensions. The House and the Senate unanimously passed bills in February that would reduce - but not end - the state income tax on veteran pensions. Because the bills are different, the chambers will have to work out a compromise. The House bill follows Youngkins proposal to shield from taxation up to $40,000 a year in pensions. The plan would be phased in over three years, with $20,000 protected in this year and $30,000 next year. Fully implemented in 2024, the plan would save military veterans as much as $2,500 a year, depending on their other income. It would cost the state about $250 million a year. The Senate bill is less generous. It would be limited to military retirees who are at least 60 and would shield up to $20,000 from income taxes - half as much as the House. The plan would be phased in over four years. Fully implemented in 2025, it would save military retirees as much as $1,250 a year, depending on their other income. It would cost the state $122 million a year. Youngkin garbled facts when he said, We are one of only a handful of states that actually taxes our veterans retirement. Virginia is one of three states that fully tax military pensions. Twelve more states tax the pensions at reduced rates, which is what Youngkin wants to do in Virginia. All told, 15 states tax military pensions. Thats a minority, but certainly more than the handful Youngkin describes. ",0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,Mostly False

Final Rating: Half True  ",Says Austin has the lowest property tax rate by far of the five major cities in Texas.,"Two days before city staffers discussed raising Austins property tax levy, Mayor Lee Leffingwell touted the citys rate in a televised debate.Facing off against mayoral opponents Brigid Shea and Clay Dafoe in an April 16, 2012, forum on KXAN-TV, Channel 36, Leffingwell said, The City of Austin has the lowest property tax rate by far of the five major cities in Texas, including Fort Worth, Houston, Dallas and San Antonio.Does that add up?By email, Leffingwell campaign consultant Mark Littlefield and city spokesman Reyne Telles told us that Leffingwell used data from a chart prepared by city staff for its annual five-year financial forecast. Littlefield sent us that chart plus a second one showing estimated tax bills in each city.Ed Van Eenoo, Austins city budget officer, told us by email that his office created the charts with 2011 tax rates, home values and sales price information from county appraisal districts and the Real Estate Center at Texas A&M University.We checked the numbers with the districts and center, and found Austins property tax rate was the lowest, considerably, of Texas five biggest cities, as Leffingwell said. The full list: Fort Worth, 85.5 cents per $100 of appraised value; Dallas, 79.7 cents; Houston, 63.875 cents; San Antonio, 56.5569 cents, Austin, 48.11 cents.But tax rates are only part of the equation when it comes to figuring out how hard a homeowners pocketbook gets hit.Here, in fact, is the equation, from Austins budget office: Take your houses dollar value; subtract any homestead or other exemptions; divide by 100; then multiply by the tax rate -- with the tax rate expressed in dollars; for example, 0.4811 rather than 48.11 cents.We calculated how much typical homeowners had to pay in 2011 using two different measures: average appraised values from each county tax appraisal districts, and median sales price from the center, which gets data from real estate professionals across the state. Although exemptions affect many tax bills, we excluded them here because they vary with each homeowner and each city, county and taxing jurisdiction. In 2011, Austin had both the highest median sale price and the highest average appraised value among the five cities. But because of the citys low tax rate, Austins tax bill (excluding exemptions) on an average-value home was second-highest, and its tax bill on a median sales-price home came in fourth.Calculated using 2011 median sales price and 2011 city tax rate, Dallas had the highest bill -- $1,262 on a $158,400 house -- followed by Houstons $982 on a $153,700 house, Fort Worths $946 bill on a $110,600 house, Austins $918 on a $190,900 house and San Antonios $856 on a $151,300 house.Using the same tax rates and 2011s average appraised values, Dallas was first again, with a $1,441 bill on a $180,847 house, followed by Austins $1,224 bill on a $254,328 house, Houstons $1,057 on a $165,535 house, Fort Worths $968 on a $113,247 house and San Antonios $725 on a $128,151 house.  Because averages can be skewed by a few very high or low values, taking the median value offers a way to dampen the effect of those extremes. Medians represent a middle value -- median sales price would be the dollar amount at which half a city's homes sold for more and half sold for less.The city's tax bill chart used median sales prices, except for Austin, where the median appraised home value was available, and factored in homestead exemptions. Reckoned that way, Austins tax bill again came out second-highest.Of course, cities are only one of the entities taking a chomp out of your property taxes. Depending on where your house is, county government, school districts, community colleges and possibly many others get a bite.The Austin owner of a $190,900 home in 2011, for example, paid $2,371 to the Austin school district; $927 to Travis County; $181 to Austin Community College; and $151 to Central Health (Travis Countys healthcare district) on top of the $918 city tax bill.Also, Austinites recently learned that 2013 might bring an increase in the citys rate. The Austin American-Statesman reported April 18 that the owner of a median-value home would pay $33 more under a tax rate of 49.95 cents per $100 of property -- the rate city staffers said Austin would need to cover its costs next year.Leffingwell responded to the news with a statement that he would look for ways to cut spending rather than raise the property tax rate.That 49.95-cent rate for 2012 is still lower than the other cities 2011 rates, but its too early to know what all the 2012 rates -- and home values -- will be.Our rulingLeffingwells right on the rates. Austin had the lowest 2011 city property tax rate among Texas five biggest cities.Yet rates alone are not the only, or even best, indicator of how much residents have been socked by property taxes. Comparing each citys average-value home in 2011, for instance, Austin would have extracted the second-highest tax payment.Without this context, Leffingwells rate comparison misrepresents this pocketbook issue.

Final Rating: Mostly True  ","Under the leadership of @WVGovernor Justice, West Virginia now has the highest rate of COVID-19 spread from person to person than any other state.","In a thread of tweets posted July 10, the West Virginia Democratic Party blames Republican Gov. Jim Justice for the states jump in the rate of person-to-person transmission of the novel coronavirus. Under the leadership of @WVGovernor Justice, West Virginia now has the highest rate of COVID-19 spread from person to person than any other state, the tweet begins. The thread pointed to an announcement by Clay Marsh, the vice president and executive dean of West Virginia University Health Sciences, that the state was ranked No. 1 nationally in the rate of transmission. Today Dr. Clay Marsh announced that WV has the highest RT rate of any other state in the U.S., the thread says. This means that WV is spreading COVID-19 from person to person faster than any other state in the country. Bureau of Public Health commissioner Cathy Slemp, who resigned under pressure in late June, tried to warn Justice of this days before she was fired. 🆘😷🆘 Under the leadership of @WVGovernor Justice, West Virginia now has the highest rate of COVID-19 spread from person to person than any other state.  Does West Virginia, the last state in the country to confirm a positive COVID-19 case, now top the country in the rate of transmission? It does, though the tweet lacks important context about the spread of the virus in the state and the country as a whole. The West Virginia Democratic Party did not respond to inquiries for this article, but we did reach Marsh to discuss the relationship between the rate of transmission and the growth in coronavirus cases. He said scientists use two related but distinct measurements to study the spread infections such as COVID-19. One is R0, pronounced R-naught, and the other is known as Rt, or the effective reproduction number. Both measure how many people, on average, one infected person will infect. But they measure slightly different things. R0 captures how fundamentally infectious a germ is when its introduced into a new population. By contrast, Rt measures how much the infection is spreading at a particular moment in time, taking into account factors such as the percentage of people who have already become infected and the preventive measures being taken against the infection. With both of these scores, any rate that is more than 1 suggests that the disease is spreading, and any rate below 1 suggests that it is reducing, Marsh told PolitiFact. On July 10, the day the Democratic Partys tweet was posted, Marsh told WVMetroNews that the states Rt had increased from the nations second lowest rate two and a half months earlier to second-worst in the country. By that afternoon, CNN had posted an article citing Marsh and reporting that West Virginia had climbed to No. 1 nationally in Rt. Marsh told PolitiFact that Rt is valuable for showing which direction the states level of infections could be heading in the following weeks. But other metrics are important as well, he said. Marsh said he pays attention to the positivity rate -- the percentage of newly tested people whose results come back positive for the virus. The countries and states that have been most successful have kept this measurement below 3%, and West Virginia has toggled between 3% and 5% recently. (West Virginia is also one of only 11 states that are performing an adequate number of tests to control the spread, according to a New York Times analysis.) Marsh said he also looks at the total change in the number of cases, using a 7-day or 14-day rolling average, and how close in-state hospitals are to their capacity for the number of ICU beds and ventilators In other words, Rt gives researchers an idea about how fast the disease is spreading, but its not the only key to understanding the virus. AndyShi and Xihong Lin from the Harvard Chan School of Public Health agree with Marshs assessment in an email interview with PolitiFact. Ultimately, what we are doing is we are trying to take a look at, how do we measure today versus how did we measure a week ago, or two weeks ago, or a month ago, because that gives us a better idea about how our risk is changing, Marsh said. The West Virginia Democratic Party tweeted, Under the leadership of @WVGovernor Justice, West Virginia now has the highest rate of COVID-19 spread from person to person than any other state. On the day the tweet was posted, West Virginia did have one of the highest rates of transmission of any state. However, using this metric communicates only one part of the picture of how hard West Virginia is getting hit by the coronavirus. Among other measurements, the absolute number of coronavirus cases ranks far below the level seen in current hot-spot states like Arizona, Florida, and Texas. And the states positivity rate for test results is close to the low level that experts like to see.",0.7,0.5,1.0,0.6,0.3,0.4,0.5,1.0,0.4,Mostly True

Final Rating: Half True",Two-thirds of our kids cant read at grade level.,"Republican presidential candidate Marco Rubio pulled out a stunning statistic about the current state of K-12 education while making the case for school choice. Two-thirds of our kids cant read at grade level, Rubio wrote in a recent Medium post. We wondered whether the situation in American schools was really that bad, so we took a closer look. Rubios source was the National Assessment of Educational Progress, or NAEP, a closely watched, federally sponsored standardized-testing effort. The most recent NAEP data for fourth- and eighth-grade students covers 2015. It offers four categories of achievement. From lowest to highest, they are below basic, basic, proficient, and advanced. The two most relevant categories for this fact-check are basic and proficient, and neither levels definition mentions reading on grade level. Basic is defined as denoting partial mastery of prerequisite knowledge and skills that are fundamental for proficient work at each grade assessed. Proficient is defined as representing solid academic performance for each grade assessed and competency over challenging subject matter, including subject-matter knowledge, application of such knowledge to real-world situations, and analytical skills appropriate to the subject matter. Rubio is using the proficient level as his benchmark, and the picture that produces isnt pretty. In 2015, just 36 percent of American fourth graders were categorized as either proficient or advanced in reading. Heres the chart:  And that same year, just 34 percent of eighth graders rated as either proficient or advanced in reading. Heres the chart:  Using that metric, Rubio supports his point. But education experts advised caution. Most important is that its a bit of a stretch for Rubio to equate a NAEP rating of proficient with being at grade level. There is no commonly accepted definition for what grade level performance is or should be, said Christopher B. Swanson, vice president of Editorial Projects in Education, which publishes Education Week. NAEP, he said, is developed independently of the knowledge required by any specific state, district or school. David Bills, a professor of education at the University of Iowa, agreed. As far as I know, no one has ever tested those labels against what kids actually need to know to do well in school, Bills said. Indeed, after the No Child Left Behind education law was enacted under President George W. Bush, each state had to choose a level of proficiency, and on average, this came closer to the NAEP basic level, said Eric Hanushek, a senior fellow in education policy at the conservative Hoover Institution. If this is the case, then one could instead use the basic level under NAEP and find that the success rates are 69 percent and 76 percent for fourth and eighth graders, respectively. Still, despite such words of caution, experts said Rubios decision to use the proficient level as his benchmark was defensible. Experts also ratified Rubios use of the NAEP tests as his data source. Sure, there are lots of problems and its not a perfect measure, but that doesnt mean its meaningless in all contexts, said Patricia M. Cooper, an associate professor and program coordinator for early childhood education at Queens College-City University of New York. There arent many credible alternatives to the NAEP numbers, she said. Cooper added that even the best-case scenario isnt that great. Even if Rubios off by half, that means one-third of our kids arent reading on grade level, she said. Would that make us feel better? Our ruling Rubio said that two-thirds of our kids cant read at grade level. The numbers from the NAEP reading test for fourth and eighth graders provide some support for his statement. However, experts said that there is no accepted definition of what being at grade level means under the NAEP tests. While Rubio's use of NAEP's higher proficient standard is a reasonable choice, experts said, it's not the only one -- many states have set standards aligned with NAEP's basic level instead.",0.5,0.5,1,0.5,0,0.5,0.5,1,0.5,Half True

Final Rating: Mostly True  ","According to a national survey, transit ridership among people age 16 to 34 increased 40 percent between 2001 and 2009.","Supporters of a tax to improve the regions roads and transit are asking metro Atlantans to think of the children.A transportation overhaul would create a better Atlanta for generations to come, said Jeff Dickerson, a communications consultant for Citizens for Transportation Mobility, which advocates for the penny-per-dollar sales tax.Whats more, it would create the kind of transportation system younger people want, Dickerson said during an online debate on PBA.org, the website for Atlantas public television and National Public Radio stations. Look at this number from the National Household Travel Survey, Dickerson said. Between 2001 and 2009 ... ridership among young people age 16 to 34 on transit increased 40 percent over eight years.Increased 40 percent? Sounds like those young whippersnappers arent spending much time behind the wheel of Daddys T-Bird.The referendum is up for a vote July 31 and would raise $7.2 billion over 10 years to upgrade roads and transit across the region.We called up Dickerson and took a closer look at the data, which comes from the U.S. Department of Transportation.The National Household Travel Survey tracks how and why people travel. It takes place sporadically. The most recent ones were conducted in 2001 and 2009.In April of this year, the consumer group U.S. PIRG, a federation of state public interest research groups, and Frontier Group, an environmental think tank, issued Transportation and the New Generation, a report that analyzed data from this and other surveys. We found Dickerson used the correct percentage.The report found that the average number of miles traveled on transit by a person in this age group increased by 40 percent between 2001 and 2009. Our own analysis of NHTS data and the reports calculation confirms this. In fact, the surveys other findings indicate these bright young things are relying on ways to travel that dont involve a car. The number of bike trips per person in Generation Y is up about 27 percent, NHTS data said. Walking increased about 16 percent.Meanwhile, the average number of trips these youngsters take in personal vehicles declined about 18 percent, according to the survey. The miles they travel is down 23 percent. Backers of public transit list a host of reasons why.The report says higher gas prices have pushed younger people to try other means of transportation, as have more stringent state age requirements for drivers licenses.Darnell Grisby, director of policy development and research with the American Public Transportation Association, a transit industry group, mentioned findings by a real estate market research company that show that members of Generation Y overwhelmingly prefer walkable communities, whether in the suburbs or city. Also, the share of teenagers with drivers licenses has dropped in recent decades.In 1983, about 87 percent of 19-year-olds had their licenses, according to a University of Michigan study. By 2008, 75 percent did.But one NHTS finding about transit use made us wonder whether the dramatic statistic Dickerson used during the debate told the whole story. While the average number of person miles that younger people travel on transit skyrocketed, the number of trips they took on transit did not. These increased by only about 4 percentIt appears that 16- to 34-year-olds are hopping on public trains and buses slightly more often but are taking much longer trips.Why might this be? Baruch Feigenbaum is a transportation policy analyst for the Reason Foundation, a think tank that favors free-market solutions to policy issues.Since such a small percentage of Americans use transit on their daily commutes, a small jump in the number of people who ride buses and trains might translate into a big percentage increase.While transit usage has increased, the gains may not be as impressive as they appear, Feigenbaum said.How do we rule?We found that the number of per capita passenger miles traveled did increase by 40 percent, the number Dickerson used.But Dickersons use of the word ridership might have led viewers to think that younger people are taking 40 percent more trips on transit. This number ticked up by only about 4 percent.By either NHTS measure, its fair to say that younger people are leaving Daddys T-Bird in the driveway and relying more heavily on transit.But Dickerson could have been much more precise.For this reason, Dickerson earns a Half True.",1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,Mostly True

Final Rating: Mostly True  ","Florida retirees and families lost tens of thousands of dollars in deposits on failed Trump condo projects, but he pocketed their money and walked away.","Democratic vice presidential nominee Tim Kaine questioned Donald Trumps business ethics, saying the Republican presidential candidate swindled customers in a past real estate deal in the Sunshine State. Retirees and families in Florida — they believed Donald Trump when he said he'd build them some condos. Thousands of them, Kaine said on the third night of the Democratic National Convention. They paid their deposits, but the condos, they were never built. He just pocketed their money and walked away. They lost tens of thousands of dollars, all because they believed Donald Trump. A Kaine spokesman told us the senator was referring to not one, but two failed condo projects: One in Tampa and one in Fort Lauderdale. Trumps campaign did not respond. We wanted to know if people lost tens of thousands of dollars in deposits while Trump took the money without consequence. Since there are two projects, well take them one at a time. Trump Tower Tampa In 2004, at the height of the Tampa real estate boom, local developers incorporated under the name SimDag/Robel contacted Trump to ask him to partner on a condo tower they wanted to build. The group eventually reached a licensing agreement with Trump: He would lend his name to Trump Tower Tampa for $2 million plus a percentage of condo sales. The document stipulated that neither the developers nor Trump would under any circumstances disclose or permit to be disclosed the existence of this agreement.'' No one would know Trumps involvement was in name only. Trump announced the deal on Jan. 10, 2005, saying he would partner with SimDag/Robel to build a 52-story, 190-unit condo tower in downtown Tampa. (Less than two weeks later, Trump married Slovenian model Melania Knauss in a Palm Beach wedding attended by now-rival Hillary Clinton.) The next month, Trump and his new bride attended a sales launch in Tampa. Trump told reporters at a gala reception with 600 guests that he had a substantial stake in the project and that units were selling well. Now, its here well note that Kaine said in his speech there were thousands of them, which his spokesman said was referring to thousands of dollars. By the time Trump came to Tampa, customers had placed sizable deposits on all 190 units, which cost between $700,000 and $6 million. The amount of those deposits varied depending on the unit. With 190 units, Kaines description of the customers as retirees and families is a plausible definition. Tampa Bay Times reporter Susan Taylor Martin noted customers included doctors, NFL coaches, a video game developer and more. Under the sales agreement, half of the deposit cash went into an escrow account, while the other half went to construction costs. But the project ran over budget quickly. The site required a redesign of the foundation, and construction issues soon ballooned the cost of the project from initially being $227 million to $300 million. In 2006, the developers held a groundbreaking, but had yet to secure financing. Trumps licensing agreement was modified that year, giving him $4 million but conceding a cut of the sales. SimDag/Robel stopped paying, and Trump sued in May 2007, claiming he was owed $1.03 million in licensing fees. That lawsuit was the first indication for buyers that Trump was only slapping his name on the project. SimDag/Robel countersued Trump for breaking the confidentiality of the licensing agreement by complaining publicly about the project. Trump and the developers settled in 2008. SimDag/Robel called off the entire project and declared bankruptcy. Buyers, meanwhile, were out of luck. While the escrow half of their deposits was returned, the other half had been eaten up by construction costs. Some customers were out as much as $250,000 or more. Several dozen buyers sued Trump in 2009, arguing that they had been misled with fraudulent and negligent misrepresentations that the billionaire was more involved with the project bearing his name. Within three years, the buyers in the lawsuit reached settlements. Some were repaid as little as $11,115, according to the Times. Other buyers not a part of the suit received nothing. Jay McLaughlin, a physical therapist from Connecticut, told the Times he lost almost $90,000. An attorney named Mary Ann Stiles told the newspaper she was out $200,000. Other investors who gave SimDag/Robel money said they lost six- and seven-figure sums. Trump International Hotel & Tower Fort Lauderdale A similar scenario played out on Floridas Atlantic coast, when Trump struck a secretive deal with a group of developers to lend his name to a building. The Trump International Hotel & Tower Fort Lauderdale was slated to be a 24-story, 298-unit condo hotel, in which owners rent out their units like hotel rooms. When the project was unveiled in 2004, units cost between $500,000 and $3 million, with 20 percent deposits required. Buyers were wooed with brochures touting Trumps involvement, including one in which Trump said the resort was the finest and most luxurious experience I have created. Units sold well through 2006, and these deposits were split the same way as Trump Tower Tampa. Also like Tampa, construction costs soon spiraled out of control. The building was slated to be finished by December 2007 but was nowhere near done. Then one of the developing partners, Bayrock Group, sold its interest to an Icelandic investment firm for $50 million. The following year, Trump began to voice major concerns to development partner Roy Stillman of SB Hotel Associates that work wasnt being completed, despite some $140 million being spent on construction. The real estate market began its tailspin and the partners had difficulty securing more financing. In 2009, Trump decided to strip his name off the project after Stillman attempted to close with buyers to get more money, even though the building wasnt yet completed. With $185 million in debt and no billionaire name recognition, Trump International Hotel & Tower Fort Lauderdale was dead. What Trump actually made on this deal is much more obscure, because the entire project ended in more than a dozen lawsuits among Trump, the developers and the buyers. (Lawsuits against Trump also have resulted in other developments in which Trump licensed his name in places like Canada, Hawaii and Mexico.) One depositor, Naraine Seecharan, told the Miami Herald he was recovering from the removal of a brain tumor when he learned about the fate of his $289,000 down payment. J. Michael Goodson of New Jersey said he put down $345,000 and sued Trump. Pembroke Pines attorney Joseph Altschul represented more than 70 clients who said they had paid about $8 million in deposits. In all, more than 100 buyers filed lawsuits. CFLB Partnership bought the unfinished project in 2013 for $115 million, finishing the building andrenaming it the Conrad Fort Lauderdale Resort & Residences. Trump and the developers continued to argue. Trump also sued the developers, saying he lost millions in licensing and hotel management fees over the deal. He maintained in the various lawsuits he held no liability, while the partners struggled to reach settlements with buyers. (Trumps attorneys also got in trouble for hiding a $5 million insurance policy to help cover lawsuits for making misleading statements.) Well, the word developing, it doesn't mean that we're the developers, Trump said in a 2013 deposition. We worked on the documents, we worked on the room sizes and the things, but we didn't give out the contracts, we didn't get the financing, we weren't the developer, but we did work with the developer. Trump and his affiliated companies have not been found at fault in the Fort Lauderdale lawsuits, thanks to contract language that stated Trumps involvement was in name only. His legal team maintained the suits against him were more about Trumps money and anger over the housing crash. The billionaire maintained that buyers were better off losing deposit money than taking more of abath in a bad real estate investment, as the condos were worth roughly half what people would have paid in full. In one 2014 trip to the witness stand, he said someone would have to be very stupid to have still attempted to buy a condo in the building after the real estate crash. Only a fool would have closed under those circumstances, Trump said. In April 2016, a Florida appeals court ruled on the last two active cases seeking deposits. The three-judge-panel upheld prior findings that Trump did not misrepresent his role in the development. Our ruling Kaine said Florida retirees and families lost tens of thousands of dollars in deposits onfailed Trump condo projects, but he pocketed their money and walked away. Its clear that many buyers, whatever their occupation or familial status, indeed lost at least that much in the failed Trump projects in Tampa and Fort Lauderdale. Some were further compensated partially with settlements after suing the billionaire. Whether Trump cheated them is another matter. While his licensing agreements with the developers were secret, he was entitled to a certain amount of money for putting his name on the building. He was sued by several dozen angry buyers and either settled or was found not at fault, which is not the same as walking away without addressing the problems. Kaines statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/b0c3e425-5851-49f6-9bec-ecace6975c3c",0.7,0.6,0.8,0.6,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.8,0.6,Mostly True

Final Rating: Half True  ","Already, the Affordable Care Act is helping to slow the growth of (Medicares) health care costs.","In his State of the Union address, President Barack Obama warned those who love Medicare that changes to the program are needed, because rising health care costs for seniors are the biggest driver of our long-term debt.If changes arent made, Obama warned, our retirement programs will crowd out the investments we need for our children, and jeopardize the promise of a secure retirement for future generations.Obama said he was open to changes such as asking wealthier seniors to pay more, and paying hospitals and doctors to be more efficient. But he also took credit for his signature health care law.Already, the Affordable Care Act is helping to slow the growth of health care costs, he said.From our previous fact-checking, we know that many of the major provisions of the 2010 health care law have yet to take effect. So how can the law already be slowing the growth of health care costs? We decided to check it out.Slowing spendingAs Obama made his speech, the White House posted slides on its website to back up Obamas key points.For his health care comment, a chart showed Medicare spending projections from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, both before the passage of the Affordable Care Act and afterward. The chart shows the future growth noticeably slowing after the laws passage. (View the chart here.) The numbers were part of the CBO's regular update on the countrys economic outlook and the federal budget. We reviewed the latest numbers, which were released on Feb. 5, 2013, as well as news coverage of the findings.In its report, the CBO says that health care spending has grown much more slowly in recent years, both for federal programs and overall, than it did in previous years. In response to that slowing growth, the CBO reduced its projections for future Medicare spending. Since March 2010, the CBO has lowered its projections for Medicare spending in 2020 by roughly 15 percent, the report said.However, the CBO did not specifically credit the Affordable Care Act as the reason for lowering the projections. Some aspects of the law, the report said, will slightly increase federal outlays in Medicare and Medicaid.But the CBO did say it was revising estimates based on actual reduced growth in health care spending since at least 2010.Health care law phasing inAs we noted above, the health care law isnt fully in effect yet. A new requirement for Americans to get health insurance or pay a penalty won't take effect until 2014, for example.For the Medicare program, the law includes both spending and cost savings.Beneficiaries can now receive expanded prescription drug coverage and preventive care without co-pays under the law; but those benefits increase costs.On the other hand, the law has also put in place limits on payments to private insurance companies that operate the Medicare Advantage program, which saves money. Changes in payments to hospitals have also already started. That means financial incentives for hospitals that are more efficient and penalties for those that are not.When we asked White House staff for more evidence to support Obamas comments, they pointed us to a January memo from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, which specifically pointed to limits on Medicare Advantage and changes to hospital payments.Finally, a controversial Medicare payments commission -- the Independent Payment Advisory Board -- would make recommendations to make payments more efficient, reducing spending. But that board hasnt yet convened, and it may never convene if Medicare meets pre-determined budget targets.Trends in health care spendingGetting back to health care costs, its clear that the growth in spending is going down, both for overall health spending and Medicare. But whats driving it? We found that experts consider it something of an interesting puzzle.Some blame the recession and the economy. When people feel poor, they dont spend as much, even on health care. Under this scenario, health care spending will rebound when the economy is better.Others say the overall health care system is changing, moving away from payments for each procedure and test, and moving toward payments for better overall outcomes. The health care law includes provisions to encourage that switch. If this is the case, reduced spending growth should become permanent.We found a diversity of opinion on whats going on here, and whether Obamas comment was accurate.Medicare spending slowed down in 2010-12, so this is not just a projection, said Jonathan Oberlander, a professor of health policy at the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill. Much of the law is not yet implemented, yet some Affordable Care Act provisions to control Medicare spending -- like changes in what Medicare Advantage plans are paid -- are already in effect, and were expected to produce savings during 2011-12.Other experts are dubious that the law is having much effect at all, such as Yuval Levin, a fellow at the Ethics and Public Policy Center and a domestic policy staffer on health care issues for President George W. Bush.The reduction in overall health costs has had above all to do with the weak economy, and while CBO does suggest that its projections of the effects of the Affordable Care Act have changed in a few ways since it passed in 2010 (causing both upward and downward revisions of the effects on costs), those are all projections for after 2014, when the key substantive provisions of the law will take effect, he said. None of them could be used to suggest that already, the Affordable Care Act is helping to slow the growth of health care costs.The Obama administration argues that its more than a weak economy driving reductions in spending. The economic recession may have contributed to the 2010-12 decrease in growth in per beneficiary spending as consumers use less care due to its cost, says the HHS memo. However, as almost all Medicare beneficiaries have supplemental coverage and thus face relatively low out-of-pocket costs, it seems unlikely that consumer behavior alone is responsible for the slow growth in Medicare spending.Deborah Chollet, a senior fellow at Mathematica Policy Research, said the health care system is responding to the new law already. Insurance companies and other payers know about the new payment methods the law supports, and they are planning accordingly, she said.Its really not at all a situation of the lights turning on Jan. 1, 2014. The lights have been on for the past six months, she said.Still, determining causes behind the spending slowdown is no easy task, warned Bradley Herring, professor at the Bloomberg School of Public Health at Johns Hopkins University.I think most people think the slowdown weve seen in health care spending over the last three years has been due to the recession. But no ones 100 percent sure why that happened, he said.Things will get even more complicated for health policy researchers as the law deploys changes to payments and other pilot programs. Researchers will have to hypothesize how much costs decline compared with if the law had not passed.Those are going to be difficult things to measure, Herring said.Well close with comments from Douglas Elmendorf, head of the Congressional Budget Office. He spoke to reporters when the office released new numbers on Feb. 5:So, health spending has grown slowly over the past few years, both in federal programs and in the rest of the health care systems. We think that part of that owes to the recession and the loss of income in wealth, but we think that a significant part of that probably does not stem from the recession, probably arises from structural changes in the health care system.The critical question is, whether those structural changes are very transitory changes or whether they will persist. We're doing analysis to that question. We're talking with outside experts who are also investigating the same question. I think the short summary of that is that we don't know.Our rulingObama said, Already, the Affordable Care Act is helping to slow the growth of health care costs.Hes right that health care costs are slowing, but theres not conclusive evidence that the law is helping. The nonpartisan reports from the Congressional Budget Office dont specifically say that, and some aspects of the health law translate to increased spending.Among health care experts, we found debate over how much the Affordable Care Act is contributing to an overall slowdown in health spending. Some argue that the recession is making people spend less on health care. Others say the health care system is changing to become more efficient. Many say that more study is needed.Obamas taking credit for more than he can prove.",0.5,0.5,1.0,0.6,0.2,0.5,0.4,0.7,0.5,Half True

Final Rating: Half True",John McCain fought to rein in Fannie and Freddie...but Democrats blocked the reforms.,"Seeking to portray Sen. John McCain as prescient on the financial crisis, McCain's campaign unveiled anew advertisementsaying he had spotted problems with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac two years ago. John McCain fought to rein in Fannie and Freddie ... but Democrats blocked the reforms, McCain's new ad says. As evidence, the ad points to McCain's support of a bill in 2006 to strengthen oversight of Fannie and Freddie, and Democrats' opposition to that bill.Those points merit caveats, but first, some context. Fannie and Freddie, private corporations created and sponsored by Congress to lower the cost of mortgage capital, quintupled in size between 1995 and 2004, as they pioneered the practice of selling bundled mortgages in the form of securities. Federal officials in both the Bill Clinton and George W. Bush administrations sought greater authority to regulate them, but were largely stymied by Congress. In early September 2008, with home values plummeting,the government seized control of Fannie and Freddie to prevent them from failing, a move that could cost U.S. taxpayers tens of billions of dollars. McCain has taken heat for recent revelations that Freddie Mac paid a lobbying firm co-owned by his campaign manager, Rick Davis, $15,000 a month from 2005 through August 2008. But the campaign has called attention — in advertisements like this one — to McCain's support for tighter oversight of the companies. McCain did indeed co-sponsor the Federal Housing Enterprise Regulatory Reform Act of 2005, a bill that would have enhanced oversight of Freddie and Fannie. Sen. Chuck Hagel, R-Neb.,introduced the bill in January 2005 and immediately garnered co-sponsorship from two other Republican senators. McCain signed on in May 2006 after a damning federal report on accounting practices at Fannie Mae was released. If Congress does not act, American taxpayers will continue to be exposed to the enormous risk that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac pose to the housing market, the overall financial system, and the economy as a whole, he said ina statement. The National Association of Home Builders opposed the bill, as did the National Association of Realtors. Senate Democrats said they supported some form of stricter oversight, but would not support a provision of Hagel's bill that would limit the size of the company's portfolios. Negotiations stalled and the bill never made it to the floor. Does McCain's support for that bill amount to fighting to rein in Freddie and Fannie? Sort of. Others had been fighting for Fannie-and-Freddie reform for more than a decade, and McCain signed ontothe bill a year-and-a-half after it was introduced. And hereportedlydidn't do too much for the bill beyond co-sponsoring it and issuing a statement. The McCain campaign has also noted that in 2003 he was one of five Republican senators to co-sponsor a prior bill to tighten oversight of Fannie and Freddie. Still, if he fought for reform, it wasn't exactly guns-a-blazin'. Did Democrats block the reforms? More or less. They preferred a pared-down bill, and so did not support Hagel's. McCain overstates his role in pushing for Fannie and Freddie reform, and slightly oversimplifies the dynamic at work in the Senate.

Final Rating: False  ","On the night of the Wisconsin state Senate vote on the budget package, a mob showed up and busted down the door and took over the Capitol.","Addressing the Wisconsin Republican Partys annual convention on May 21, 2011, state Senate Majority Leader Scott Fitzgerald, R-Juneau, reflected on the transformational 2010 elections. The GOP swept to power, taking from Democrats the governors office as well as control of the Senate and Assembly.That election needed to happen. Our country is facing challenges we simply cant ignore, Fitzgerald told hundreds of convention-goers at a Wisconsin Dells resort.Our government is growing too fast, too big; its becoming too expensive. One out of every five people in Wisconsin are on Medicaid or Medicare. One out of every two are on some kind of government handout.One out of every two people in Wisconsin -- half the states residents -- receive a government handout?Thats a lot of Wisconsinites.We asked Fitzgeralds spokesman, Andrew Welhouse, for evidence to back up the statement. Welhouse initially said his boss claim looks wrong, but the larger conversation about entitlements and government spending is long overdue.Thats not much of a defense.Welhouse did cite this passage from an April 2011 analysis of federal data done by USA Today:A record 18.3 percent of the nation's total personal income was a payment from the government for Social Security, Medicare, food stamps, unemployment benefits and other programs in 2010. Wages accounted for the lowest share of income — 51 percent — since the government began keeping track in 1929.That all may be true. But its off point. The article indicates what percentage of Americans overall income comes from the government. But it says nothing about what percentage of individual Wisconsinites -- or Americans, for that matter -- receive government assistance.We told Welhouse we still wanted to know what Fitzgerald defined as government handouts. When he called back, he said Fitzgerald told him he had meant to say that one in six Wisconsin residents -- not one in two -- get government handouts.Welhouse didnt say what Fitzgerald considered as handouts, but he provided another USA Today article, from August 2010. Analyzing state data, the newspaper found that government anti-poverty programs such as welfare, Medicaid, food stamps and unemployment insurance served a record one in six Americans.The article makes no mention of Wisconsin, however.We contacted state agencies to see how many Wisconsinites receive government assistance from the four major programs cited in the second article that Welhouse provided. Heres what we found: Since Wisconsin has about 5.65 million people, according to the U.S. Census Bureau, that means roughly one in five state residents is on Medicaid alone.If you added the recipients in all four programs, the total would represent 2.16 million people, or more than one in three Wisconsinites. That would still be far short of the one in two that Fitzgerald claimed at the convention.But the true figure is lower than 2.16 million because some people receive assistance from more than one of the programs. Based on the available information, we could not determine an exact number – nor could Fitzgerald.We also contacted experts at four private organizations in Wisconsin that track government programs. None said they were aware of any study that attempted to determine what percentage of Wisconsin residents receives government assistance or a government handout.All of this is setting aside the question of what constitutes a handout, which is a subjective term.The article cited by Fitzgeralds aide to support the 1-in-2 claim included Social Security and Medicare, both of which workers pay into through payroll taxes. Many people would not consider those programs handouts.Heres the bottom line:Fitzgerald made a bold statement at the state GOP convention -- that one out of every two Wisconsin residents is on some kind of government handout. He was able to provide no evidence to back the claim, and even one of his aides essentially acknowledged it was wrong. The Senate leader later provided a different number, but the data he relied on is not specific to Wisconsin.",0,1,0.5,0,1,1,1,0.5,1,False

Final Rating: Half True  ",Obamacare will mean 2.1 million fewer jobs by 2021.,"Opponents of the federal health care law recently got what they believe supports their argument that Congress should pull the plug on the legislation. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office projected that the law will push many Americans from the workforce. The Georgia chapter of Americans for Prosperity, a longtime critic of the law, held a rally at the state Capitol calling for the repeal of the controversial law, citing the CBOs projections. The Affordable Care Act has been disastrous for Georgians, causing premiums around the state to shoot up dramatically and causing many Georgians to lose their previous insurance. All this, despite the presidents promise that if you like your plan, you can keep it, AFP Communications Director Joel Aaron Foster said. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office says Obamacare will mean 2.1 million fewer jobs by 2021. PolitiFact Georgia wondered whether the Georgia chapter was correct in its interpretation about the potential number of jobs lost as a result of the law. Our partners at PolitiFact in Washington had looked at a similar claim and found one major flaw. The National Republican Congressional Committee claimed in a television ad that Nonpartisan government analysts say Obamacare will cost our economy up to 2.5 million jobs. PolitiFact noted that the CBO report did not use the word jobs. CBOs updated estimate of the decrease in hours worked translates to a reduction in full-time-equivalent employment of about 2.0 million in 2017, rising to about 2.5 million in 2024, compared with what would have occurred in the absence of the ACA, the CBO report said. The CBO report suggested some people will choose to work fewer hours, others may quit their jobs in order to get health care subsidies they would not receive if they continued to work their regular schedule. Because some people will reduce the amount of hours they work rather than stopping work altogether, the number who will choose to leave employment because of the ACA in 2024 is likely to be substantially less than 2.5 million, the CBO report said. PolitiFact noted: An important distinction in the report is that labor force will reduce by the equivalent of 2.5 million full-time workers over the next decade. That doesnt mean 2.5 million people will leave their jobs. Some people will only cut back a few hours or leave a second part-time job while others may stop working entirely. PolitiFact rated the National Republican Congressional Committees claim Mostly False. We contacted Americans for Prosperity Georgia to see whether there was any additional context it has that may show it should earn a better rating on the Truth-O-Meter. The groups spokesman, Foster, said the chapter stands by its statement. He pointed to other news coverage that used the same terminology to describe the conclusion the CBO reached in its report. The CBO report said the health care law will cause Americans to cut their work hours, equating to 2 million fewer jobs in 2017. That number is predicted to eventually rise to the equivalent of 2.5 million jobs in 2024, Politico reported. We found other prominent news outlets used similar language in their initial coverage. Several million American workers will reduce their hours on the job or leave the workforce entirely because of incentives built into President Barack Obama's health care overhaul, the Congressional Budget Office said Tuesday, The Associated Press reported in an article that was published in The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. That would mean losses equal to 2.3 million full-time jobs by 2021, in large part because people would opt to keep their income low to stay eligible for federal health care subsidies or Medicaid, the agency said. It had estimated previously that the law would lead to 800,000 fewer jobs by that year. Some major news outlets described it differently, sticking closer to the CBOs description of its projection. The Washington Posts Fact Checker, though, explained there is a difference. [W]e should note that the figures (2 million, etc.) are shorthand for full-time equivalent workers — a combination of two conclusions: fewer people looking for work and some people choosing to work fewer hours. The CBO added those two things and produced a hard number, but it actually does not mean 2 million fewer workers, it reported. Our conclusion We debated long and hard about this one. Americans for Prosperity Georgia did capture the general theme of what the CBO tried to say about the impact of the health care law on employment. It will result in fewer people working fewer hours. But its terminology was not entirely accurate. The CBO report did not say the health care law would result in a reduction of 2.5 million jobs. It specifically said more than 2.5 million people are likely to reduce the amount of labor they choose to supply to some degree and added that many of them will not leave the labor force entirely. We believe that is an important distinction. This claim does contain some element of truth, but some of the details are incorrect.",0.5,0.5,1.0,0.5,0.0,0.5,0.5,1.0,0.5,Half True

Final Rating: Half True",A proposed bill in the Florida Legislature would authorize the public hoarding of cats by feral cat activists.,"Florida legislators are taking up the usual public policy topics this session: health care, taxes and campaign finance reform. Then theres the bill about feral cats. Dont call them feral cats, though. Bills in the Legislature are re-branding them with a more user-friendly name: community cats. Not so fast, say the bird lovers. The American Bird Conservancy is crying fowl, er foul. The bills would authorize the public hoarding of cats by feral cat activists, in the face of potential public health and property value impacts, as well as predicted high mortality for native animals, the groups said in a press release. The conservancy says passage of two bills (HB 1121/SB 1320) would make it easier for people to dump unwanted cats in areas where they roam aplenty. This is shocking, said Grant Sizemore, the conservancys Cats Indoors program manager. Hoarding of animals in homes is prohibited in most places, but we now have Florida encouraging it in public places such as city parks. There is no question that the health of local citizenry -- including children -- is being put at risk, property values in the hoarding areas will be impacted and local wildlife will continue to be devastated. PolitiFact Florida wanted to research whether this bill would allow cat hoarding. The cat bills The Community Cats legislation, sponsored by Rep. Holly Raschein, R-Key Largo, and Sen. Darren Soto, D-Orlando, attempts to rein in cat overpopulation. Several communities have established programs to spay and care for feral cats and release them, however there were concerns among some involved in such programs that the release of cats would constitute abandonment and violate state animal cruelty laws. The bill amends the states animal cruelty law to state that someone who spays or neuters a feral cat and then releases it is not abandoning the cat or breaking the law. The bill also states that counties and cities can still adopt their own ordinances to curtail the feral cat population. The bill defines a community cat as an outdoor, free-roaming cat that lacks visible owner identification and defines a community cat owner as someone who gives that cat food or water. Cat and wildlife activists have been battling each other about how to handle feral cats for years. A 2003 Tampa Bay Times article described a cat vs. rat battle at the Ocean Reef Club, an exclusive community of multimillion-dollar homes near a state park and wildlife refuge. Homeowners set up a program to take care of hundreds of stray cats, but meanwhile the populations of the Key Largo wood rat and cotton mouse, both endangered, dwindled. Wildlife experts pointed fingers at the cats. It's a very serious problem for Key Largo wood rats, University of Florida wildlife scientist Frank Mazzotti said at the time. Releasing a feral cat in a natural area is like releasing a serial murderer in a maternity ward. Central to the bill debate is whether programs that encourage the trap, neuter and release of feral cats reduce the feral cat population and the dangers to wildlife and humans. A study by scientists including from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service estimated that cats kill up to 3.7 billion birds a year, and found no connection between the programs (called TNR) and fewer bird deaths. Claims that TNR colonies are effective in reducing cat populations, and, therefore, wildlife mortality, are not supported by peer-reviewed scientific studies, it said. A 2003 Florida International University study concluded that TNR cat programs at two parks encouraged illegal dumping of cats and led to a population increase at one park, while the other remained stable. The Florida Department of Health, which remains neutral on the cat bill, stated in a 2012 rabies prevention report that managing feral cats is not tenable on public health grounds because of the persistent threat posed to communities from injury and disease. Bill supporters point to a study published in the journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association that concluded a TNR program at the University of Central Florida reduced the population. They also point to this research about the benefits of vaccinating cats. Would this lead to hoarding? So there is evidence that feral cats carry diseases and kill wildlife. But would this bill allow animal hoarding? A spokeswoman for the Humane Society, a group supporting the bill, said bill opponents are misusing the word hoarding. Animal hoarding is a serious mental illness, Humane society spokeswoman Katie Lisnik told PolitiFact. It is a severe case of neglect and abuse of animals. Thats different from programs that care for cats, she said. Hoarding -- generally speaking, not exclusively to animals -- will be listed by the American Psychiatric Associations Diagnostic and statistical Manual for the first time this year, said Smith College psychology professor Randy Frost who studies hoarding. We asked Frost if Floridas bill could lead to increased hoarding. I dont know that there is any way to tell, he said. I think it would be hard to hoard in a field or public place. ... I dont know of many cases of hoarding where hoarding occurred in public. Id have to think about that. Brevard County recently placed a moratorium on registration for cat colonies -- county officials know of several hundred colonies. Bob Brown, captain of enforcement for Brevard County animal services, said he doesnt think he would call these cat colonies hoarding. In a cat colony, they have no control if the cat comes or goes. Usually cat hoarders want to keep things confined within their control. An outdoor colony is different than the homes where there are cat urine stains all over the walls or cat feces dripping out of cabinets. Weve seen some real doozies, he said. Robert Johns, a spokesman with the bird conservancy, said the law removes penalties for people who abandon animals to public places.  Instead of having a hoard of cats in a house, which is illegal in many places, we would simply have dozens or hundreds of them outdoors in many places, essentially taking over public land to be used by feral cats, he said. Our ruling The American Bird Conservancy said a bill would authorize the public hoarding of cats by feral cat activists. The bill would authorize people to neuter and release feral cats. But its difficult to predict how these future cat colonies will be managed and controlled by local ordinances. Is it possible that someone could hoard feral cats outdoors? Sure. But animal hoarders typically want to be able to control their cats, so thats why they hoard inside their own homes. The research we reviewed about feral cats focused on numbers, health problems and threats to wildlife they pose -- not whether it constitutes hoarding. That could be because hoarding isnt the central debate about these feral cats, but it is a heated word that draws attention.",0.5,0.5,1,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,1,0.5,Half True

That it was impossible to balance a budget at the same time, with an $11 billion deficit. But three years later, we have three balanced budgets with lower taxes, Christie said. We did it.Here, well assess the governors claim that he balanced a budget with an $11 billion deficit.New Jerseys Constitution requires a balanced budget every year. Christie has met that obligation in every budget year.The major flaw with the governors claim is that the deficit he cites never went away. And Christie now dismisses that deficit calculation as the old way of budgeting.The $11 billion refers to a $10.7 billion structural deficit the states nonpartisan Office of Legislative Service projected for the fiscal 2011 budget year, when Christie proposed his first spending plan.A structural deficit measures how much money the state would need if current services and revenues remained the same and all spending obligations required by statute were fully funded.But the state does not have to meet all of its obligations since the budget supersedes statute.So although a state statute may require certain levels of spending on different programs, the governor can sign a budget that does otherwise.And thats largely what Christie did in his first budget.The governor skipped a $3.1 billion pension payment. He didnt fully fund the school aid formula. He didnt fully fund the states property tax rebate program.And the next budget year, the state still had a projected structural deficit.For the fiscal 2012 budget year, OLS projected a structural deficit of about $10.5 billion, nearly the same size as the previous fiscal year.But Christie then dismissed that calculation, calling it the old way of budgeting.In a budget speech last year, Christie said the projected deficit assumes no one is actually managing the budget or setting priorities. That is yesterdays New Jersey.Now, Christie said, the baseline is zero for budgeting.Our rulingChristie said naysayers said it was impossible to balance a budget at the same time, with an $11 billion deficit and we did it.The state Constitution requires a balanced budget every year and Christie met that obligation.The deficit figure Christie cites refers to a $10.7 billion projected structural deficit, a calculation Christie uses to his advantage in his first budget year but has since dismissed as the old way of budgeting.Thats important context Christies statement lacks.

Final Rating: Half True",Were 48th in K-12 funding and 50th in higher education.,"As he faces re-election next year, Republican Gov. Rick Scott says he wants to put money back in taxpayers pockets. He touts a property tax cut he got in 2011 (in reality, a smidgen), a pay hike for teachers in 2013 and now his proposal to cut $500 million in taxes or fees. Scott hasnt released specifics on his next tax cuts, but his overall message is clear: He wants voters to see him as the guy in their corner saving them money. Former Democratic state Sen. Nan Rich who is running against Scott, calls his idea a re-election gimmick in light of Floridas pressing needs -- including education. We need to be taking a long hard look at funding the critical needs of the state, she said Sept. 11. Were 48th in K-12 funding and 50th in higher education. Rich said more funding for education would be a better way to help the middle class. Florida has often gotten a bad rap for education spending -- but just how bottom of the barrel are we? PolitiFact Florida examined the states K-12 education funding ranking in 2010, but we wanted to see if the numbers had changed and if Rich had done her homework. K-12 funding There are lots of different ways to compare funding for K-12 or higher education. How Florida ranks depends on many factors such as whether the cost-of-living in various states is taken into account. Some analyses focus on state money while others also factor in local dollars. Not surprisingly, depending on the methodology, we found different numbers for Floridas ranking. But most were in the bottom of the pack. Rich directed us to the U.S. Census Bureauwhich shows Florida ranked 42nd in per-pupil funding at $10,031, taking into account federal, state and local sources, or 48th for state funding alone at $3,440 in 2011. Rich had cited that 48th figure. We found many other entities that provide state comparisons on education funding in a variety of ways including the National Education Association, Education Week and the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) which is part of the U.S. Department of Education. NCES, for example, shows that Florida spent $9,030 per pupil in 2011, ahead of 13 other states. (This chart combines funding so its not a measurement of only state spending.) Why the different ranking between the NCES report and the census report that Rich referenced? NCES includes charter schools, while the census generally doesnt, said Mark Dixon, project manager for the annual survey of school system finances for the census. Higher education funding Rich didnt direct us to a source of data for her claim about Florida ranking 50th in higher education. But much like K-12 funding comparisons, we found that different methodologies produced different rankings for Florida. The NEA ranked Florida 50th on per capita state and local government expenditures for higher education for the 2009-10 school year. The amount spent per capita was $485 -- just one buck lower than Nevada and ahead of the District of Columbia. We found more recent data through Grapevine, a longstanding annual report by Illinois State University. About half the states fund higher education in part through local funds, but the Grapevine report only shows state money. That report doesnt provide rankings but compares the states per capita, which refers to the states overall population. That analysis shows Florida at $172.98 per capita. By our count, that placed Florida ahead of eight states in 2013. I try to avoid rankings, said Jim Palmer, a professor and editor of Grapevine. Youve got 50 different state systems ... you have to wonder what the rankings really mean. If one state ranks lower than another does that mean the higher education system is not as good? I cant make that judgment. We were surprised to find Florida gave more money per capita than Massachusetts and asked Palmer to elaborate. The history of education in Massachusetts is not as reliant on the public sector as it has been in Florida. The private sector looms large in Massachusetts going back to Harvard. ... Florida devoted itself to developing a strong community college system -- stronger than New England. Palmer directed us to the State Higher Education Executive Officers, a group that publishes a report using Grapevine'sstate data along with other sources of funds, including local dollars and stimulus money. It also takes into account factors such as cost-of-living. That report showed Florida at $5,130 -- ahead of about 20 states. Our ruling Rich said, Were 48th in K-12 funding and 50th in higher education. There are lots of different valid ways to measure education funding. One way is to compare how much money a state provides for education per pupil,and by that measure Florida ranked 48th according to the Census. Thats a valid way to look at the numbers because it was in the context of Rich criticizing the governor who signs the state budget. However, its one of several ways to measure school spending. For higher education spending, the National Education Association ranked Florida 50th for state and local expenditures in 2009-10. But other more recent analysis we reviewed showed Florida higher than 50th. One measure showed Florida ahead of about 20 states.",0.5,0.2,1.0,0.7,0.1,0.3,0.5,0.5,0.4,Half True

Final Rating: Half True  ",Alex Sink was the first official who said that BP should pay $25 million for an ad campaign to promote Florida tourism.,"Since the April 20, 2010, Deepwater Horizon oil rig explosion, several Florida politicians have been talking tough and trying to take credit for demanding a stronger response on the oil spill. And now Democratic political consultant and Louisiana resident James Carville says CFO Alex Sink, a Democratic candidate for Florida governor, should get props for being first to ask BP for tourism ad bucks.Here's what Carville wrote in a June 8 fundraising letter for Sink's campaign, which he supports:Alex is the one who called on BP's CEO to come to Florida to explain how he expects to protect Florida's economy and environment. She was also the first official who said that BP should pay $25 million for an ad campaign to promote Florida tourism.We wondered if Sink really was the first official to say BP should fund a campaign to promote Florida. How quickly politicians make such a request is relevant because the spill started April 20 and the tourism season in part of the state gets underway Memorial Day weekend.For starters, we need to set the parameters for official. Appointed officials? Anyone in elected office? Any statewide official? That's unclear from Carville's letter, and Carville's office referred us to the Sink campaign. Spokesman Kyra Jennings told us in an e-mail that the reference was to the first elected official in the state (which I believe she was, at least high profile or statewide elected official). For Sink's part, Jennings sent us a link to a Bay News 9 TV story about a May 8 press conference Sink had in St. Petersburg after she met with a BP representative. That story stated, According to Sink, she has asked BP to fund a global media campaign to explain to tourists that the state is open for business, to consider fronting or advancing money on behalf of small businesses and coastal communities for interruption claims. On May 10, Sink wrote a letter to BP asking that it fully fund the cost of a worldwide advertising campaign to put the brakes on the economic damage to our state's number-one industry. Neither the TV news story posted on the website nor Sink's letter included a specific dollar request from BP. Gov. Charlie Crist announced on May 25 that $25 million had been wired to the state.Jennings also pointed to a St. Petersburg Times/Miami Herald story on May 26 about a press conference Crist held about the tourism ad money. The article stated: It was Sink on May 10 who first demanded that the oil giant BP pay for a TV ad blitz aimed at shoring up Florida tourism.''So Sink pushed BP for the tourism ad money on May 10, and even raised the idea on May 8. What about other statewide elected officials?Jennings sent us a link to an Associated Press article about Gov. Crist asking BP to provide about $35 million for tourism ads on May 12. Crist spokesman Sterling Ivey confirms for PolitiFact Florida that Crist first sought tourism ad dollars from BP on that date. As for the rest of the state cabinet, spokesmen for Attorney General Bill McCollum and Agriculture Commissioner Charles Bronson said neither sought tourism ad dollars from BP.The only other statewide elected officials in Florida are our two senators. Sen. Bill Nelson did not seek tourism ad dollars, according to his spokesperson. Sen. George LeMieux's spokesman said he didn't think LeMieux asked for tourism ad money, but never gave a definitive answer. We searched news articles and press releases and could find no such proposal from LeMieux. So Sink was the first statewide elected official to demand tourism ad money from BP. But Carville's letter said she was the first official and we think a reasonable person would not limit the statement to statewide officials.Next we contacted Visit Florida, the state's tourism office, which received money to pay for a campaign promoting Florida. CEO Chris Thompson told us that he spoke on the phone with state Rep. Marti Coley, R-Marianna, while she attended a May 4 town hall in Fort Walton Beach.Rep. Coley was the one that seemed to be taking the lead, Thompson said. 'She said, 'If BP was willing to make some funding available for tourism promotion could you put it to good use?' And I said, 'Yes ma'am.' ''Coley helped connect Visit Florida with BP and two days later, on May 6, Visit Florida had a proposal ready for $19.45 million. That proposal later grew to $34.75 million, Thompson said, because the Governor's Office wanted a more significant initial response. Thompson said that he did not discuss the tourism ad proposal directly with Crist but did discuss it with Chris Hart, the director of the Governor's Office of Tourism, Trade and Economic Development.Even though I didn't have a conversation with Gov. Crist, his office was in on the conversations, Thompson said. The first politician that got me involved was Marti Coley.We interviewed Coley about the May 4 town hall meeting.One thing we kept hearing from everyone was they were being inudated with cancellations, she said, referring to hotels and charter boats. She said she asked a BP representative attending the town hall meeting if BP would help advertise through Visit Florida and other organizations that the beaches were open.I called our state agency, which does our advertising, and said, 'Put a proposal together,'  Coley said.We also talked to Hope Lanier, the BP spokesperson at that meeting. Lanier said Coley stood up in the meeting and volunteered to be a point person to work with BP and VISIT FLORIDA toward trying to pull together a workable solution for tourism funding. PolitiFact Florida could not find news coverage of the town hall meeting in a Nexis search and when the state did get the $25 million, Coley didn't appear to take credit for it in a press release. But she did in a June 9 article in the Jackson County Floridan. (Coley is running for re-election in Florida House District 7.) The article stated: In response to the disaster, Coley mentioned to attendees that she has been working with Visit Florida -- Florida's main tourism advocate -- and BP officials to get the initial $25 million contribution from the oil company to go towards damage control. Coley says she worked hard to ensure BP officials stepped up to their financial responsibility of lessening the impact on tourism with an advertising campaign. She is now pushing for an additional contribution for further efforts, but all is up to Gov. Charlie Crist at this time.Officials at Visit Florida also recalled state Sen. Don Gaetz, R-Niceville, speaking up about the need for tourism ads early. Gaetz's chief legislative aide, Chris Clark, said Gaetz spoke with a BP representative on May 2 to ask if they would be willing to help with advertising but did not ask for a specific dollar amount.Sink's campaign did not provide any documentation that she specifically asked for $25 million, either, but we think the more interesting point is whether she was the first official to say BP should give the state money for a tourism ad campaign.We find evidence that other state officials spoke up earlier than Sink, though she was the first statewide elected official to raise the issue. Carville's letter is unspecific on this point, so we have to consider what a reasonable person would think. And by the accounts of Visit Florida, we find others spoke up sooner.

Final Rating: Mostly False  ","The Obama administration ... would impose on every Catholic institution, every Jewish institution, every Protestant institution the Obamacare standard of what you have to buy as insurance.","Newt Gingrich, on the campaign trail before the Florida GOP primary, called out the Barack Obama administration for engaging in a war against religion.Federal officials' interpretation of the 2010 health care law violates religious freedom, he said.Their decision last week that they would impose on every Catholic institution, every Jewish institution, every Protestant institution the Obamacare standard of what you have to buy as insurance is a direct violation of freedom of religion, an example of the dictatorial attitude of this administration,he told voters in Jacksonville, Fla., on Jan. 30, 2012.What decision was he talking about? One about birth control. His campaign pointed us to criticism from theU.S. Conference of Catholic Bishopsof a Jan. 20 decision that ordered almost every employer and insurer in the country to provide sterilization and contraceptives, including some abortion-inducing drugs, in their health plans, according to the group.The bishops said almost every employer and insurer.We wondered, was Gingrich right that the Obama administration would impose on every Catholic institution, every Jewish institution, every Protestant institution the Obamacare standard of what you have to buy as insurance?'The Obamacare standard'The rule Gingrich was talking about, announced by Health and Human Services Department Secretary Kathleen Sebelius, addressed which preventive services must be covered by insurers without a co-pay, co-insurance or a deductible paid by the recipient of medical care.We should mention: There's not a clear Obamacare standard of what you have to buy as insurance. The law provides for co-pay-free preventive care, which is what Sebelius clarified Jan. 20. And for individual and small-group plans, the law requires that policies cover essential health benefits. They must include services in 10 categories, but the details have been left to the states.The idea of co-pay-free preventive care stems from studies that show that even moderate co-payskept women from getting care, such as mammograms or pap smears, according to HHS. The nongovernmentalInstitute of Medicinerecommended that preventive services include all FDA-approved forms of contraception. So that's what HHS decided to include in its final rule about preventive services.Most health insurance plans will have to cover them without a co-pay, co-insurance or a deductible. For most new and renewed health plans, that requirement kicks in Aug. 1, 2012. Religious exemptionsNotice we said that most health insurance plans will have to offer co-pay-free preventive care. The U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops said almost every employer and insurer.Gingrich said, every Catholic institution, every Jewish institution, every Protestant institution.But the rule provides an exemption for certain non-profit religious employersthat meet a four-part test-- essentially churches and synagogues, but also some primary and secondary religious schools.It's that definition of religious employer that has prompted theU.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, with the support of groups such as theUnion of Orthodox Jewish Congregations of America, to fight the rule. That's because it wouldn't cover religious organizations that don't primarily employ or serve people of the same religion — ruling out many universities, hospitals and charitable groups.That would require, say, a Catholic hospital to offer insurance coverage to its employees that included FDA-approved contraceptive drugs — which includes some drugs that Catholics consider abortion-inducing. Plan B and Ella prevent fertilization of an egg, prompting the FDA to categorize them as contraceptives rather than abortion-inducing drugs, but Catholics argue that Ellacan be used like the abortifacient RU-486, which isn't considered a contraceptive by the FDA.The government is giving such nonprofit religious groupsan extra yearto implement the preventive care requirements. But it won't exempt them.The decision already faceslegal challengesfrom Belmont Abbey College and Colorado Christian University.Still, if you consider a Catholic church to be a Catholic institution, or a synagogue to be a Jewish institution, Gingrich isn't correct that the recent federal rule on contraceptives applies. Those nonprofit religious employers could choose whether or not they covered contraceptive services.Our ruling Gingrich said that the Obama administration ... would impose on every Catholic institution, every Jewish institution, every Protestant institution the Obamacare standard of what you have to buy as insurance.He makes a broad statement in reference to a rule dealing specifically with co-pays for preventive care -- making it sound as though there's a blanket Obamacare standard for all insurance policies. The reality allows for states to set benchmarks for private individual and small-group plans.Meanwhile, he ignores an exemption in the federal rule for nonprofit religious employers such as churches and synagogues. That exemption has been condemned by Catholic bishops as too narrow and has been challenged in court. But it makes Gingrich's statement that the rule would impose on every ... institution inaccurate and misleading. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/dd0ecf5b-876e-4cfe-ac88-5c90949e8e9f",0.3,0.7,1.0,0.4,0.2,0.6,0.5,1.0,0.5,Mostly False

Final Rating: Half True  ","It's entirely possible that the Democratic nominee, [Hillary Clinton], earned more money giving a single speech on Wall Street than I made the six years that I was there back in the 1980s In fact, its quite likely.","U.S. Senator Pat Toomey, R-Pa., appeared on the Chris Stigall Show two weeks ago, and he wasnt afraid to poke fun at his Wall Street past. When Stigall mentioned that Hillary Clinton has been paid lucratively for giving speeches to Wall Street banks, Toomey responded by making a comparison between Clinton and himself. It's entirely possible, said Toomey that the democratic nominee, [Hillary Clinton], earned more money giving a single speech on Wall Street than I made the six years that I was there back in the 1980s. In fact, he went on, its quite likely. We reached out to the Toomey campaign multiple times seeking information about how much he earned during his six years on Wall Street, but they never got back at us. The hefty salaries of modern-day Wall Street traders are viewed by many with disgust, but 30 years ago, Wall Street was a very different place. Is it possible Pat Toomey earned less on Wall Street than Clinton did for a single speech there? We decided to find out. How much has Hillary made for her speeches? Its no secret Clinton has made a lot money from giving speeches, but most of the speeches that shes given were not to Wall Street banks. According to her 2014 tax return, 14 of the 41 speeches Clinton gave in 2013 were to Wall Street banks, and she was paid the same amount, $225,000, for most of them. But on Oct. 7, 2014, her Public Financial Disclosure Report report states that she gave a speech to Deutsche Bank and earned $260,000 for it. CNN compiled a list of all the amounts that the Clintons have earned for speaking to big banks from February 2001 to May 2015, and it reaffirms that amount for her Deutsche Bank speech. But Toomeys claim specifically refers to Wall Street. If Clinton made $260,000 in her most profitable speech to a Wall Street firm, then Toomey would have had to have made an average of about $43,000 during his six years on Wall Street for his claim to be true. The Rise of the Stock Market and the Traders in it Toomey worked on Wall Street from 1984 to 1990 for Chemical Bank and Morgan Grenfell. In a 1999 interview with Derivatives Strategy magazine, Toomey discussed the work he did at Morgan Grenfell, where he said he and a few others were recruited to start a serious derivatives operation. We were dealing in various currencies, said Toomey, all kinds of interest rate and currency-related derivatives—options, swaps, forwards and so on. A report by the Los Angeles Times confirmed Toomey traded derivatives around interest rates and currencies. Again, when we asked the Toomey campaign if they could provide us with approximate salary figures for Toomey or Wall Street derivatives traders in the 1980s, we didnt receive a response. Luckily, there are some figures we can use as approximations. The derivatives market exploded during Toomeys time on Wall Street. In fact, the size of the global derivatives industry more than quintupled from 1986 to 1991. According to a report by Mother Jones, the notional value of derivatives contracts went from $865 billion to nearly $4.5 trillion. Salaries for Wall Street employees were not nearly as lucrative as they are today, but employees there were still among the highest-paid in the nation. A New York Times article from 1987 put the average salary on Wall Street that year at $65,000, before bonuses (which was more than three times the average New Yorkers salary of $19,000). That number included all Wall Street employees, from the highest-ranking positions to new analysts. According to the Derivatives magazine article, Toomeys position at Chemical Bank was associate, a position generally considered to be above entry level and often given to people with MBAs.  Philip Bond, a professor of finance and business economics at the University of Washington, said a salary of $43,000 was within the realm of possibility. I guess an average of $43,000 a year strikes me as being on the low side, said Bond, But I don't think it is impossible. After talking to colleagues here, I believe the starting salary for an undergraduate on Wall Street would have been considerably less than $43,000 in 1985. However even in the 1980s, Wall Street traders generally earned significant bonuses along with their annual salaries. Former bonds salesman Michael Lewis wrote about how bonuses were determined in his bestselling book Liars Poker. A salesman's year-end bonus was determined by traders, writes Lewis,  A trader's bonus was determined by the profits on his trading books. A salesman had no purchase on a trader, while a trader had complete control over a salesman. Toomey doesnt appear to have been a bad trader. Morgan Grenfell hired him and other associates to start its derivatives operation in 1986, according to the Derivatives Strategy magazine article.  If Toomey made significant profits as a derivatives trader, then he would likely have made a solid bonus along with his salary. Lewis, as he notes in Liars Poker, made a bonus of $45,000 in his first year as a bonds salesman, matching his $45,000 salary that year. Lewis had a M.A. in economics when he entered Wall Street, while Toomey only had a B.A. in government. It is possible Toomey made an annual compensation of less than $43,000 per year, but that seems unlikely when we take a bonus into account. And even if he did make an average of $43,000 a year during his time on Wall Street, inflation would put his total haul at well above $260,000. We asked two professors to help us adjust a 1985 salary of $43,000 for wage inflation. Ehud Ronn, a professor of finance at the University of Texas at Austin, also noted the figure of $43,000 a year seemed somewhat low. Ronnused an index that reporteda historical time series of compensation in the financial sector. According to the index, a salary of $43,200 in March 1985 would be equivalent to $124,200 in 2016. If Toomey made an average of $124,200 over six years, he would have made $745,200 in 2016 dollars according to this estimate. Bond, the University of Washington professor of finance, used GDP per capita to adjust for wage inflation. Nominal GDP per capita is about 4 times as high today is in the mid-1980s said Bond, So if financial compensation had grown at the same speed as nominal GDP per capita, $43K in 1985 would equate to roughly $170K today. If Toomey made an average of $170,000 over six years, he would have made $1,020,000 in 2016 dollars according to this estimate. Based on these back-of-envelope calculations, I suspect Toomey's statement is true, or at least close to true, started Bond, but if he adjusted for inflation, his claim is most likely not true. Lynn Stout, a professor of corporate law at Cornell University and an internationally recognized expert in the field of financial derivatives, seemed to believe that a yearly figure of $43,000 would have been very low even in the 1980s. If he did receive only $43,000 a year for six years of trading, said Stout, he must have been one of the worst performing and worst paid derivatives traders on Wall Street at the time. Our ruling Pat Toomey said that it was possible and even likely that Hillary Clinton earned more money giving a single speech to a Wall Street bank than he did in his six years there. Clinton earned $260,000 in her most profitable speech to a Wall Street bank, so Toomey would have had to have earned an average of about $43,000 per year on Wall Street. Its possible the entry-level salary for a trader was less than $43,000 in the 1980s, but Toomey was a trader at the forefront of the derivatives operation at Morgan Grenfell. So its likely he earned a significant bonus, which would put his earnings over that threshold. It gets less likely if we adjust Toomeys non-bonus-inflated potential salary for inflation. An annual salary of about $43,000 in 1985 would make significantly more than $260,000 over six years in 2016 dollars. And Toomey didnt just say it was possible he made less in six years on Wall Street than Clinton did in one speech. He said it was likely. Based on average salaries and bonuses from this era of Wall Street and input from experts, it does not seem likely. It gets less likely if we adjust Toomeys non-bonus-inflated potential salary for inflation. An annual salary of about $43,000 in 1985 would make significantly more than $260,000 over six years in 2016 dollars.",0.5,0.5,1,0.5,0,0,0.5,0.5,0.5,Half True

Final Rating: Mostly False","Van Jones is an avowed, self-avowed radical revolutionary communist.","Radio and TV political commentator Glenn Beck has spent weeks detailing what he says is a web of Obama administration officials with socialist or communist ties. And Exhibit A in the Beck argument has been Van Jones, Obama's so-called green jobs czar (his actual title was special adviser for green jobs at the Council on Environmental Quality). Conservative commentators and bloggers criticized Jones because of his past remarks and his involvement with controversial groups. His resignation was announced shortly after midnight on Sept. 6, 2009. Beck has repeatedly claimed Jones is a communist. For purposes of a fact-check statement, we selected a Sept. 1, 2009, remark Beck made on his radio program that Jones is an avowed, self-avowed radical revolutionary communist. There's little question that Jones  was  an avowed communist. In a Nov. 2, 2005, profile of Jones in the  East Bay Express  , an alternative weekly in Berkeley, Calif., Jones said his life hit a turning point in the spring of 1992 when he was swept up in mass arrests while protesting the acquittal of police officers accused of beating Rodney King. Although the charges against Jones were dropped, Jones said that while in jail, I met all these young radical people of color — I mean really radical, communists and anarchists. And it was, like, 'This is what I need to be a part of.' I spent the next 10 years of my life working with a lot of those people I met in jail, trying to be a revolutionary. In the months that followed, the  Express  article said, he let go of any lingering thoughts that he might fit in with the status quo. 'I was a rowdy nationalist on April 28th, and then the verdicts came down on April 29th,' he said. 'By August, I was a communist.' In 1994, the story states, Jones formed a socialist collective called Standing Together to Organize a Revolutionary Movement, or STORM. According to a history of STORM written in the spring of 2004, the group held structured political education training at every meeting to help members develop an understanding of the basics of Marxist politics. They trained members on capitalism and wage exploitation, the state and revolution, imperialism and the revolutionary party. So Jones was a self-avowed communist. But is he still? The answer lies in the very same article. Even before the group disbanded in 2002, the  Express  article says, Jones began transforming his politics and work... According to the article, He took an objective look at the movement's effectiveness and decided that the changes he was seeking were actually getting farther away. Not only did the left need to be more unified, he decided, it might also benefit from a fundamental shift in tactics. 'I realized that there are a lot of people who are capitalists — shudder, shudder — who are really committed to fairly significant change in the economy, and were having bigger impacts than me and a lot of my friends with our protest signs,' he said. In recent years, Jones established himself as a leading, charismatic cheerleader for transitioning the American economy to green jobs. We weren't able to find any recent interviews where Jones directly addresses the question of where he stands on communism. When he resigned this week, Jones said he was the victim of a vicious smear campaign by conservatives and decided to resign so as not to be a distraction. I cannot in good conscience ask my colleagues to expend precious time and energy defending or explaining my past, he said in a released statement. But check out these two statements and see if this sounds like a communist. This, from his book,  The Green Collar Economy  , released in October 2008: There will surely be an important role for nonprofit voluntary, cooperative, and community-based solutions, Jones writes on page 86. But the reality is that we are entering an era during which our very survival will demand invention and innovation on a scale never before seen in the history of human civilization. Only the business community has the requisite skills, experience, and capital to meet that need. On that score, neither the government nor the nonprofit and voluntary sectors can compete, not even remotely. So in the end, our success and survival as a species are largely and directly tied to the new eco-entrepreneurs — and the success and survival of their enterprises. Since almost all of the needed eco-technologies are likely to come from the private sector, civic leaders and voters should do all that can be done to help green business leaders succeed. That means, in large part, electing leaders who will pass bills to aid them. We cannot realistically proceed without a strong alliance between the best of the business world — and everyone else. Or how about this, from an address before the Center for American Progress on Nov. 19, 2008 (well before Jones was brought into the Obama administration): Everything that is good for the environment, everything that's needed to beat global warming, is a job, Jones said. Solar panels don't manufacture themselves. Wind turbines don't manufacture themselves. Homes don't weatherize themselves. Every single thing that we need to beat global warming will also beat the recession. And the challenge is, how do we get the government to be a smart, and limited, catalyst in getting the private sector to take on this challenge? That doesn't sound Marxist to us. Beck would have been on solid ground if he said Jones  used to be  a communist. Jones has been up front about that. But Beck has repeatedly said Jones  is  a communist. Present tense. Although we could not find a comment in which Jones explicitly said why he is no longer one, we found ample evidence that he now believes capitalism is the best force for the social change he is seeking. So there's truth to Beck's claim in that Jones  was  a communist, but it's apparent he isn't any longer, as Beck suggests. So we find the claim Barely True.  Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False. ",0.5,0.7,0.9,0.6,0.4,0.6,0.5,0.8,0.5,Mostly False

Final Rating: Mostly False",The new tax law iskicking the American economy into high gear with $5.5 trillion in tax cuts.,"In its 1600 Daily email to supporters and members of the public, the White House touted the tax bill that President Donald Trump signed in late December as a highlight of 2017. The email said that the new law would be kicking the American economy into high gear with $5.5 trillion in tax cuts, 1.7 million new jobs, and more than 60 record highs for the Dow Jones index. Heres a screenshot: That $5.5 trillion figure caught the eye of a reader, who wrote PolitiFact to note that the figure most frequently applied to the bill in news accounts is $1.5 trillion. So whats going on? When we checked into it, we found that $5.5 trillion is a misleading number because it only focuses on one side of the ledger. The law does include roughly $5.5 trillion in tax cuts over the next 10 years, which is the standard time frame for studying bills of this sort. (This just measures the cuts themselves without taking into account any possible economic growth spurred by the cuts.) However, the law also includes roughly $4 trillion in tax increases. When you add the two numbers together, the net change is roughly $1.5 trillion. So the White House is enjoying its dessert (the tax cuts) while ignoring the vegetables (the tax hikes). That provides a skewed version of the bills, tax policy experts say. Patrick Newton, a spokesman for the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, said that the $5.5 trillion figure is misleading if its the only one cited. If one figure was going to be cited, it should be the net cost of the bill — $1.5 trillion. He noted, however, that the White House did use a more accurate formulation in a more detailed web page dated Dec. 21, 2017, that explains the bills provisions. On that web page, the White House wrote that the bill provides $5.5 trillion in tax cuts but that it will also raise $4 trillion in revenue to help offset tax cuts. Our ruling Trump said the recently enacted tax law includes $5.5 trillion in tax cuts. Putting it that way ignores that the bill also includes $4 trillion in tax increases, for a net of $1.5 trillion in tax cuts.",0.5,0.7,1.0,0.4,0.3,0.6,0.5,1.0,0.6,Mostly False

Final Rating: Half True",Says he is the reason we do not pay a toll every time we pass over the bridge at MoPac and William Cannon.,"For many South Austinites in 2004, a proposal to charge a toll on MoPac Boulevard (Loop 1) at William Cannon Drive was a bridge too far.Gerald Daugherty, then commissioner for Travis Countys Precinct 3, heard from quite a lot of those folks. And in his bid to retake that job Nov. 6, 2012, he has said he served them well: Daugherty is the reason we do not pay a toll every time we pass over the bridge at MoPac and William Cannon, according to a campaign flier.That bridge was at the center of debate over the regions 2004 toll road plan -- a debate so heated it launched an effort to recall two Austin City Council members and the mayor.Road wrangling in Precinct 3 hasnt calmed down much since then; the fight over Texas 45 Southwest underpinned a fact-check we recently wrote about Daughertys Democratic opponent, incumbent Karen Huber.In fact, Daugherty bumper stickers in his 2012 race read, Want SH 45 SW built? Vote for Gerald Daugherty.So we wondered: Was he the reason the toll at William Cannon didnt happen?Its a bold claim, Daugherty said when we called him. We probably shouldnt have used that definitive a position versus saying, I was one of the people that led the charge against  the toll, he said.Campaign manager Kathy Pillmore told us by email that the flier was mailed out May 10, 2012, in advance of the May 29 primary vote. Daugherty bested two fellow Republicans in the primary and now faces Huber, who defeated him for the seat in 2008, and Libertarian nominee Pat Dixon.Pillmore said the campaign stands by the statement. Daughertys website features a slightly different version: William Cannon Toll Bridge - working with State Representative Terry Keel we were instrumental in stopping TxDOT from tolling the overpass at Loop 1 South and William Cannon Road.The Texas Department of Transportation was in a fix at the time, Daugherty said, lacking sufficient money to build new roads while maintaining existing roads. Tollways were one option.A Dec. 27, 2004, Austin American-Statesman transportation column recapped the opening salvos of The Great Turnpike War of 2004: (I)n April, the Central Texas Regional Mobility Authority and Bob Daigh, the Austin district engineer for the Texas Department of Transportation, unveiled a toll road plan of eye-popping scope: ... a $1.8 billion, seven-road plan.  The reaction locally was subdued at first, and even a well-attended public hearing in May was relatively low-key. But then state Rep. Terry Keel of Austin and Travis County Commissioner Gerald Daugherty, Republicans with a history of supporting roads, unexpectedly came out against parts of the plan, especially levying tolls on a short stretch of MoPac Boulevard (Loop 1) at William Cannon Drive. Double taxation, they called it, because the project, already under construction, was being built with (state) gasoline tax dollars.  (Circle C neighborhood resident Sal) Costello began a recall petition campaign against Austin Mayor Will Wynn and two other council members who voted for the plan  (B)ehind the scenes, talks continued about how to change the plan and quell the uproar.  A Sept. 20, 2004, Statesman news story referring to the uproar said, The spark that lighted that still out-of-control blaze was the state's plan to charge people a half-buck to stay on MoPac and avoid the light at William Cannon Drive.Daugherty said, according to a Statesman news story from May 4, 2004, and transportation column from May 31, 2004, that he got 600 phone calls in three days objecting to the toll plan and more than 200 messages in the first week and a half after it was announced.What got Austin drivers hopping mad was the fact that a toll was going to be charged on a road that had already been paid for.Drawing on state gas tax revenues, work had started on the 1.45-mile overpass earlier in 2004. Until MoPac traffic could sail above William Cannon, drivers were funneled through the stoplights there.Daugherty recalled: They were just about ready to lay the columns across those pillars that had been there forever, and we all knew that, Wow, were just about to get this road, this bridge put across. And man, wont that be great, because everyones not going to have to get off.The plan unveiled April 24, 2004, included a toll there precisely because the overpass was incomplete.Daigh, the TxDOT engineer who drafted the plan with the Central Texas Regional Mobility Authority, told us in a recent telephone interview that few Austin roads were eligible for tolls because tolls could not be charged on an existing road or a road that had no alternative route. The 2004 plan, he said, included every option in the area.When the plan was announced, Daugherty recalled, You talk about people coming unhinged. He said he heard opposition from both residents and businesspeople in his precinct, which covers southwestern Travis County and contains the overpass site.A Nov. 28, 2004, Statesman transportation column said Keel and Daugherty had held a press conference in May of that year condemning the toll road plan. The column said residents opposition and elected officials work got the William Cannon toll dropped.Daugherty told us, I think I probably was the lead person on it. But Terry and I did the press conference together and said, OK, well, hey, were just not going to be supportive of this.  He said he believes his opposition was influential in part because I was so well-known for being supportive of roadways.But yes, he said, it was not a one-man show: I guess if someone wants to say technically, you werent the only guy... Anybody that knew anything about it knew that I was the energy behind fighting this like the dickens.The toll plan was added to the regions long-range transportation plan by a July 12, 2004, vote of the Capital Area Metropolitan Planning Organization board.At that meeting, we learned via email from CAMPO assistant director Bubba Needham, Daugherty moved to delete the toll from the MoPac overpass after he and other members of the board (which is composed mostly of local elected officials) spoke against the plan. His motion failed 17-6, according to the minutes. Voting with him to delete the toll were Keel and fellow Republican state Reps. Todd Baxter and Jack Stick; Democratic state Rep. Elliott Naishtat; and Austin City Council Member Daryl Slusher.Afterward, according to the minutes, the board voted 16-7 to add the toll proposals to the long-range plan; the seven opposed were those who voted for Daughertys motion plus Democratic state Rep. Eddie Rodriguez.Six months later, the board reversed course by adopting a resolution to remove the overpass from toll consideration. According to the minutes of the boards Jan. 24, 2005, meeting, board chair Gonzalo Barrientos told the board that although that toll had been seen as an essential source of money to improve MoPac, he, Mayor Will Wynn and Precinct 2 commissioner Karen Sonleitner had gotten financial backing from the Texas Transportation Commission to go ahead with the MoPac work without those toll revenues.Barrientos said, according to the minutes, that an engineering concern with the overpass had come up. Asked to explain that issue, Daigh said that the mobility authority had decided drivers would end up in a traffic jam.According to the minutes, Barrientos moved to de-toll the overpass, citing the traffic jam concern and noting the toll revenue was no longer an issue. The motion passed.We called Barrientos to get his take on who was most responsible for getting the overpass toll dropped. No single person makes such a decision happen, he told us, but Daugherty was key.The commissioners consistent opposition to the overpass toll, speaking up every time the issue came up, surely helped, he said.Barrientos characterized the discussion that he, Wynn and Sonleitner had with the Transportation Commission as the type of negotiations needed to reach any agreement and said there might have been others helping to reach the agreement.I think probably everybody gets credit, he said, but Daugherty was in the forefront.Daigh, who is now senior director of infrastructure for Williamson County, told us he believes there would be a toll on that road if not for Daugherty. He was the leader of the effort not to have MoPac tolled, Daigh said.Our rulingDaugherty told us he overstated in claiming that he is the reason we do not pay a toll every time we pass over the bridge at MoPac and William Cannon.He was an early and prominent opponent. But his claim leaves out the many residents and public officials who spoke, lobbied and voted against the overpass toll and worked to find an alternative. No one person was the reason theres no toll at the bridge.",0.5,0.6,0.8,0.4,0.3,0.5,0.6,0.7,0.5,Half True

Final Rating: Half True  ","John McCain said he wouldn't even sit down with the government of Spain, a NATO ally that has troops in Afghanistan with us now.","During the vice presidential debate in St. Louis,Joe Biden argued for a vigorous diplomacyand attacked John McCain's approach to foreign policy. John McCain said as recently as a couple of weeks ago he wouldn't even sit down with the government of Spain, a NATO ally that has troops in Afghanistan with us now. I find that incredible, Biden said. Biden was referring to an interview McCain gave with Radio Caracol in Miami on Sept. 17 in which McCain was asked if he would invite José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, the Spanish prime minister,to the White House. McCain's tangled and somewhat confused response prompted lots of criticism. Democrats said it illustrated reluctance by the Bush administration— and now McCain— to engage in diplomacy even with longtime allies. Here's the relevant portion of the interview: Q: Senator, finally, lets talk about Spain. If youre elected president, would you be willing to invite President José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero to the White House, to meet with you? A: I would be willing to meet with those leaders who are our friends and want to work with us in a cooperative fashion. And by the way, President Calderón of Mexico is fighting a very, very tough fight against the drug cartels. Im glad were now working in cooperation with the Mexican government on the Merida plan, and I intend to move forward with the relations and invite as many of them as I can of those leaders to the White House. Q: Would that invitation be extended to the Zapatero government? To the president, itself? A: Uh, I dont, you know, honestly, I have to look at the relations and the situations and the priorities, but I can assure you: I will establish closer relations with our friends, and I will stand up to those who want to do harm to the United States of America. I know how to do both. Q: So, you have to wait and see if hes willing to, to meet with you, or you be able to do it? In the White House? A: Well, again I, I dont All I can tell you is that I have a clear record of working with leaders in the hemisphere that are friends with us, and standing up to those who are not, and thats judged on the basis of the importance of our relationship with Latin America, and the entire region. Q: OK, what about Europe? Im talking about the President of Spain. Are you willing to meet with him, if youre elected president? A: Im willing to meet with any leader who is dedicated to the same principles and philosophy that we are for human rights, democracy and freedom. And I will stand up to those that do not. McCain's reluctance to meet with Zapatero was odd because Spain is a member of NATO and a longtime U.S. ally. The CIA World Factbook calls it a global champion of freedom. The U.S. State Department says Spain and the United States have a long history of official relations and are closely associated in many fields. But it's worth noting that U.S.-Spain relations have suffered since Zapatero became prime minister in 2004 and withdrew Spanish troops that were helping the U.S. war in Iraq. We listened to the McCain interview several times and got the impression that the senator was confused during the first few questions. The interviewer says Zapatero's name quickly and it seemed to us that McCain did not recognize the name. His answer suggests he is focused on other leaders from Latin America. But the interviewer seems to notice his confusion and reminds him OK, what about Europe? Im talking about the president of Spain. But McCain's reply does not suggest that registered with him and he offers a more general reply about meeting with any leader who is dedicated to the same principles and philosophy that we are. We would have accepted a McCain-was-confused explanation for this one, but when the issue first came up during the campaign, the McCain campaign sent reporters a statement from foreign policy adviser Randy Scheunemann that said McCain's answer was intentional. The questioner asked several times about Senator McCain's willingness to meet Zapatero— and id'd him in the question so there is no doubt Senator McCain knew exactly to whom the question referred. Senator McCain refused to commit to a White House meeting with President Zapatero in this interview, Scheunemann said in an e-mail sent to theWashington Postand CNN. Scheunemann said that if elected, McCain will meet with a wide range of allies in a wide variety of venues but is not going to spell out scheduling and meeting location specifics in advance. To us, McCain seemed confused. But Scheunemann's statement is adamant that McCain knew the subject was Spain. As a result, his comment that I have to look at the relations and the situations and the priorities indicates at least some doubt about U.S.-Spanish relations. Which bring us back to Biden's statement. Biden said, John McCain said as recently as a couple of weeks ago he wouldn't even sit down with the government of Spain, a NATO ally that has troops in Afghanistan with us now. Our reading of the interview is that McCain won't commit himself in advance to meeting or not meeting with the government of Spain. That's very different from refusing to meet with Spain. Biden could have criticized McCain for that noncommittal stance and been more accurate. But instead Biden took it a step further and said McCain refused outright to meet with Spain.",0.5,0.5,1,0.5,0,0.5,0.5,1,0.5,Half True

Final Rating: Mostly False  ","We have towns in West Texas that are out of water, that are having to truck in water.","At a March 2015 symposium on water in Texas, the states agriculture commissioner was asked about his agencys actions in that realm. Sid Miller, a former legislator who took office in January 2015, replied that just that week hed signed off on water wells being drilled in two West Texas communities with less than 180-day water supplies. Miller, a Republican, continued: We have towns in West Texas that are out of water, that are having to truck in water. We were familiar with occasional past shortages. But is that happening again? When we requested Millers backup information, Agriculture Department spokesman Bryan Black sent us web links to news reports. One was a January 2012 NPR news report on Spicewood Beach, a Burnet County town northwest of Austin, having to truck in water. Then again, conditions there were expected to rebound, according to a June 2013 Austin American-Statesman news story, thanks to new water wells drilled near Lake Travis and a new water treatment plant. Black also pointed out a June 2013 Texas Tribune news story on the West Texas town of Barnhart, which was then out of water. To gauge Barnharts conditions of late, we reached John Nanny, an Irion County commissioner who serves on the board of the Barnhart Water Supply Corp. By phone, Nanny said drinking water last had to be trucked in during July and August 2014 — at quite a cost, he said. We cant afford to do that, he said, adding that a second well was dug, helping to shore up supplies to about 50 customers. Black didnt specify communities that had no water when Miller, um, piped up. Texas Commission on Environmental Quality Next, we reached out to the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality. By email, spokesman Terry Clawson said that as of March 12, 2015, the agency wasnt aware of any public water systems hauling in water. That said, Clawson wrote, the Berry Oaks Water Company in Comal County, between Austin and San Antonio, intermittently hauls water because of summer shortfalls. Clawson emailed us a chart indicating the water system is building a well and water plant, to be up and running, Clawson said, by mid-May 2015. Clawson said the chart represents the agencys weekly updated High Priority Water System List, which reflects water-supply conditions self-reported to the commission — meaning it shouldnt be read as all-inclusive. There may be systems that have either not reported their status or are not aware of their conditions, Clawson said. In a follow-up note, Clawson specified 11 public water systems previously reported as having to haul (or truck) in drinking water due to persistent drought. He attached a chart describing each instance. In another email, Black mentioned most of the same systems. The commission chart listed five water systems located somewhere on the vast west side of Texas, specifically ones in Burnet County, northwest of Austin; Barnhart in Irion County, west of San Angelo; Medina County, west of San Antonio; Hood County, southwest of Fort Worth; and Tom Green County, whose county seat is San Angelo. Then again, in each event, according to the chart, the Texas Department of Agriculture or the water system itself funded improvements restoring supply. Our ruling Miller said: We have towns in West Texas that are out of water. In recent years, towns around Texas occasionally ran dry until new wells or water plants met needs. But Miller named no towns out of water of late nor did we identify any. MOSTLY FALSE – The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.

Final Rating: Half True","Since President Obama took full control of Washington  every single day, more than 1,500 of our jobs have been lost.","A recent ad by the National Republican Congressional Committee -- the House Republicans campaign arm -- offers a flurry of statistics to argue that President Barack Obama doesnt deserve a second term. What's become of America since President Obama took full control of Washington? the narrator says. A wrecked economy, with debt and waste beyond imagination. Since then, gas prices have gone up more than 82 percent. Every single day, more than 1,500 of our jobs have been lost. Every day, another 2,700 of us realize it's been six months since we last had a job. Every day, more than 6,000 of us have begun living below poverty, while 13,000 more have been put on food stamps, and more than 800 have become uninsured.  This is the legacy President Obama and his Democrats have left for us. If we give them more time, what else will they do to America? Theres a lot to digest here, but were going to look at two claims from the ad. The one were looking at in this item is, Since President Obama took full control of Washington  every single day, more than 1,500 of our jobs have been lost. As we do with claims like this, we split our analysis into two parts. Are the numbers right? And is it fair to assess either credit or blame for those numbers to the target of the ad? First, the numbers. We turned to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the federal governments official source for employment figures. We first looked at total, nonfarm employment between January 2009, when Obama was sworn in, until December 2011, the most recent month available at the time the ad was released. We also used the figure that would have been available at the time the ad was released. Often BLS adjusts numbers upwards or downwards in the succeeding month, based on additional information. Using the preliminary numbers, a net 1,661,000 jobs were lost nationwide. Assuming that three years means 1,095 days -- or 365 times 3 -- then 1,517 net jobs were lost per day during that period. So, using that measurement, the ad is correct. (Using the revised numbers released after the ad came out, the daily number dropped significantly -- to 1,274 -- due to stronger-than-expected job growth.) But thats if you start the count in January 2009. Since Obama was sworn in on Jan. 20, 2009, February was actually his first full month in office -- and using the February numbers makes a big difference. Starting with February 2009, the net number of jobs lost was 937,000, which produces a daily job loss of 856, or 43 percent lower than the amount claimed in the ad. (If you look only at private-sector jobs, the daily job loss was even smaller -- 303 jobs, a number that shrunk to just 74 once revised figures appeared.) The difference between starting in January or February is so big because the transition between President George W. Bush and Obama included months with some of the most rapid job losses of the entire recession, which began in December 2007. In just the one month from January 2009 to February 2009, for instance, the economy lost a net 725,000 jobs. Even spread over three years, adding just that one extra month to the calculation means adding 660 additional job losses per day. Next, does Obama deserve the blame? Weve consistently ruled in the past that the economy is too complex to assign full blame (or credit) for job gains or losses to a president or a governor. Presidents, governors, and mayors can have an impact on job creation during their terms in office. Almost always, however, the impact is small in relation to the effects of events and trends over which elected officials have little control, especially in their first few years on the job, said Gary Burtless, an economist with the Brookings Institution. A recession that is under way or begins soon after a president or governor takes office is in no way the fault of the new officeholder. The flip side is that chief executives cannot claim much credit for a strong economic recovery that begins shortly before or after they take the oath of office. Of special note here is that this ad uses the formulation, since President Obama took full control of Washington. Obama -- or at least the Democrats -- can be said to have had full control of Washington, at least on a nominal basis, for two of those three years. But after the Republicans took over the House beginning in January 2011, they have had a share of the control as well. And we can rule out the possibility that the numbers were calculated based on just the two years when Obama had an entirely Democratic Congress, since the NRCC web page linking to the ad states, This video shows the daily economic pain endured by American workers and families due to President Obama and Washington Democrats' failed policies averaged over every day of the last three years. Our ruling Using the numbers available at the time -- which subsequently have been revised to be more favorable to the president -- and starting the count in January 2009, the ad is correct about the 1,500 jobs lost per day. But starting the count with Obamas first full month in office, which we think is an equally plausible way of doing it, reduces that number significantly, to 43 percent lower than what the ad claims. Meanwhile, economists tell us that the causes of these job losses are multiple, so it is also incorrect to attribute the blame solely to Obama.",0.7,0.5,1.0,0.6,0.4,0.6,0.5,0.7,0.5,Half True

Final Rating: Half True  ",At UNC 14% of students tested positive.,"The University of North Carolina made national news after reporting a coronavirus outbreak shortly after students returned to campus. Before students could even get their first assignments, university administrators abandoned their plans to hold in-person classes. The football team, however, is still scheduled to move forward with a modified Atlantic Coast Conference schedule. That upset U.S. Sen. Chris Murphy, a Democrat from Connecticut. The University of Connecticut was the first major football program to cancel its season due to the pandemic. Notre Dame and UNC are sending kids home because of COVID outbreaks (at UNC 14% of students tested positive), Murphy tweeted on Aug. 18, adding: But...not football players! They need to stay no matter the risk, because the college football money machine needs to keep churning. His tweet linked to a New York Times story about the situation at UNC. Murphy was clearly trying to make a point about college athletes being exploited. While doing so, however, he failed to provide the full context of UNCs outbreak. Is it true that 14% of students tested positive, as Murphy said? Not exactly. The percentage Murphy quoted is generally accurate. Its what the percentage represents that he didnt properly convey. Murphys tweet could give the impression that 14% of all students tested positive. That would mean that more than 2,670 of UNCs 19,117 undergraduate students have COVID-19. But thats not the case. While some schools (including Duke University) required students to be tested before entering campus, UNC didnt. UNC encourages students to be tested if they believe they have been exposed to the virus. In the week from Aug. 10 to 16, 954 students were tested. Of those, 130 — or 13.6% — tested positive. The university updates its testing numbers weekly on its online dashboard. Is it fair to say that the weeks infection rate for those who were tested accurately reflects the entire UNC student population? No. Because UNC is only testing people who think they need it, the results are likely to skewed, said Donald Taylor, director of the Social Science Research Institute at Duke University. UNC is doing symptomatic testing when folks are feeling sick, and contact tracing testing when you ask a person newly infected to say who they have been in close contact with, and then those folks are tested, Taylor said. People who feel sick, or who were in close contact with those who are positive would be expected to have a much higher rate of positivity than would an entire population, Taylor said. If it was a random sample of students, you could extrapolate, but would need to say it is a rough estimate, said Peter Ubel, a physician and behavioral scientist at the Duke Universitys Fuqua School of Business. If they tested symptomatic students, or ones with known exposures, then that suggests the 14% figure is higher than probably seen across the student body, Ubel said. UNC spokespersons emailed PolitiFact to reiterate that the 14% positivity rate does not reflect all students. It represents only students who took a COVID-19 test and had a positive result for coronavirus that week. As for Murphy, his office doesnt believe the tweet is misleading at all. Senator Murphy didnt say it was 14% of all students, Murphy spokesperson Jamie Geller said. He said it was 14%, with no qualifier, which logically infers that its of those who are tested. But in case there was any confusion, he linked to the article. We disagree with the notion that Murphys tweet clearly refers only to students who were tested. Murphy tweeted that at UNC 14% of students tested positive. Someone who reads Murphys tweet could understand that hes referring to the small sample of students who were tested. But, on its face, the tweet could give the impression that more than 2,600 students contracted COVID-19. Thats not the case. It would have been more accurate to tweet that 14% of tests were positive, rather than students. The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.",0.7,0.6,1.0,0.5,0.0,0.3,0.4,1.0,0.5,Half True

Final Rating: Half True  ",U.S. Senate candidate Jack Kingston spent our tax dollars on thousands of wasteful earmarks.,"The accusations are flying fast and furious between U.S. Rep. Jack Kingston and businessman David Perdue as we edge closer to the Republican primary runoff for the U.S. Senate. Both claim to be the conservative candidate in the close, and closely watched, contest that voters will decide on July 22. And for the second time, Perdue is leveling accusations about earmarks, the money lawmakers pull from the federal budget for pet projects in their jurisdictions. Jack Kingston spent our tax dollars on thousands of wasteful earmarks, Perdue claims in the ad, Spender. PolitiFact Georgia already looked into Perdues earlier claims that Kingston requested more earmarks than any other congressman from Georgia and more than all Georgia Republicans combined. With between $211 million and $213 million in earmarks between fiscal years 2008 and 2010, we found that claim Mostly True. But the database from the Center for Responsive Politics of OpenSecrets.org and a separate data set from Taxpayers for Common Sense showed only 145 and 146 earmarks, respectively, in that period. So thousands? He has voted for thousands of earmarks, not just his own, wasting tax dollars, said Derrick Dickey, Perdues chief of staff. Take the 2005 transportation bill, which has 6,300 earmarks alone. The Safe, Accountable, Flexible, Efficient Transportation Equity Act authorized spending $286 billion to be doled out over five years. While the majority of the money was funneled to road construction and public transit projects, the bill also contained a record 6,371 earmarks from members of both parties. Kingston was among those who voted in favor of that bill, despite a long-standing push to overhaul the earmark process. Criticism over those projects, and the punch line Bridge to Nowhere, helped prompt Congress to ban earmarks in 2010. Shortly thereafter, Kingston began saying that lawmakers may have overreacted. In 2010, Kingston told the political website Politico that the definition of earmarks, if not the ban, needed review. Lets look at transportation, he said. How do you handle that without earmarks, since thats a heavily earmarked bill? Earlier this month, Kingston defended his earmarks to The Atlanta Journal-Constitution as support for military and defense projects in a state with eight military installations. His spokesman, Chris Crawford, called the accusation that Kingston supported thousands of earmarks false on its face – given the hundreds specifically tied to Kingstons name. He also said it was a blatant fabrication trying to link Kingston to other lawmakers projects. In fact, Kingston may have a point, said Steve Ellis, the vice president of Taxpayers for Common Sense. The nonpartisan organization opposes earmarks because the system rewards political power over project merit. But Ellis said Kingston, or any lawmaker of his tenure, would have voted for thousands of earmarks simply by voting to fund the government. In some cases, lawmakers would chop spending, say for the Department of Defense, into dozens of earmarks. In other cases, earmarks were added to programs, driving up the overall cost. But the final vote reflects support for an overall defense budget bill, not the pet projects inside. Even the most die-hard opponent of pork would have cast votes that included money for state or local projects such as paving roads. Its not like he voted for these (earmarks) separately, Ellis said. They were stuffed into bills. So, did Kingston vote on thousands of earmarks? In a word, yes. But so does any other lawmaker who votes for major legislation such as transportation funding. Perdue would have been on firmer ground if he had attributed to Kingston the specific earmarks for his district. Were the earmarks wasteful as the statement claims? Thats far trickier to prove.

Final Rating: Half True  ","Terrorist detainees were not covered by the Geneva Convention. They were unlawful combatants. And under those circumstances, they were not entitled to the normal kinds of courtesies and treatment.","Former Vice President Dick Cheney has had a relatively quiet couple of years since leaving the White House. But with the recent release of a Senate report on alleged torture by the CIA, it was inevitable that Cheney -- who is closely associated with the post-9/11 policy of enhanced interrogations for captured terrorists -- would return to television screens. On Dec. 9, the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence released a report about the CIAs interrogation techniques in the wake of 9/11. About 500 pages of the 6,700-page report were made public. The report concluded that the techniques were not an effective way to gain intelligence from detainees, and that the CIA misled Congress and the White House. The report detailed such techniques as rectal rehydration and the use of coffin-size confinement boxes. A few days before a scheduled appearance on NBCs Meet the Press, Cheney sat for an interview with Fox News Bret Baier. Heres a portion of their exchange on Dec. 10, focusing on the fate of the detainees discussed in the Senate report. Baier: Is there anything to the Geneva Convention, to the world rule of law on this? Cheney: Sure there is. But remember, the terrorists were not covered by the Geneva Convention. They were unlawful combatants. And under those circumstances, they were not entitled to the normal kinds of courtesies and treatment you would accord to those. Theres significant disagreement between Cheney and his critics on the issue of torture or enhanced interrogation techniques. Still, experts told us that the question of what protections, if any, the detainees qualified for under the Geneva Convention -- is somewhat more clear-cut than other aspects of this policy debate. So well take a closer look at Cheneys claim that terrorist detainees were not covered by the Geneva Convention. They were unlawful combatants. And under those circumstances, they were not entitled to the normal kinds of courtesies and treatment. The Geneva Conventions First, some background on the Geneva Conventions. They are a group of four international treaties covering different aspects of how civilians, prisoners of war and soldiers are to be treated once they are rendered incapable of fighting. (Read more about them here.) The most recent version of the treaties in force date from 1949; the United States has ratified all four though it has not ratified some of the protocols added later. The conventions guarantee a certain level of protection for former combatants, including prisoners of war and civilians. They set out in detail the requirements for food, clothing, shelter, safety from combat, access to medical care, and other matters. However, whether fighters could qualify for these protections depended on whether they adhered to some basic rules of law such as wearing uniforms, carrying arms openly, answering to a chain of command, and not committing war crimes. Many of those who would one day end up in Guantanamo Bay and other sites were from non-state terrorist groups and did not adhere to these rules. So these fighters were not guaranteed the same protections afforded POWs. Cheneys strongest point in his interview with Baier was to draw this distinction between prisoners of war, who receive these extensive protections, and unlawful combatants, who do not. There is, in fact, a distinction in the level of protection. What undercuts the accuracy of Cheneys claim, however, is a different part of what he said. Its misleading for him to say that such combatants are not covered by the Geneva Convention. While detainees who do not have POW status dont get the top level of protection, they do get more basic protections from the Geneva Conventions. And glossing over those less-stringent protections hides an important point: Even the lower level of protection would have shielded detainees, at least on paper, against some of the harsh treatments now alleged in the Senate report. Experts pointed us to identical passages in each of the four conventions, known as Common Article 3. Among other thingsprohibited at any time and in any place whatsoever by Common Article 3 are violence to life and person, in particular murder of all kinds, mutilation, cruel treatment and torture as well as outrages upon personal dignity, in particular humiliating and degrading treatment. In other words, despite the implications from what Cheney said, even unlawful combatants have minimum protections under the Geneva Conventions, Richard D. Rosen, director of the Center for Military Law & Policy at Texas Tech University Law School. The Hamdan decision In the immediate aftermath of 9/11, there was considerable debate inside and outside the Bush administration about how captured members of al-Qaida and the Taliban should be treated. The Bushadministration contended that the Geneva Conventions did not apply to terrorism suspects held abroad,siding with White House and Pentagon lawyers over objections from the State Department. Administration lawyers also approved the enhanced interrogation techniques and said they were legally permissible. The debate about the Geneva Convention piece of the equationended in June 2006, when the U.S. Supreme Court issued its ruling in Hamdan vs. Rumsfeld, a watershed case on detainee rights. The 5-3 majority wrote that Common Article 3 affords some minimal protection, falling short of full protection under the Conventions, to individuals associated with neither a signatory nor even a nonsignatory who are involved in a conflict 'in the territory of' a signatory. In other words, by this decision, our own Supreme Court has made it completely clear that, whatever their status, (detainees) are entitled to some minimal protections under the Geneva Convention, said Steven R. Ratner, a University of Michigan law professor. That ruling is binding law in the United States, no matter what the former vice president says. University of Notre Dame law professor Mary Ellen OConnell, a specialist on international law, agreed. The Supreme Court's ruling in Hamdan conflicts directly with the vice presidents assertion, she said. We will also note that while Common Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions is one source of basic protection for detainees, their rights to these protections may be bolstered by other international agreements as well. One is Article 75 of Additional Protocol I of the Geneva Conventions, which includes minimal protections for all people, whatever their status, who are caught in a conflict. While the U.S. has not ratified this protocol, the U.S. government has said that, out of a sense of legal obligation it will adhere to Article 75 for any individual it detains in an international armed conflict, and expects all other nations to adhere to these principles as well. And despite resistance during the Bush administration, two other international agreements to which the United States is a party -- the 1984 Torture Convention and the 1966 International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights -- would also prohibit torture and cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment, experts said.  Our ruling Cheney said that terrorist detainees were not covered by the Geneva Convention. They were unlawful combatants. And under those circumstances, they were not entitled to the normal kinds of courtesies and treatment. Cheney has a point that unlawful combatants are not afforded as high a level of protection as prisoners of war or civilians. However, his comment glosses over the fact that unlawful combatants are still accorded a minimum degree of protection, including a ban on violence to life and person, in particular murder of all kinds, mutilation, cruel treatment and torture, and outrages upon personal dignity, in particular humiliating and degrading treatment, both of which have been validated by the Supreme Court. This is an important omission, since some of these very actions have been alleged in the Senate report.",0.6,0.7,0.9,0.5,0.3,0.5,0.4,0.8,0.4,Half True

Final Rating: Half True  ",Red light camera installed to promote public safety.,"(Want to discuss this ruling? Check out our Facebook page.)  It's the one piece of mail that makes every motorist who has ever hit the gas at a yellow light cringe -- the letter saying you ran a red light with a picture to prove it.Atlanta officials recently announced one red light camera is coming back, at the busy intersection of Freedom Parkway and Boulevard.They promote public safety, city officials said in a press release.Is that true?Critics argue red light cameras are nothing more than a moneymaking racket for government. Some researchers contend they don't make intersections any safer.State transportation officials earlier this year denied Atlanta's request to keep the camera at the intersection, saying they found little evidence that the device was reducing the grinding T-bone collisions that typically occur when motorists run a red light.The crash data at the intersection, compared before and after the device was installed, did not reflect a reduction in the types of crashes caused by red light-running violators, Mark McKinnon, a state Department of Transportation spokesman, told The Atlanta Journal-Constitution in a recent article. That doesn't mean the red light camera was unsafe, he said, just that it wasn't improving safety, which is its purpose.Red light cameras have been used for years in metro Atlanta in cities like Alpharetta, Duluth and Roswell. Several cities in Gwinnett County shut down the cameras in 2009 after noticing a decline in accidents and injuries, which they believed were associated with adding an extra second for yellow lights.In May, Atlanta's WXIA-TV investigated crash data at several city intersections with red-light cameras. The station found T-bone collisions increased at five of eight intersections with red light cameras.The city's Public Works Department asked the state to reconsider its plans to keep the camera at the intersection of Freedom Parkway and Boulevard. The city sent new data it believed showed better results for the camera.About 48,000 vehicles travel through Freedom Parkway and Boulevard each day, city officials say. The red light camera was initially put at the intersection in December 2007. There were 16 wrecks involving vehicles that ran red lights in the 24 months before the camera was installed, according to a study completed in June for the city by LAI Engineering. There were 15 such wrecks in the 24 months after the camera was installed, researchers found. The number of injury crashes in 2006 and 2007 were exactly the same (34) as there were in 2008 and 2009, the company found. None of the crashes in that four-year period were fatal.LAI Engineering said the camera needed to be there an additional two years to evaluate its effectiveness.Atlanta officials said they also would extend yellow light time at the intersection. In September, the state approved Atlanta's plan to reinstall the camera.The fact that so many crashes are occurring indicates that some measure is needed for public safety, Atlanta Public Works Department spokeswoman Valerie Bell-Smith told AJC reporter Ariel Hart in a recent article.In 2009, nearly three-quarters of the accidents at that intersection were rear-end collisions. Some experts say that's common at intersections with red light cameras.The Virginia Transportation Research Council, a partnership between that state's Transportation Department and the University of Virginia, conducted a seven-year study of six cities and counties with and without red light cameras. The study found rear-end collisions increased by 27 percent at intersections with red light cameras. Red light-running crashes decreased by 42 percent, the research found. Overall, the number of crashes decreased in three of the six jurisdictions.Common sense dictates that if the desired effect of red light cameras is achieved, there will be an increase in rear-end accidents, said a report released by then-U.S. House Majority Leader Dick Armey (R-Texas). This is because motorists fearing a ticket will panic and slam on their brakes to avoid entering an intersection.Red light cameras arent fixing a safety problem, theyre creating one, the Armey report said.The Urban Transit Institute looked at crashes at red-light cameras in Greensboro, N.C., and found large increases in rear-end collisions, but fewer accidents involving a vehicle turning left and a vehicle on the same roadway. Researchers concluded there has been no demonstrable benefit from the RLC program in terms of safety. In many ways, the evidence points toward the installation of RLCs as a detriment to safety.Los Angeles City Controller Wendy Greuel released an audit of that city's red-light camera program. Greuel's office found 12 of the 32 intersections with red-light cameras had more wrecks, four had about the same and 16 had fewer accidents.Studies in other places show red light cameras do not demonstrably improve safety at intersections. The study done for the city of Atlanta found no major difference in accidents since the red light camera was installed.Many researchers believe there is no major difference in accidents with red light cameras, but they do increase the fear factor among some motorists to slow down. The city's claim that the camera promotes public safety has some truth, but it leaves out important details, such as the typical rise in rear-end collisions. So motorists, beware when approaching a yellow light.",0.5,0.5,1,0.5,0,0.5,0.5,1,0.5,Half True

Final Rating: False",Video shows Joe Biden saying we can only re-elect Donald Trump.,"A manipulated video that purports to show Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden endorsing Donald Trump for president is making the rounds on social media. The video, created March 7, 2020, by President Donald Trumps campaign, was shared by the president and thousands of others — including at least two prominent Wisconsin legislative leaders: Assembly Majority Leader Jim Steineke and Wisconsin Assembly Speaker Robin Vos. Vos, R-Rochester, attached this critique to his retweet: Omg. We all stumble once in awhile but how can the media ignore this kind of stuff EVERY single day? The implication is that the video shows news the media should be covering. So lets take a closer look at the 14-second clip. The clip in question originated at a March 7, 2020, Biden rally in Kansas City. The YouTube livestream from Bidens official account shows the actual statement. Biden verbally stumbles several times before making a call for party unity, and a pitch for himself as the unifying candidate. Heres what he says, with pauses noted by an ellipsis. We cannot get reelect We cannot win this reelection Excuse me — we can only re-elect Donald Trump if in fact we get engaged in this circular firing squad here. The Trump War Room shared a clip that cut offafter the word Trump. So Biden is shown saying, We can only re-elect Donald Trump — the opposite of what was actually stated. Starting the clip at the first stumble also eliminates the preceding context that helps explain Bidens sentence construction. He calls himself a lifelong Democrat and a nominee who will bring this party together. PolitiFact National rated the edited video Mostly False for deceptive editing via omission. And they noted Biden had referenced his point more clearly earlier that day in St. Louis: If you want a nominee who will bring the party together, who will run a positive, progressive vision for the future — not turn this primary into a campaign of negative attacks because that will only re-elect Donald Trump if we go that route. Twitter also added the label of manipulated media to a tweet of the video from Dan Scavino, Trumps director of social media, on March 8 under a new policy. The policy applies to synthetic and manipulated media including videos, audio and images. Vos (and Steineke) left the shared video up long after it was known to be dishonestly edited. We should also note that tweeting manipulated media is not a new thing for Vos. On Feb. 25, 2020, he retweeted a post from the Wisconsin College Republicans that condemned liberal state Supreme Court candidate Jill Karofsky, saying, Dont let (Karofsky) destroy our Constitution with her judicial activism. The text appeared with a sloppily edited series of images implying Karofsky was tearing up the Constitution. The images superimpose Karofskys head on U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosis body from the well-known Feb. 4, 2020, State of the Union where Pelosi tore up her copy of Trumps speech. Vos says the media is ignoring a video showing Biden saying, we can only re-elect Donald Trump. Vos implies by his statement that the video is an accurate representation of reality — and therefore worthy of media coverage. But the clip in question was cut off-mid sentence, fundamentally changing a statement that actually said Trump would only be re-elected if in fact (Democrats) get engaged in this circular firing squad here.",0,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,False

Final Rating: Mostly False  ","By voting for Obamacare, Sen. Kay Hagan voted to kill the equivalent of 2.5 million jobs.","In the second North Carolina Senate debate between Democratic incumbent Kay Hagan and Republican Thom Tillis, the challenger reached deep into the GOP playbook for an attack line about President Barack Obamas health care law and its potential impact on jobs. Sen. Hagans solution is spending more money, Tillis said. Its very simple. Government needs to get out of the way. We need to get our spending under control, and we need to reduce regulations. Sen. Hagan, when she cast the deciding vote for Obamacare, voted to kill the equivalent of 2.5 million jobs. Critics of the health care law have long argued that the new regulations it created, particularly those on businesses, would hamper employment -- or, in the more explosive language of the campaign trail, that it would be a job killer. The critics got what seemed to be a boost when the Congressional Budget Office -- Congress nonpartisan numbers-cruncher -- produced a report on this topic in February 2014. The CBO projected that by 2017, there would be the equivalent of about 2 million fewer workers than there would be in the absence of the law. CBO said that number would grow to about 2.5 million by 2024. However, most of the laws critics glossed over some critical facts when citing these numbers. Why kill is the wrong word The biggest problem with Tillis characterization of the CBOs findings is that he used the word kill. This is inaccurate because it suggests that employers will be making 2.5 million layoffs, or because businesses arent going to be creating that many jobs. That's not what the report said; rather, the reduction will come primarily from voluntary choices by workers, not by employers. The CBO figured that, when presented with new options for purchasing health insurance outside their job, millions of people would decide they dont need to work as much. The report estimated that Obamacare would reduce the total number of hours worked, on net, by about 1.5 percent to 2.0 percent during the period from 2017 to 2024, almost entirely because workers will choose to supply less labor -- given the new taxes and other incentives they will face and the financial benefits some will receive. This would equal a decline in the number of full-time-equivalent workers of about 2 million in 2017, rising to about 2.5 million in 2024, it continued. These changes, CBO said, would not result in an increase in unemployment (that is, more workers seeking but not finding jobs) or underemployment (such as part-time workers who would prefer to work more hours per week). To be clear, the report predicts that total employment will still rise. It just wont rise as much as it would if the health care law did not exist. We should note that the report did have some less sanguine observations about the health care laws impact on employment. As more people choose to work less, the CBO concluded, the labor force participation rate should decline, putting a larger burden for supporting the social safety net on those who remain working. Any change in labor force participation comes on top of an already major shift toward retirement driven by the aging of the baby boom. In addition, some commentators have expressed concern about having people work less because taxpayer-subsidized insurance is available. Ultimately, it boils down to a tradeoff, Tara Sinclair, a George Washington University economist, told PolitiFact earlier this year. Admittedly there are some touchy issues with the government potentially paying or subsidizing the health care costs for people who could work but choose not to, Sinclair said. But overall I think separating health care from employment, at least making it like any other service where employment may provide the money to pay for it but where we work doesn't determine our choices, is a good thing. To his credit, Tillis -- unlike many of his Republican colleagues -- was able to avoid one linguistic pitfall. Tillis framed the CBOs findings as projecting a reduction in the equivalent of 2.5 million jobs, rather than simply saying a reduction of 2.5 million jobs. Thats an important distinction because the CBO didnt cite the number of jobs that will be reduced; rather, it referred to full-time-equivalents of jobs. That may seem deep in the weeds, but its worth noting. These job equivalents will be made up of lots of bits and pieces of hours per week that people will choose to drop. For instance, some of these people might be working two or three jobs, in excess of 40 hours a week, and will choose to cut back to a more reasonable one or two jobs. A final note: Were also not wild about Tillis characterization of Hagan casting the deciding vote for Obamacare. In most cases when weve looked at that claim, we have rated them Mostly False, since any one of the 60 Senate supporters could have been described as having cast the deciding vote. But for the sake of simplicity, we will only consider the employment question in putting this claim to the Truth-O-Meter. Our ruling In the debate, Tillis said that, by voting for Obamacare, Sen. Kay Hagan voted to kill the equivalent of 2.5 million jobs. The main problem with this claim is that Tillis used the word kill. This mischaracterizes what is going on, since the reduction will come from voluntary actions by workers, rather than layoffs by employers. Indeed, the CBO said the law would not push up unemployment.",0.5,0.8,1.0,0.6,0.4,0.7,0.5,1.0,0.3,Mostly False

Final Rating: Mostly False  ",Says U.S. Senate candidate Eric Hovde has no problem with raising taxes.,"Trying to boost Republican Mark Neumanns bid for U.S. Senate, a national conservative group is blasting away at Neumann rivals Tommy Thompson and Eric Hovde.The message: Both are big taxers.The national Club for Growth, which has endorsed Neumann, uses a widely aired TV ad to highlight nine instances of tax increases during Tommy Thompsons 14 years as Wisconsin governor -- years marked, as we found in rating a Thompson claim Mostly True, by a decline in the overall tax burden.The group had a much smaller record to comb through on Hovde, a banker and investment-fund manager and first-time candidate.In a national TV interview, Hovde said he had no problem with raising taxes, the ad says. And Hovde supported tax-raising Gov. Jim Doyle. On taxes, Hovdes like Thompson, only worse.The ad shows a smiling Hovde at the start of a 2009 TV appearance as a financial pundit on CNBCs Squawk Box beneath the words: No Problem Raising Taxes.Hovde fired back with his own TV spot that calls the Neumann (actually Club for Growths) tax accusation false. (The campaign acknowledges Hovde gave $500 to Democrat Doyles re-election campaign in 2005. It has not explained why, but notes that Hovde has given almost exclusively to Republicans, and in much larger amounts.)So, did Hovdes remarks suggest he has no problem with raising taxes?We watched the nearly 11-minute discussion between Hovde and the cable shows hosts and found a brief exchange on taxes that closely -- but not exactly -- mirrors the language in the groups ad.The backgroundHovdes March 3, 2009 appearance on CNBC focused on the ongoing financial crisis and his criticisms of actions under both Republican President George W. Bush and newly elected President Barack Obama. Hovde said the country was in a depression, Obamas stimulus bill was unfocused and out of control federal spending was taking the country into quasi-Socialist territory.At the 7:25 mark of the segment, as the Journal Sentinels Dan Bice reported in April 2012, Hovde abruptly turned the talk to taxes, tax breaks and the Obama administration.Unprompted, he began: Look, I have no problem with me getting charged higher taxes. Ive been blessed in my life and Ive been very fortunate. But some of the things that theyve done are just insane.Then he referred to an Obama 2009 proposal to reduce the mortgage-interest tax deduction for households earning more than $250,000.Taking away deductions on home mortgage payments -- I dont need it, but a lot of other people do. Hovde said. Were in a housing recession -- are you kidding me?So, the Club for Growth claims Hovde said he had no problem with raising taxes. He actually said: I have no problem with me getting charged higher taxes.Thats a significant difference, especially since he immediately noted that eliminating housing deductions, for instance, would be unwise in a recession.The timing is also important.In 2009, Hovde was a private citizen, not a candidate running on a platform of what he would do if elected.An candidate can have a personal opinion on an issue but may decide to vote another way for a variety of reasons. For instance, a lawmaker personally would not seek an abortion but votes pro-choice to leave the decision up to the mother.Its also unclear from the 2009 CNBC interview exactly what Hovde was talking about. Did he mean paying more through a higher top tax rate? Through a repeal of the Bush tax cuts?When asked about the claim, the Club for Growth noted it would take a tax increase of some kind for Hovdes personal tax bill to rise.As a candidate in 2012, Hovde told Bice he was not referring to Obamas so-called Buffett Rule legislation to make sure high earners pay at least 30 percent in federal income tax (a bill sponsored by U.S. Rep. Tammy Baldwin, the Democratic candidate in the race).Hovde has said he was thinking of the tax break on carried interest -- the portion of a funds investment gains taken by fund managers (like Hovde) as compensation. It also applies to venture capitalists and private equity specialists.In an interview, Hovde agreed that it would be a tax increase for that narrow group. Some government estimates put the total at more than $1 billion a year.But lets look at his tax positions as a candidate in 2012.Hovde has pledged to reduce individual income tax rates across the board, drop the corporate income tax rate from 35 percent to 25 percent and eliminate the estate tax.So Hovde has made it clear he is against raising tax rates. In fact, he wants dramatic cuts in peoples tax bills.That leaves his support for eliminating tax deductions -- a move that would bring the government more revenue.Hovde says he would vote to eliminate nearly all of the deductions in the current tax code, which he sees as riddled with favors to big corporations at the expense of small businesses. He also thinks the individual tax code is too complicated.And he told us he still favors eliminating the carried interest tax provision, which he sees as eliminating a loophole.Hovde, who has made debt and deficit reduction a major theme, has told voters he would accept a budget-balancing deal that gets $10 in spending cuts for every $1 in new revenue through the elimination of loopholes or deductions.He told us his strong preference would be that such a deal include cuts in the tax rates.He said he would consider supporting a 10-to-1 deal that holds rates steady instead of lowering them, depending on which loopholes or deductions are removed.But does that constitute a tax increase?Even conservative Republicans disagree on this. Americans for Tax Reforms widely publicized taxpayer protection pledge frowns on deduction eliminations unless the new revenue is completely offset by lower rates. Thompson and Neumann have signed that pledge, but Hovde has not. A leading conservative in the Senate, Republican Tom Coburn of Oklahoma, has criticized the groups pledge as too narrow to allow for smart reform of the tax code.PolitiFact National consulted a range of experts in January 2012 in evaluating a Mitt Romney claim that Obama has raised taxes 19 times.Views differed on some issues, but the consensus was that eliminating or limiting such deductions as those for prescription or other medical expenses clearly deserved the label of tax increases.Donald Marron, director of the Tax Policy Center, told us its case by case -- some of these tax preferences are best seen as taxes, but others as spending programs in disguise.Given Hovdes pledge to wipe out nearly all deductions, it seems clear that some of those moves could be labeled as tax increases. Even Hovde acknowledged eliminating the carried interest provision would be a tax increase for a narrow group.Our conclusionThe national Club for Growth used Hovdes own words from a cable TV interview in 2009 to frame him as in favor of raising taxes.Hovde said what he said -- he would pay more, which put him on record as open to some kind of tax increase. Theres no other way to read it.But the ad takes the 2009 comment and alters it in a subtle but significant way, changing the context. By also changing the timing, leaving viewers thinking Hovde is campaigning in 2012 on a plan to raise taxes, the issue is further distorted.In the current campaign, Hovde has made it clear he wants dramatically lower taxes and would not raise rates, while staying open to a net revenue increase from loophole elimination as part of a massive spending-and-tax-cut deal. That doesnt square with the breezy portrayal of Hovde as having no problem raising taxes.The Truth-O-Meter says Mostly False claims have an element of truth but ignore critical facts that would give a different impression.We think that fits the Club for Growth ad claim.

Final Rating: Mostly False  ",The director of the FBI said that we cannot properly vet people coming from the Middle East.,"Bradenton developer Carlos Beruff wants voters to know that he plans to be tough on national security and immigration, because right now the FBI has no way to guarantee Americas safety as refugees flood the United States. Thousands of Syrian refugees are pouring into our country, thanks to President Obama, Beruff said in an Aug. 8 Facebook post. This is an open invitation to acts of terror. Even the director of the FBI said that we cannot properly vet people coming from the Middle East. Immigration has been a major focus of this election cycle, with Republicans routinely calling for more restrictions to ensure security in the United States. But did James Comey actually say the FBI cannot properly vet people coming from the Middle East? No, he didnt. Beruff is distorting a point Comey was making about a flaw in the vetting process, but he was reiterating the system in place was actually much better than it had been in years past. No guarantees When we asked Beruffs campaign what Comey said and when, his spokesman sent us a YouTube clip of Comey speaking before the House Homeland Security Committee on Oct. 21, 2015. A topic at the meeting was the thoroughness of background checks for refugees — specifically some 10,000 Syrian refugees slated to come to the United States. The Syrian refugee focus was much more specific than people coming from the Middle East, as Beruff said. Lets be clear: The United States can vet refugees through a process that involves the FBI, plus the State Department, the Department of Homeland Security, the Department of Defense and other agencies. The vetting process can take two or even three years, in which refugees undergo several rounds of security clearance checks. Because of the overt concern about terrorism, Syrian refugees actually have to go through extra hurdles. Experts have told us repeatedly that refugee background checks are the most extensive security screening the country has for any type of visitor. At the committee meeting, U.S. Rep. Bennie Thompson, D-Miss., asked Comey if there was concern that the FBI could miss a potential terrorist infiltrator because intelligence databases may not contain complete information on every refugee. Comey agreed, saying the procedure isnt perfect, because it relies on checking for criminal records or other nefarious activity. We can only query against that which we have collected, Comey said. If someone has never made a ripple in the pond in Syria in a way that would get their identity or their interest reflected in our database, we can query our database until the cows come home but we are not going to — there will be nothing show up because we have no record on that person. So while the process is very thorough, Comey was saying he couldnt guarantee there would never be a problem and no terrorist could ever slip through the cracks. Thats just the way it is. Comey noted that when the United States performed background checks on Iraqi refugees, they had a much larger database because of the American presence there over the last decade. Not having the same intelligence infrastructure in Syria has resulted in much less information with which to cross-reference an applicant. As Secretary of Homeland Security,Jeh Johnson said during the same hearing that a refugee may have a criminal past thats unknown, or may suddenly commit a terrorist act after entering the United States. But even with the pitfalls of admitting refugees from war-torn regions, Comey said, the process works and has been improving over the years. The good news is we are much better doing it than eight years ago, Comey told U.S. Rep Jeff Duncan, R-S.C., later in the hearing. The bad news is, there is no risk-free process. Comey was echoing concerns he voiced to the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee on Oct. 8. There is risk associated with bringing anybody in from the outside, but especially from a conflict zone like that, he told the Senate committee. From the intelligence community's perspective, as I said, I think we've developed an effective way to touch all of our databases and resources to figure out what we know about individuals.  I don't think that's a cumbersome process. My concern there is that there are certain gaps. He repeated that sentiment to the House Judiciary Committee on Oct. 22. We have gotten much better as an intelligence community at joining our efforts and checking our databases in a way that gives us high confidence. If we have a record on somebody, it will surface. That's the good news, Comey said. The challenge we face with Syria is that we don't have that rich set of data. So even though we've gotten better at querying what we have, we certainly will have less overall. And so as I said to a question earlier, someone only alerts as a result of our searches if we have some record on them. That's the challenge we face with Syria. Our ruling Beruff said, The director of the FBI said that we cannot properly vet people coming from the Middle East. Comey, while talking specifically about Syrian refugees and not all of the Middle East, has repeatedly said that admitting refugees has its challenges and that information gaps do exist. But he also has expressed confidence in the admission procedure and says it continues to improve. That makes it hard to argue Comey feels like the governments process cannot properly vet people.",0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,Mostly False

Final Rating: Mostly False",There was just about zero press coverage of the 2007 Bush White House email controversy.,"Why is everyone picking on Hillary Clinton -- they didnt mind when President George W. Bushs White House also used private email, pundit Juan Williams asked on Fox News Sunday. The shows March 15, 2015, pundit panel debated the importance of the ongoing controversy regarding Clintons decision to exclusively use a private email account, rather than a .gov account, during her time as secretary of state. In doing so, experts say she was able to circumvent transparency and records preservation standards. Williams turned to his fellow commentator, Republican strategist and former Bush adviser Karl Rove, arguing that the email scandal during the Bush administration didnt garner the same level of media criticism. Thus, the attention on Clinton is unwarranted. When Karl was in trouble back in 07, (there was) no press coverage, just about zero press coverage of this issue, Williams said, noting that he found just one Washington Post editorial criticizing the private email use. Juan, you are in a different reality, and I wish that I was there with you, Rove said. We decided to look back and see what press coverage of the Bush administration email controversy looked like at the timeand how it compares to coverage of Clinton. The Bush email story First, a quick refresher about what happened in the Bush administration. In March 2007, eyes were on then-Attorney General Alberto Gonzales after the administration unexpectedly fired eight U.S.attorneys. Congress (recently taken over by Democrats) investigated the firings, alleging that the administration had dropped the prosecutors for political reasons. Over the course of the investigation, it came out that some White House officials had conducted White House business over private email accountsset up on a server through the Republican National Committee. The White House later admitted that some internal White House emails conducted on the RNC server might have been lost. Democrats in Congress accused the administration of purposefully circumventing recordkeeping processes, while the White House said staffers were supposed to use the RNC emails solely for political affairs, not official business. Comparing the Bush and Clinton email scandals is not exactly apples to apples, but there are some similarities. We looked back at media coverage at the time, and Williams has a point that it didnt cause the same level of hubbub as the Clinton email scandal. Though to say there was zero press coverage is an exaggeration -- even allowing for a bit of hyperbole. Comparing the coverage We did a search through Lexis-Nexis, a research service that tracks news articles and transcripts, between March and May 2007. We found more than 125 transcripts from the major cable networks and National Public Radio that include Republican National Committee and email within 10 words of each other. The Lexis-Nexis search also yielded more than 200 related newspaper articles across the country within the same time frame. Lets compare that to coverage of the Clinton controversy. Since the story broke March 3, 2015 -- two weeks ago -- we found 204 cable and public radio transcripts that include Clinton and email. We also found 1,700 newspaper articles across the country. Thats several times as many articles and transcripts about Clinton than there were about the Bush email controversy in a quarter of the time. Its a rough measurement, but clearly there has been more media attention on Clintons use of private email than that of the White House staffers. What about Williams reference to the singular Washington Post editorial criticizing the private email use among White House staffers? We found the one editorial, as well as a couple opinion columns. In comparison, the Washington Post has so far written two editorials regarding Clintons private email use. Not the same Williams argument is that Republicans are stoking the media fire of the Clinton email scandal because theyre worried about Clintons 2016 potential, compared to Republican candidates. Theres some nuances and contextual factors that might explain the difference in media coverage. First of all, theres the difference in whos at the receiving end of the criticisms. In 2007, it was a group of higher-up White House staffers and advisers (notably Rove) who occasionally used private email accounts for official business. As far as we can tell, though, Bush himself was not suspected as being part of this group. Today, the target is a former secretary of state, who only used private email when conducting official government business. Whats more is that Clinton is in all likelihood running for president in 2016, so she has a lot of media attention on her to begin with. At the time of their email controversy, the Bush administration was past their 2004 second-term election and the 2006 midterms. Additionally, the White House email controversy was on the periphery of a much larger scandal -- the firings of the eight U.S. attorneys. We searched Lexis-Nexis for articles about Attorney General Gonzales in the same time frame that we used to explore coverage of the White House email controversy. The search came up with more than 6,000 combined newspaper articles and transcripts. (Compared to the more than 325 about the emails). As oneWashington Post article put it: The controversy over the outside e-mail accounts is a byproduct of the ongoing showdown over the prosecutor firings. Our ruling Williams said there was just about zero press coverage of the 2007 Bush White House email controversy. We emailed Williams and did not hear back. Saying there was zero press coverage is an exaggeration --even allowing for a bit of hyperbole. We found hundreds of articles and television transcripts referencing the issue. Still, Williams has something of a point that compared to the extensive recent coverage of Clintons use of private email, media coverage of the 2007 Bush White House email controversy was thin. Williams statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.",0.2,0.7,0.8,0.3,0.2,0.5,0.4,0.9,0.5,Mostly False

Final Rating: Half True  ",Were losing as many people to heroin and opioid overdoses as we lost to the AIDS epidemic at its peak.,"Before signing legislation to combat New York States growing heroin and opiate addiction problem, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo compared the epidemics death toll to the number of people who died during the peak of the AIDS crisis. Cuomo, who created a heroin and opioids task force this year, said the number of people dying from a heroin or opiate overdose today is comparable to the number of people who died from AIDS at its worst. Over the past 10 years weve lost 10,000 people to heroin overdoses and the numbers are increasing exponentially. It is spiking. It is becoming more and more available, especially among the younger community, its becoming more and more accepted, and it is truly, truly a frightening and staggering increase. Were losing as many people to heroin and opioid overdoses as we lost to the AIDS epidemic at its peak. Thats how bad this is. Think about that: The AIDS epidemic – one of the worst things that society has had to deal with, and the loss of life is just about the same with this heroin epidemic. So the numbers are staggering, and its frightening, and its getting worse, Cuomo said, referring to the countrys growing problem with heroin and opiates. Cuomos office said the governor was referring to New York State residents when citing the loss of 10,000 lives over the past 10 years. In comparing recent heroin and opioid deaths to the AIDS death toll, Cuomos office said he was referring to national figures. So did the number of deaths from heroin and opioid overdoses actually match AIDS at its peak? Prescription Drug Overdoses vs. Heroin and Opioid Overdoses The number of people in the U.S. who died from a drug overdose in 2014 was 47,055, which rivals the worst year of the AIDS epidemic. But only about 60 percent - 28,647 - were from heroin and opioid overdoses, according to 2014 data from the Centers for Disease Control. The federal agency hasnt finished compiling 2015 numbers yet, and no other government entity has released anything more recent. Deaths From AIDS That doesnt come close to the deaths from AIDS at the peak of the AIDS epidemic in 1995. The CDCs mortality database, confirmed by a CDC representative, shows 43,115 deaths directly caused by AIDS that year. Thats different from the number of people who died with AIDS, which counts people who died following an AIDS diagnosis regardless of whether their deaths were related to the disease or not. What about overdoses after 2014? From 2014 to now, have the number of people who died from a heroin or opiate overdose increased to match the number of deaths from AIDS in 1995? To reach that level, data would have to show an increase of about 50 percent in the number of deaths from heroin and opioid overdoses between then and now. When contacted, the CDC would not speculate on whether such an increase was likely. In Erie County, deaths from heroin or opioid overdoses more than doubled between 2014 and 2015, according to the Erie County Health Department. Dr. Gale Burstein, the Erie County health commissioner, attributed the spike partly to whats now being dealt on the streets. Dealers now often mix fentanyl,a painkiller, with heroin to increase potency. Cuomos office confirmed he was referring to the latest national data in his claim. In a phone conversation, a representative from the CDC said the agency has not finished compiling data for 2015. We base our ruling on the 2014 heroin and opioid overdose numbers. Our Ruling Cuomo, in a press conference in Buffalo, said, Were losing as many people to heroin and opioid overdoses as we lost to the AIDS epidemic at its peak. About 28,000 people died from a heroin or opioid overdose in 2014. About 43,000 people died from AIDS in 1995. Cuomos comparison is a reach. If he had been referring to the total number of drug overdoses, his claim would have been fine. There are more people dying from drug overdoses overall than the number who died from AIDS at the peak of the AIDS crisis. But the number of deaths from heroin and opioids alone continues to rise, more than doubling in Erie County alone between 2014 and 2015.",0.5,0.5,1,0.5,0.7,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,Half True

Final Rating: Mostly False  ",Says U.S. greenhouse gas emissions are at 20-year lows.,"As President Barack Obama brought up his interest in addressing global warming, a Texas congressman said U.S. emissions of greenhouse gases, widely believed to be fueling climate change, are on the decline.  DID YOU KNOW? Rep. Joe Barton, R-Arlington, wrote on Twitter during Obamas Feb. 12, 2013, State of the Union address. U.S. GHG emissions are at 20-year lows while global emissions are rising.   Global emissions have been on the upswing. The Environmental Protection Agency says on a web page that global carbon emissions from the burning of fossil fuels increased by over 16 times between 1900 and 2008 and by about 1.5 times between 1990 and 2008. Separately, the governments Carbon Dioxide Information Analysis Center contributed to a December 2012 discussion paper stating that in 2011, estimated global carbon dioxide emissions due to burning fossil fuels and making cement were up 3 percent from 2010.   We checked on Bartons claim that domestic greenhouse gas emissions are at a 20-year low.   By email, Barton spokesman Sean Brown pointed out an August 2012 web post by the U.S. Energy Information Administration stating that estimated U.S. carbon dioxide emissions resulting from energy use during the first three months of 2012 were the lowest in two decades for any January-March period. Brown also noted the Environmental Protection Agency saying in an online chart that as of 2010, concentrations of five common air pollutants--carbon monoxide, ozone, lead, nitrogen dioxide and sulfur dioxide--had decreased from 30 years earlier.   This information did not speak to all greenhouse gases, as Barton had, but carbon dioxide from burning fossil fuels is the largest contributor to greenhouse gas emissions.   Perry Lindstrom, an economist with the Energy Information Administration, emailed us a spreadsheet indicating that the nations energy-related carbon dioxide emissions were estimated at 1,339 million metric tons in the first quarter of 1992 and at a slightly higher amount, 1,344 million metric tons, for the comparable months of 2012. In the intervening years, first-quarter emissions topped out at 1,580 million metric tons in 2004 and bottomed out at 1,364 million metric tons in 1993, according to the spreadsheet.   Then again, the first quarter of 2012 was unusual, the agency said in its post. Normally, the agency wrote, carbon dioxide emissions during the year are highest in the first quarter because of strong demand for heat produced by fossil fuels. But such emissions were lower at the start of 2012 thanks to a mild winter, which reduced heating demand and energy use, the agency said, with other factors including a decline in coal-fired electricity generation, due largely to low natural gas prices, and reduced gasoline demand.   Still, the 2012 first-quarter emissions were lower than they had been in the first part of the year in 19 years. However, Lindstrom said by telephone, he would hesitate to reach conclusions solely by comparing emissions in part of a year to emissions in part of another year in contrast to looking, say, decade to decade. At our request, he provided a spreadsheet comparing energy-related carbon dioxide emissions for the 10 months through October 2012 to such emissions over the comparable part of each previous year over two decades. Our thinking was that this would deliver a longer view based on the latest information available when Barton tweeted. And according to this spreadsheet, the estimated emissions from January through October 2012, 4,386 metric tons, were the lowest 10-month total since 1995--17 years earlier--when such emissions totaled 4,385 metric tons.   Going forward, Lindstrom pointed out, his agency projects U.S. energy-related carbon dioxide emissions to remain below 2005 levels through 2040. Jim Butler, director of global monitoring at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administrations Earth System Research Laboratory, said by phone that such levelling out makes sense due to improvements in energy efficiency and shifts to fuel sources with less of a carbon footprint than coal.   Mindful that Bartons tweet said greenhouse gas emissions were at a 20-year low, we looked next at emissions of methane, nitrous dioxide, sulfur dioxide, hydrofluorocarbons, perfluorocarbons and sulfur hexafluoride as estimated in the Environmental Protection Agencys April 2012 inventory of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions--the latest inventory that would have been available when Barton tweeted. (The agencys 2013 draft inventory was posted online Feb. 22, 2013.)   The 2012 inventory indicates that total emissions of three gases were higher in 2010 than 1990, while emissions of four others were lower.   In keeping with Bartons 20-year window, we used the inventory figures to gauge the difference between estimated emissions of each greenhouse gas in 2010 and 1990:   --Carbon dioxide emissions in 2010 were 12 percent greater than in 1990;  --Methane emissions were lower by 0.3 percent; --Nitrous oxide emissions were lower by 3 percent; --Hydrofluorocarbon emissions were higher by more than 200 percent; --Perfluorocarbons were lower by 73 percent; --Sulfur hexafluoride emissions were lower by 57 percent.  Taking all the greenhouse gases into account, according to the inventory, overall emissions were 11 percent higher in 2010 than 1990--and also up 3 percent from 2009, when total emissions dipped considerably during the national recession. Aside from 2009, the previous year with lower greenhouse gas emissions than 2010 was 1997, according to the inventory.   Our ruling   The congressman said domestic greenhouse gas emissions are at a 20-year low.   This statement depends on a comparison of energy-related carbon dioxide emissions—not all greenhouse gases--over three unusually warm winter months of 2012 to such emissions in the same months of 1992. But the latest information available when Barton tweeted indicates that total U.S. greenhouse gas emissions were higher in 2010 than they were 20 years earlier, though the 2010 emissions were lower than they were 13 years earlier.   CORRECTION, 10:42 a.m. April 8, 2013: Thanks to a reader's nudge, this story was amended to say that the discussed levels of carbon dioxide were in millions of metric tons, not metric tons alone. This did not affect our original rating of the claim.",0.3,0.7,1.0,0.4,0.0,0.5,0.5,0.6,0.5,Mostly False

Final Rating: Half True  ",Says President Barack Obama already passed all these Obamacare taxes. About a dozen of them hit middle-income taxpayers.,"During the Sept. 30, 2012, edition of Fox News Sunday, Paul Ryan took a shot at Barack Obama for raising taxes.We don't think that imposing new taxes on anybody is a good idea. Don't forget, Chris, the only person running for president who's proposing higher taxes is President Obama.  Chris Wallace, the host, then interjected, Because he would end the Bush tax cuts for the wealthy.Ryan continued, Yeah, tax rates -- he already passed all these Obamacare taxes. About a dozen of them hit middle-income taxpayers, breaking that promise. He's proposing a massive tax increase on job creators in January.PolitiFact has already given Obama aPromise Broken for saying, I can make a firm pledge. Under my plan, no family making less than $250,000 a year will see any form of tax increase. Not your income tax, not your payroll tax, not your capital gains taxes, not any of your taxes.But we hadnt checked this specific claim, so well do that here.Are they taxes?When we asked a Ryan spokesman for the taxes he was including, he referred us to a Web page put together by the House Ways and Means Republican staff. The list of tax increases in Obamas health care law is pretty similar to a list of 19 that we published in January in a check of a claim by the Romney campaign.The Ways and Means list marks the tax increases that affect middle-income taxpayers with an asterisk. Well list those 12 provisions here, with a brief summary of what they would do. As youll see, many of these are new taxes, some of them primarily hit the middle-class, others hit certain people within the middle class (along with other people not in the middle class), and others are debatable.(1) Imposing an annual fee on manufacturers and importers of branded drugs, based on each companys share of the total market. It took effect on Jan. 1, 2011.(2) A 10 percent excise tax on indoor tanning services. This tax is narrowly targeted at tanning bed users, but it is still a tax. This took effect July 1, 2010.(3) Annual fee levied on health insurance providers, based on each companys share of the total market. Takes effect Jan. 1, 2013.(4) A 2.3 percent excise tax on manufacturers and importers of certain medical devices. Takes effect Jan. 1, 2013.(5) Limiting the amount taxpayers can deposit in flexible spending accounts to $2,500 a year. Takes effect Jan. 1, 2013.(6) Raise the 7.5 percent adjusted gross income floor for the medical expenses deduction to 10 percent. Takes effect Jan. 1, 2013.(7) Impose a fee on insured and self-insured health plans to fund the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Trust Fund. Takes effect Jan. 1, 2013.(8) Increase the tax on distributions from a health savings account or an Archer medical savings account that are not used for qualified medical expenses. Already in effect.(9) A tax penalty on companies with more than 50 employees that do not offer adequate health insurance coverage for their employees. Takes effect Jan. 1, 2014.(10) A mandate for individuals to buy health insurance, with limited hardship exceptions. Takes effect Jan. 1, 2014.(11) A 40 percent excise tax on employer-provided Cadillac health insurance plans costing more than $10,200 for individuals and $27,500 for families. Takes effect Jan. 1, 2018.(12) Increased penalty for purchasing disallowed products with health savings account. Already in effect.In our prior review of Obamas 19 tax increases, we relied on this operational definition, offered by Joseph D. Henchman of the Tax Foundation: Taxes have the primary purpose of raising revenue for general government. Fees have the primary purpose of raising revenue for a specific benefit to the payer. Penalties have the purpose of imposing criminal sanction, and any revenue generation is incidental.Under this definition, along with our discussions with tax experts, we feel comfortable that Ryan, at the very least, has a strong case for eight tax increases in Obamas health care bill. (See Nos. 1 through 8 on our list.) Three of these have already taken effect, and the other five are set to take effect in about three months.Categorizing No. 9 and No. 10 -- the employer and individual mandates -- is tricky. The question of whether the individual mandate is a tax was at the center of the Supreme Courts decision that upheld the law this past summer. Shortly after the justices decision came down, we ruled that Romney was Mostly True when he characterized the Supreme Court decision as saying the individual mandate is a tax.However, what kept it from a full True rating was the view expressed by several legal experts that the court ruled that the mandate acts like a tax, or is analogous to one, but not that it is one -- a small linguistic distinction, but an important legal one. These two, in other words, could go either way.No. 11, the Cadillac tax, has two problems. First, its not scheduled to take effect for another five years. More importantly, there is evidence that a significant share of the revenue from this provision may come not from the penalty itself, but from companies shifting their compensation from health coverage (which is not taxed) to wages (which is taxed).Jonathan Gruber, a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who has provided health care policy advice to both Obama and Romney during his governorship of Massachusetts, estimated this using Joint Committee on Taxation data for an early version of the health care bill. He found that penalty revenues would total $201 billion from 2013 to 2019, compared to wage increases of $313 billion.If paying higher wages instead of paying for health benefits is a tax increase, then the definition of tax increase is being stretched beyond recognition, said Henry Aaron, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution.Finally, No. 12 does not strike us as a tax at all.No. 12 -- excluding the costs for over-the-counter drugs not prescribed by a doctor from being reimbursed tax-free through a flex spending plan or medical savings account -- strikes us as more like the kind of decision made by regulators than lawmakers responsible for writing the tax code. Lots of purchases still qualify, and plan participants can simply purchase other items to get reimbursed by their plan.Do they hit middle-income taxpayers?For the most part, yes -- but not exclusively.First, we should note that not all of these taxes are imposed directly on individuals. Some are taxes on health insurance companies, drug companies or medical device manufacturers. Were making the assumption here, as many economists do, that these taxes are ultimately passed on to the customer through higher prices, rather than absorbed by the company.Second, Ryan has excluded a number of other tax provisions in the health care law that are clearly not aimed at middle-class taxpayers, such as taxes that only hit earners above a certain income level, or those aimed at health-insurance CEO compensation. Most of the rest, we think, will hit some, or even many, members of the broad middle-class.However, its worth noting that some of these taxes are narrowly focused. Most people use some brand-name drugs or have private health insurance. But someone who doesnt use tanning booths wont get hit by the tanning tax, and those who dont have medical savings accounts wont get hit by other new tax hikes. Ryans language suggests that a typical middle-class taxpayer is getting hit by a dozen new taxes; in most cases the actual number of new taxes will be smaller.Our rulingRyan said Obama already passed all these Obamacare taxes. About a dozen of them hit middle-income taxpayers.We find that only eight of these measures are taxes, and in some cases the taxes are imposed on health insurance companies, drug makers and health device manufacturers, not on individual taxpayers. He can make a less-persuasive case for another three measures actually being tax increases. Finally, there will be a substantial variation in how many new taxes affect the middle class. The typical person will not be paying anywhere close to a dozen new taxes.",0.5,0.5,1.0,0.5,0.2,0.5,0.5,1.0,0.5,Half True

If posts on social media are to be believed, these images and more come from the 1918 flu pandemic. Photos from the 1918 flu pandemic, proclaimed one such recent Facebook post that contained 11 photos. The post was flagged as part of Facebooks efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) PolitiFact conducted reverse image searches to determine the origins of the photos. Of the 11 photos, six bear no connection to the 1918 flu pandemic. Lets take a look at those first. The first photo features two women with what look like bags over their heads. According to the Associated Press, it was captured in November 1953. War surplus gas capes are used by Meriel Bush, left, and Ruth Neuer, in an attempt to dodge the eye-stinging effects of a low-hanging smog and smoke which enveloped Philadelphia for the second straight day, reads the APs caption. A reverse image search locatedthe image of masked women walking arm in armon a stock photo website. On the site, the photo is described as, Ladies' fashion from 1913. New veil fashions, based on Turkish nose veils. When debunking claims that the photo was of the 1918 flu pandemic, AFP Fact Checks bureau in Thailand contacted the German photo agency, Süddeutsche Zeitung Photo, which was listed as the photographer. The original picture description says that the nose veils were the fashion for ladies after the Balkan war, Süddeutsche Zeitungs spokesperson told AFP in an email. The Balkan Wars unfolded from 1912 to 1913. A photo of women in gas masks tending to a stroller is from a June 1941 gas test during World War II, according to Getty Images. 9th June 1941: A gas masked young mother attends to her child's pram gas mask during a surprise gas test in Kingston, reads the Getty Images photo description. One of the images from the post is an advertisement for a Bell Telephone Co. People who are in quarantine are not isolated if they have a Bell Telephone, the ad reads. Back in May, Snopes.com debunked the claim that this ad was connected to the 1918 pandemic. Versions of this ad existed as early as November 1910. The St. Louis Post-Dispatch ran an ad that was nearly identical, but with a different tag, The Bell Telephone Company of Missouri. The ad mentions quarantine and the sick, but there is no indication it is a direct reference to any particular illness. An image of an ad that encouraged people to stay home was created not in 1918, but in 2020. Stay At Home, the ad says. It has never been easier to save lives. Though the graphic illustration may appear vintage, it was made in March in response to the current COVID-19 pandemic. A French illustrator named Mathieu Persan made versions of the poster in various languages and posted them on Twitter. If you look closely, you can see his signature on the right side of the illustration. A photo of two women who appear to be visiting over a car window while wearing masks was taken in 1929, during a separate flu epidemic. Two women wearing flu masks during a flu epidemic in 1929, reads Getty Images photo description. The 1928-29 flu epidemic was studied by health professionals using data from the 1918 pandemic.

Final Rating: Half True  ","If Joe Manchin had his way, Judge Gorsuch never would have been able to get a vote.","Fresh off a primary victory in West Virginias U.S. Senate contest, state Attorney General Patrick Morrisey took a shot at his opponent in the general election in a radio interview with Breitbart, saying Democratic Sen. JoeManchin too often stands against President Donald Trump. Referring to Trumps appointee to the Supreme Court, Morrisey said, If Joe Manchin had his way, Judge (Neil) Gorsuch never would have been able to get a vote in the Senate. Morrisey went on to say, Whether we're talking judicial picks, whether we're talking Trump tax cuts, whether we're talking unwillingness to change the failed Obamacare ... Joe Manchin has not stood with President Trump. Manchins support for Trump (or lack thereof) is likely to be a major campaign wedge for Morrisey, since Trump is more popular in West Virginia than any other state, according to state-by-state approval ratings released by Gallup in January 2018. Morrisey is right that Manchin voted against the tax bill supported by Trump and most Republicans. But he isnt really right about Manchins positionon Gorsuch. You may not realize this, but as a nonprofit news organization,we depend on — and answer to — you. Your support directly impactsour abilility to provide objective reporting on issues that matter.Donate to our Spring Campaign. Go on the record as saying facts matter! Here, well look at Manchins actions on the Gorsuch nominations; we looked at his positions on Obamacare in a separate fact-check. Bottom line: When it counted, Manchin voted with Republicans to advance Gorsuchs nomination. Morriseys camp pointed to three votes on April 6, 2017, during the back-and-forth over Gorsuch when Manchin voted with most Democrats. In two cases, Manchin voted in favor of efforts by Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., to adjourn before voting on the Gorsuch nomination or to postpone it. (Both failed along party lines.) In the third vote, Manchin voted not to invoke the nuclear option, which is a procedural move to lower the number of votes required to advance to a final vote from 60 to a simple majority. In this case, too, Manchin voted with all Democrats and against all Republicans. However, citing only these three votes paints a misleading picture of Manchins actions. In the most important votes for securing Gorsuch a floor vote, Manchin sided with Gorsuch and Republicans — and hed telegraphed it. Before the final showdown began, Manchin on March 27, 2017, became the first Democratic senator to publicly break with others in his party and say hed side with Republicans by committing to vote in favor of proceeding to Gorsuchs nomination. By announcing his intention to support a vote for Gorsuch a full 10 days before the final action, he sent a signal to other Democrats who still might have been deciding on what to do. And Manchin stuck to his word: On April 6, Manchin was one of only four Democrats to vote to invoke cloture and proceed to a final vote on Gorsuchs nomination. After Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., successfully invoked the nuclear option, the Senate once again voted on cloture, this time needing only a simple majority. Once again, Manchin voted to proceed to Gorsuchs nomination on April 6, this time becoming one of only three Democrats to side with every Republican on the vote. Finally, on the actual vote on Gorsuchs nomination on April 7, Manchin voted in favor, once again making him one of just three Democrats to back Gorsuch in the final vote. Senate specialist Gregory Koger of the University of Miami said Manchin has the better argument than Morrisey in this case. Ordinarily I would place real weight on procedural votes, such as adjournment and on the nuclear option precedent, he said, but I think there were extenuating circumstances, at least on the precedent vote, and the early public support for Gorsuch more than compensates for these procedural votes. Morrisey said, If Joe Manchin had his way, Judge Gorsuch never would have been able to get a vote. Manchin did side with Democrats on certain procedural votes during the showdown over Gorsuch. But he broadcast his support for a vote on Gorsuch early enough to persuade fence-sitters, and on the main votes, he broke ranks with his party, siding with Republicans to secure Gorsuch a vote and ultimately confirm him to the court.",0.5,0.5,1,0.4,0,0.5,0.4,0.5,0.4,Half True

Final Rating: Mostly False  ","Says Bill Nelson sold agricultural land for home development, pocketing at least $1.4 million.","A hokey political commercialfrom the conservative super PAC American Crossroads lambasts Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson as a politician who has gotten out of paying property taxes.After 40 years in politics, Bill Nelson has learned how to milk the system. He leased land that he owned for six cows, taking advantage of an agricultural tax loophole to dodge $43,000 in taxes just last year, the narrator says. Then he sold the land for home development, pocketing at least $1.4 million.The kicker: Tax breaks and big profits for him, higher taxes for the rest of us. Here, we will look at whether he sold the land for home development for at least $1.4 million.The greenbelt exemptionAs evidence for the ad, Crossroads spokesman Nate Hodson referred us to a February 2012 Tampa Bay Timesstory that scrutinized Nelsons qualifications for a greenbelt assessment, which spares him from paying higher taxes on his familys 55-acre pasture along the Indian River. Instead of paying taxes on the market value, his tax bill is based on a much lower agricultural assessment.Nelson gets the greenbelt assessment for his Brevard County pasture because he leases the land to a small-time cattle owner. The current lessee, cattleman Jeff Darby, has a herd of about six cows and uses the land free of charge, though he is tasked with maintenance.The greenbelt law was enacted in 1959 as a financial incentive for farmers to keep their land as developers bought up farm land for malls, highways and homes.Without the lower agricultural rate, Nelson would have paid about $43,000 in higher taxes on the land.The ad gives voters the impression that Nelson parked some cows on land to save money on his taxes and then axed the cows in a land sale to developers. (The ad sends the cows flying with the arrival of a new brick house from the sky.)Such a move obviously goes against the spirit of the greenbelt law, though its legal, and it happens. The problem with the greenbelt law, critics say, is that its written too broadly. Under the law, county property appraisers are tasked with determining if the land is used primarily for bona fide agricultural purposes.The Brevard County property appraisers office has tried to remove Nelsons greenbelt designation in the past, but Nelson fought to keep it and won in court. (An inspector in 1999 went to his property and found no cows; Nelson argued they escaped via a hole in the fence.)Nelsons land salesThe ad leaves out a lot of important context about that $1.4 million profit that Nelson supposedly gained from land sales.When Nelson moved to Tallahassee in the mid 90s to serve on the state Cabinet, he sold the main house that he lived in, which is adjacent to the pasture.He sold four more nearby lots after he moved to Washington, D.C., to serve as a U.S. senator. Two of these were residential lots that had houses on them. Two more were lots that he cut out of his pastureland, so those had used the greenbelt exemption. The total for these four transactions to private homeowners is at least $1.4 million, the Times reported. Floridas greenbelt law does not require him to pay back part of his tax break.Nelsons campaign does not dispute the $1.4 million total -- they do dispute how American Crossroads presented the transactions. That total does not represent all of the money he received from the agricultural lots; it also includes the sales of two residential lots.The ad is leading viewers to equate the land that got the tax break with the land he sold for $1.4 million, and thats plainly wrong. Nelson did not sell the entire pasture. The cows still graze on it, and Nelson has indicated that will not change for the land his family has had since 1924.I've looked at all the options on the rest of the property and I've decided not to develop it. I want to leave it to my kids, Nelson told the Times in February.Our rulingIts not fully accurate for Crossroads to say Nelson took land that was receiving agricultural tax breaks and sold it for home development at a profit of $1.4 million. For one, the land that earned the tax break -- a 55-acre pasture -- is still a pasture. He did not sell that land for home development.Nelson has sold two agricultural lots, but those sales do not total $1.4 million. To get there, you have to factor in two more sales of residential lots adjoining the pasture. Those lots already had homes on them when Nelson sold them.American Crossroads is cherry-picking a figure from the Times story to incite anger against Nelsons tax break without telling the entire story.",0.2,0.8,0.9,0.5,0.3,0.7,0.6,0.9,0.4,Mostly False

Final Rating: Mostly False  ","Says Joe Biden said voting by mail is a way to fundamentally change this country, contradicting past statements by Barack Obama and Debbie Wasserman Schultz.","A new video launched by the Republican National Committee suggests Democrats are pushing a radical plan to change our elections through widespread mail-in voting. This is a radical change from their past, the video says. As evidence, it flashes to clips of comments by President Barack Obama, U.S. Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, D-Fla., and former U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder that are divorced from any context. The one-minute video plays snippets of journalists bashing Iowa Democrats over their bungled caucus in February before ending with a warning: Democrats couldnt run the Iowa Caucus. Dont let them redesign our entire election. The RNC launched its Protect the Vote website May 8, vowing to fight the Democrats assault on the integrity of our elections. But the clips of Democratic leaders are removed from the context of what they were talking about and ignore Obamas support for voting by mail in general at the time. The video also wrongly portrays the push for more mail-in voting as solely a Democratic effort. While Democratic leaders have pushed for more mail-in voting, they arent alone. Republican officeholders in at least 16 states that do not have all-mail elections were encouraging voters to cast ballots via mail. The RNCs former chairman in March called for conservatives to embrace broader use of voting by mail. RELATED: Donald Trumps dubious claim that 'thousands' are conspiring on mail-ballot fraud The ad starts with a clip of presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden stating, We have an incredible opportunity to not just dig out of this crisis but to fundamentally change this country. The text on the screen says, Democrats have a radical plan to change our elections. But Bidens statement was about protecting essential workers, not voting by mail or in person. He used a May 4 campaign event to talk about providing a livable wage and paid sick leave to workers including meat packers and grocery store clerks. Bidens campaign has said he wants safer options for voting, including voting by mail and in-person voting. At a virtual fundraiser in April, Biden told donors that we have to make it easier for everyone to vote if we are still in lockdown, including providing mail-in ballots. At a virtual fundraiser May 8, Biden praised a move by California Gov. Gavin Newsom to send a mail-in ballot to every voter. The video shows MSNBCs Chris Matthews asking Obama a question related to mail-in voting. They are talking about people mailing in their ballots. Do you trust the security, the honesty of such an election process? Matthews asked. Obama responded: Well, Id think we would have to figure out whether this was fraud-proof. The video doesnt clearly show the context of the interview; faint text on the screen says Decision 08. It would be possible for viewers to assume Obama was criticizing voting by mail in general, but Obama was commenting about a specific set of circumstances related to the presidential primary in Florida. In 2007, the Florida Legislature moved up the date of the presidential primary to Jan. 29, earlier than either national party permitted. Hillary Clinton beat Obama, but the Democratic National Committee determined that the election violated party rules and stripped the state of its delegates. In March 2008, some Florida Democrats proposed a do-over election including a scenario of entirely voting by mail. Here was Matthews full question on March 11, 2008, to then-Sen. Obama: Theres word from Florida that they intend to put out a mailing sort of a campaign — I mean, an election process, whereby they make up for the primary they had before, which was ruled out of order by the Democratic National Committee and you did not campaign in. Theyre talking about mailing it — people mailing in their ballots. Do you trust the security, the honesty of such an election process? The RNC video only included the first sentence of Obamas cautious response. But Obama then made some positive statements about voting by mail: I mean, Oregon, for example, has a terrific mail-in system, but theyve already scanned everybodys signatures whos registered to vote so that they can check to make sure that in fact the right people are voting. And thats something that I think youd have to figure out. During the 2020 pandemic, Obama has not expressly called for only voting by mail. He called for safe voting options while tweeting a New York Times story that debunked the claim that absentee voting favors Democrats and an NPR story about proposals to expand voting by mail and early voting. The clip in the video of Wasserman Schultz does not clearly show the context. The text on the screen reads postal primary do-over — but its difficult to decipher. Debbie Wasserman Schultz argues a mail-in ballot has wrong written all over it, a journalist says. The video then shows a clip of Wasserman Schultz, a Broward Democrat, stating: It would be a risky experiment for us with an election that has stakes as high as a presidential election does. The RNC video omits her next sentence: We've never done a mail-in ballot statewide. She also said that there's a way to solve this without totally redoing this and causing more chaos. Those clips are from a CNN report on March 10, 2008, about the idea for a mail-in primary do-over. Wasserman Schultz was talking about voting by mail in the narrow context of the proposed re-do election that spring. After months of wrangling that spring, the DNC agreed that Florida could send a full delegation to the convention, but each delegate would only get half a vote. Amid the pandemic, Wasserman Schultz said she supports expanding early voting and vote by mail options. The video also includes a quote by Eric Holder, a former Attorney General under Obama. No form of electoral fraud ever has been or will ever be tolerated by this administration, Holder said. That stems from a speech he gave about voting rights in 2012; he wasnt specifically talking about absentee ballot fraud. An RNC video says Joe Biden said voting by mail is a way to fundamentally change this country, contradicting past statements by Barack Obama and Debbie Wasserman Schultz. The RNC video only includes snippets of statements by Obama and Wasserman Schultz to leave viewers with a misleading impression that they were bashing voting by mail in general, and that wasnt the case. Obama and Wasserman Schultz were talking about voting by mail in a narrow set of circumstances: a controversial proposal to redo the presidential preference primary in Florida in 2008. There is no evidence that overall either Democrat was broadly critical of voting by mail as an option in elections. The portion of the video about Biden also omits context. The video quotes him stating we have an incredible opportunity to not just dig out of this crisis but to fundamentally change this country, before launching into the videos theme that Democrats want to use mail-in balloting to radically change American elections. But Biden wasnt talking about elections, he was talking about protecting workers amid the pandemic. This video includes actual quotes by these three Democrats, but lacks context to explain their remarks. This video rates Mostly False.

Final Rating: Mostly False  ",Small businesses in West Virginia make up about 96 percent of our state's economy.,"Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., recently cheerleaded West Virginia small businesses in a tweet from his Senate account. Manchin tweeted, Did you know #WV has more than 120k small businesses & they make up about 96% of our state's economy? Remember this & #shopsmall #WVSBDC #SBDCday Did you know #WV has more than 120k small businesses & they make up about 96% of our state's economy? Remember this & #shopsmall #WVSBDC #SBDCday We were surprised that small companies comprise 96 percent of West Virginias economy, so we took a closer look. As it turns out, Manchin used the wrong terminology, ultimately making his claim incorrect. We turned to data from the federal Small Business Administration, which offers fact sheets about small businesses in every state. Manchins in the ballpark for the number of small businesses in the state. The SBA counts 115,673 small businesses, a number that is apt to fluctuate regularly, as companies start up and go out of business. (The agencys definition of a small business is one with fewer than 500 employees.) And the fact sheet has a number close to the 96 percent figure Manchin cited. The SBA says that 98.9 percent of West Virginias businesses are small businesses. But that does not support what Manchin said. Saying that almost 99 percent of West Virginia's businesses are small firms is not what economists refer to as a percentage of the economy. That term refers to the percentage of all economic output, which is sometimes called state-level gross domestic product. The fact sheet doesnt provide small business output as a percentage of the economy, but its certainly well below 96 percent. Why? Because while small businesses account for nearly 99 percent of employers in the state, they only account for about half —50.1 percent — of West Virginia employees. So it isnot credible to say that half of the workforce produces 96 percent of the output while the other half — the big-company workforce —produces just 4 percent of output. In fact, it wouldnt be surprising if the half of West Virginia employees working for big companies account for more than half of economic output, said Gary Burtless, an economist with the Brookings Institution. In the nation as a whole, employees at smaller businesses tend to earn lower compensation than employees in larger businesses, probably indicating they are less productive, Burtless said. All these facts lead me to believe there is no possible way those 120,000 small businesses can account for 96 percent of the production or output of the West Virginia economy. Manchins office declined to comment for this article. Manchin said that small businesses in West Virginia make up about 96 percent of our state's economy. This appears to be a case of mistaken terminology. Small businesses do make up nearly 99 percent of the states employers, but only half of its employees. The way it is worded, Manchin's claim exaggerates the output of small businesses and underplays the economic influence of large companies in the state.",0.4,0.7,0.9,0.5,0.1,0.5,0.6,0.8,0.4,Mostly False

Final Rating: False  ","Hurricane Sandy, the most destructive Atlantic storm ever.","Hurricane Sandy is probably the worst storm to hit New Jersey after it killed 40 people, remade parts of the Shores coastline and caused damages in the tens of billions of dollars.But just how bad was it compared with other hurricanes?New Jersey can and must do more to slow global warming, especially after 2012's extreme weather and Hurricane Sandy, the most destructive Atlantic storm ever, Environment New Jersey said recently on its website.The most destructive Atlantic storm? Ever? Considering the magnitude of some other hurricanes in history, PolitiFact New Jersey decided to investigate. Doug OMalley, interim director for Environment New Jersey, said 'destructive' refers to the storm's financial damages. Data shows that while Sandy may be the worst storm to ever batter New Jersey and the tristate region, its not the most destructive Atlantic storm in history.Lets start with some background.Sandy slammed New Jersey on Oct. 29, leveling houses along the Shore and inland, and leaving millions without power for extended periods. The storm also unleashed a similar fury on New York and Connecticut.We checked Atlantic storms in the National Hurricane Centers data archives, which tracks storm costs through 2010. Hurricane Irene, which hit New Jersey in 2011, is not included.Leading the list is 2005s Hurricane Katrina, at $108 billion. Even though Katrina was largely a Gulf Coast storm, doing the most damage in Louisiana and Mississippi, it formed in the Atlantic and made landfall near Floridas Miami-Dade/Broward county line. It then moved across south Florida into the eastern Gulf of Mexico, according to Hurricane Center data.Katrina is still a clear runaway number one in terms of damages, said Dennis Eltgen, a spokesman at the Miami-based Hurricane Center.Second on the list is 1992s Hurricane Andrew, at $26.5 billion in damages. Andrew devastated parts of south Florida, continued into the Gulf of Mexico and turned north, hitting Louisiana.Those rankings change when damages are adjusted for 2010 dollars.In that case, the Great Miami Hurricane of 1926 that hit southeast Florida and Alabama ranks first, at $164.8 billion; Katrina second, at $113 billion; and Andrew fifth, at $58.5 billion.Sandy, however, is different than many hurricanes that often swing through the Gulf of Mexico.I dont think we were trying to claim that Sandy was more destructive than Katrina, OMalley said. We were trying to say Sandy was the worst hurricane to fully hit the Eastern Seaboard. That being said, Katrina did obviously really hit New Orleans but clearly, it tailed over Florida. We were counting Katrina as only hitting the Gulf Coast. We trust the National Hurricane Center. If they say its both, we agree with that.The governors of New Jersey, New York and Connecticut have estimated Sandys damages at $82 billion. President Obama has requested $60 billion in federal aid for the three states. The Senate approved the request and the House passed a $9 billion aid package Friday, and additional aid is expected to pass on Jan. 15.In making the aid request for the White House, Jeffrey D. Zients, deputy director for Management for the Office of Management and Budget, described Sandys place in hurricane history in a letter to House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio).All told, although estimates of the total damage of Hurricane Sandy remain in flux, current projections are that Sandy is on track to be the second or third most costly natural disaster in U.S, history, behind Hurricane Katrina (2005) and close to Hurricane Andrew (1992), Zients wrote.Our rulingEnvironment New Jersey claimed that Octobers Hurricane Sandy is the most destructive Atlantic storm, ever.Sandy may be the most destructive storm to hit a part of the Eastern Seaboard but in terms of most destructive Atlantic storms, that title goes to Katrina, which formed in the Atlantic and whose damages topped $100 billion, according to Hurricane Center data. Sandy, however, is very high on the list, with damages totaling at least $82 billion. Still, thats not number one in todays dollars or compared with storms adjusted for inflation in 2010.

Final Rating: Mostly False","In sanctuary cities, local officials order police to release dangerous criminal aliens to prey upon the public instead of handing them over to ICE to be safely removed.","During the 2020 State of the Union address, President Donald Trump slammed sanctuary cities for their limited cooperation with Immigration and Customs Enforcement. In sanctuary cities, local officials order police to release dangerous criminal aliens to prey upon the public instead of handing them over to ICE to be safely removed, he said. Trump cited an incident in which an undocumented immigrant released from custody allegedly assaulted and killed a 92-year-old woman in New York City. Trump also spotlighted the brother of a man killed in a crime spree by an undocumented immigrant released in California. The United States of America should be a sanctuary for law-abiding Americans, not criminal aliens, he said, calling on Congress to pass a bill to let victims sue sanctuary cities. Theres no federal definition for a sanctuary city, and the details vary from place to place. But broadly speaking, the term refers to any jurisdiction that refuses to continue holding people in local jails beyond their jail or prison sentence solely because ICE has asked the jurisdiction to do so. (ICEs request is formally known as a detainer.) The individual cases Trump addressed were documented in media reports, and the White House has published a list of other criminal noncitizens shielded from ICE officials. But Trumps claim that local officials order police to release dangerous criminal aliens makes setting criminals free sounds like standard operating procedure. As we detailed while fact-checking a similar claim in 2018, thats not the case. Even sanctuary cities typically turn over to ICE many of the felons Trump warns about. The White House and Trump campaign did not respond to requests for comment. ICE news releases report numerous instances of ignored detainer requests that result in undocumented immigrants being set free and later arrested by ICE. According to ICEs report for the 2019 fiscal year, 86% of the roughly 143,000 noncitizens arrested by ICE had criminal convictions or pending charges. Its unclear how many were arrested after being released in sanctuary cities. The report says ICE issued 165,487 detainers to law enforcement officials, and that a number of aliens who have been released under these circumstances have gone on to commit additional crimes. Some insight came during an October Senate hearing, when ICE official Timothy Robbins said the agency brought roughly 1,300 noncitizens into custody over the span of a few weeks, including large numbers of people who had been released in sanctuary cities. Robbins said three of those 1,300 people had prior convictions for manslaughter or murder, 100 had convictions for sexual assault or related crimes, 70 had convictions for drug-related crimes, and 320 had convictions for driving under the influence. Almost 200 of the aliens arrested during the most recent operation could have been taken into custody at local jails if the detainer had been honored, Robbins said. Robbins did not say whether any of the 200 people ICE targeted with detainers went on to commit further crimes or, in Trumps words, prey on Americans. Sanctuary policies across the country treat dangerous criminals differently, but experts told us many have specific ways of dealing with them. A number of the sanctuary policies have carve-outs for individuals with certain types of felony offenses, and some non-felony offenses, Annie Lai, clinical professor of law at the University of California Irvine, told us. You want to see if the policy allows for detention for ICE, notification to ICE, transfer to ICE or transfer only with a warrant. Each of these mean different things. Californias sanctuary law, for example, gives law enforcement officials leeway to hold someone for ICE if theyve committed one of a number of crimes. The list includes gang-related offenses, assault, battery, sexual abuse and exploitation, rape, crimes endangering children, burglary, robbery, theft, fraud, forgery, any crime resulting in death, some domestic violence offenses, and drug and weapon-related offenses. In New York City, people convicted of one or more of 177 types of felonies within the last five years can be handed over to ICE authorities, but only if those authorities secure a warrant first. Michelle Mittelstadt, director of communications at the Migration Policy Institute, told us shes unaware of a jurisdiction that releases dangerous criminal aliens as a matter of policy. Where jurisdictions have set limits on their cooperation with ICE typically revolve around the issue of whether the agency is seeking transfer of a noncitizen who has been booked or charged versus an offender who is completing a criminal sentence, as well as whether ICE needs to seek a court order for the request to detain a noncitizen, she added. Mittelstadt explained that when noncitizens are released in sanctuary cities, the criminal justice process has taken place or is taking place as it would in the case of anyone else. When state and local prisons release noncitizens without transfer to ICE, the person has completed their criminal sentence, has been released without charge, or has been charged and released on bond pending further action in the criminal justice system, she said. The New York City murder suspect Trump mentioned had originally been arrested for attacking his father with a broken coffee cup and arraigned on charges of assault and criminal possession of a weapon before he was released pending trial, according to reports. He had not yet been convicted on those charges by the time of the alleged murder. Meanwhile, the California man who went on a crime spree in 2018 had previously been convicted of armed robbery. But the charge was 15 years old, meaning local police couldnt use it to justify holding him for ICE, according to the Washington Post. He had been deported twice before, in 2004 and 2014, and was arrested in 2018 after a caller reported erratic behavior. He tested positive for use of a controlled substance, but because that offense only carried a misdemeanor charge, he was released after 10 hours in custody. Mike Boudreaux, the county sheriff on the case, blamed Californias sanctuary law for keeping his officers from coordinating with ICE authorities. That tool has been removed from our hands, he said, according to the Washington Post. And because of that, our county was shot up by a violent criminal. Trump said, In sanctuary cities, local officials order police to release dangerous criminal aliens to prey upon the public instead of handing them over to ICE to be safely removed. Sanctuary policies dont mean that undocumented criminals get to walk free of charges, or that local officials order police to release them as standard operating procedure. Noncitizens facing arrest still go through the criminal justice system; sanctuary policies mean that they arent turned over to ICE authorities after theyve done so. Still, many sanctuary policies include specific provisions allowing law enforcement to comply with ICEs requests when it comes to noncitizens who have been convicted of felonies. Thats the case in both California and New York City — the two places Trump called out by name. Media reports and ICE press releases have documented some cases in which noncitizens with serious criminal records were released by police in spite of detainer requests. But these individuals had already gone through the criminal justice system in one way or another.",0.3,0.8,0.7,0.4,0.6,0.9,0.5,0.5,0.3,Mostly False

Final Rating: Mostly False  ",Says opponent Mary Burke told reporters she would have required workers to give up bargained-for healthcare and retirement benefits like Gov. Walker.,"Democrat Brett Hulsey says that any union member who supports Mary Burke is like a chicken who votes for Colonel Sanders. Thems fightin words -- and theyre aimed at a fellow Democrat vying to take on Republican Gov. Scott Walker in the November election. Hulsey, a state representative from Madison and former vice president of a union local at a Sierra Club office, alleges outsourcing of jobs by Trek Bicycle when Burke was a Trek board member. Hulsey is also displeased with Burkes support of a charter school in Madison, where she is on the school board. But what really miffs Hulsey is Burke saying it was reasonable and fair for public employees to pay more toward their state-funded pensions and health insurance in 2011. In his controversial move to sharply limit collective bargaining, Walker and fellow Republicans imposed those cost-sharing moves on state employees and cleared the way for local governments to do the same. It was part of the law known as Act 10. Hulsey is accusing Burke of Walker-like anti-union behavior regarding those benefits and other issues. She supports taking public servants healthcare and retirement benefits, Hulsey claimed in a May 21, 2014 news release. And in a letter to Burke in advance of the South Central Federation of Labors annual bean feed, a long-running celebration sponsored by the Madison-based labor union umbrella group, Hulsey wrote: You told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel that you would have required workers to give up bargained for healthcare and retirement benefits like Gov. Walker. Is Hulsey right? Burkes statements on Act 10 Burke, who entered the governors race in early October 2013, has been remarkably consistent in her comments on Act 10. As support for his claim, Hulsey cites an April 18, 2014 interview with the Journal Sentinel in which Burke said she would work to restore collective bargaining for public workers while still seeking efficient government. In the interview, Burke said: If I had been governor I would have made sure I bargained for the changes that needed to be made to balance the state budget. I think it was only fair to ask for contributions to health care and pensions but I think those could have been negotiated, certainly firmly but fairly. Walkers approach, she said, left the state divided and has caused teachers and prospective educators to question whether salaries and benefits will be sufficient to support their careers and pay off student loans. Wisconsin walked away from the table and left it in a worse place, Burke said. So, Burke staked out a somewhat nuanced position. She defended getting public workers to pay more. She said shed have negotiated over the pension and health changes, in contrast to Walkers approach of removing those as subjects of bargaining. And she suggested she could have achieved a result similar to Walkers by being firm in her ask for the benefits changes. Could she have? Thats debatable. In 2011, some union leaders at one point said theyd agree to the benefits givebacks. But that was under extreme pressure because Walker had the votes for the stringent limits on bargaining -- and a ban on employers from deducting union dues from employee paychecks. In any event, its clear from Burkes comments that she wanted a similar result on pension and healthcare cost-sharing as Walker, but wouldnt -- and couldnt -- have required workers to pay more. Thats because, she said, shed have negotiated to try to get that. But her comments also suggest she would have made a high priority of getting those fair givebacks in exchange for something else. Burkes comments have been met with disappointment from some quarters on the left and among union leaders, but shes received endorsements from the largest state employee union, major teachers unions and the state AFL-CIO. They said her support is clear for collective bargaining, which she described as something that I believe in and think is right for our state, in an appearance on The Devils Advocates radio show. Meanwhile, Hulsey is making a full-throated pledge to try to repeal Act 10 as a whole, including the benefits cuts, saying the cuts were not necessary. He has pledged to provide back pay to workers whose wages declined because of the act. Hulsey told us that Burkes comments -- that she would have negotiated the benefits changes she needed -- amount to an approach that would have required the cuts of workers, just in a more humane way than Walker. Our rating Hulsey claimed Burke told Journal Sentinel reporters and editors that she would have required workers to give up bargained-for healthcare and retirement benefits like Gov. Walker. Theres an element of truth here in that Burke did say she backed benefits cuts in the same areas as Walker got, and was confident she could have achieved them. But Hulseys phrasing makes it sound like Burke backs Walkers approach. Thats a huge stretch given that she would have left collective bargaining intact and tried to negotiate the cost-cutting moves.",0.7,0.6,0.9,0.5,0.4,0.5,0.4,0.8,0.6,Mostly False

Final Rating: Half True  ",Every dollar of foreign aid for agricultural research will bring $4 in trade with the countries and the United States ... generating employment back in the U.S.,"While the details are vague, foreign aid is on the chopping block in President Donald Trumps pending budget. Non-military assistance accounts for less than 1 percent of federal spending and defenders of aid would like to argue that it actually pays dividends to America. Shenggen Fan, the head of the International Food Policy Research Institute, a widely respected organization, said his group had a study showing very specific paybacks tied to aid. If we help the countries developing to invest in agriculture research, every $1 invested will bring $4 (in) trade with the countries and the United States, Fan said Feb. 2 at a meeting in Washington. So if you're investing in foreign aid, youre generating employment back in the U.S. It helps economic growth here in this country. Fans office said he was referring to a 1996 article that described a sort of domino effect. Agricultural research leads to higher production, which in turn delivers economic growth and the extra income generates demand for more imports. When the flow of additional imports over time is taken into account, the $1 investment in agricultural research generates $4.39 of additional imports, the article said. That seems to back up Fans point, but it terms of what it means for sales by American companies, he pushed the findings a little too far. The article specifically noted that theres no guarantee that a particular donor country captures the gains from the increase in exports. Put another way, an investment of $1 might spur $4 in trade, but theres no guarantee the original investor will be the one to benefit. Fan posted an item later that dialed back on the trade gains, writing that they would help economies like the United States or Germany. In addition, that study is 20 years old, and we could find no other study that reached the same conclusion. Fans office cited a 2006 analysis from the Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research. The center wanted to gauge the economic impact of the work it funded. It did find that research boosted trade, but for a number of reasons, that result didnt do much to bolster Fans case. In the first case, the Australians defined trade gains broadly to include increased sales by Aussie firms to developed countries such as Japan. On top of that, they didnt find a 4-to-1 payback on trade. When we crunched their numbers, it was more like 1-to-1. The authors also warned that their dollar amounts were based on projected rather than actual benefits. It is possible that these benefits never actually emerged or that the benefits that did emerge were considerably greater, they wrote. We asked a number of researchers if they knew of any study that linked foreign aid for agricultural research to greater exports for American firms. Not one could think of such work. We are not aware of other quantitative estimates of a relationship between investment in agriculture in foreign countries and trade, Cheryl Christensen of the USDAs Economic Research Service told us. The consensus that emerged was that the domino effect Fan had in mind might take place in some countries, but no analysis had pulled all the pieces together. I believe that our foreign aid to agriculture is effective and can boost agricultural production and rural income in developing countries, Phillip Abbott, professor of agricultural economics at Purdue University, told us. As countries grow, they may well -- many do -- need more food than they can produce themselves, and this leads to greater imports, including agriculture imports from U.S. agriculture. Turning this into a causal chain with a fixed multiplier, as claimed by Fan, is a stretch. Robert Paarlberg at Harvard Universitys Kennedy School said plenty of research ties aid to greater productivity and rising incomes. But it starts to become difficult when you look for links back to foreign aid, especially agricultural development aid, Paarlberg said. There the links remain plausible, at least in countries capable of using aid well, but they become too remote to estimate with any confidence. Our ruling Fan said every dollar of foreign aid for agricultural research will bring $4 in trade with the countries and the United States ... generating employment back in the U.S. A 1996 article supports most of that assertion except for the part about all the trade being with the United States. However, that article is 20 years old and we could find no other study that mirrored its findings. The leading agricultural researchers we reached told us that in some countries, that general result might come about, but it varies from place to place and it is difficult to show the connection to foreign aid in the agricultural research sector. So Fan went too far on three points: the 4-to-1 payback, the amount of trade with the United States and the idea that this general rule applies to most countries when it is actually less predictable.",0.5,0.5,1,0.5,0,0.5,0.5,1,0.5,Half True

Final Rating: Half True  ",Stimulus dollars paid for windmills from China.,"In the 2010 mid-term elections, Republicans won a lot of seats by running against government spending and especially the stimulus. The Romney campaign revived that theme in an ad that asks Where did all the money go?The answer in the ad is not subtle. Image after image of dollar bills go up in flames. So where did the Obama stimulus money go? Windmills from China, the ad says. It also mentions cars from Finland, which we dealt with in a separate fact-check. For this one, well focus on whether stimulus money paid for windmills from China.Windmills from China have something of a history when it comes to political messaging. PolitiFact looked into Sarah Palins claim that nearly all of the renewable energy stimulus dollars went to Chinese turbine makers. A version came up again this year in the Ohio federal Senate race. PolitiFact found that the Republican making the charge believed that a large wind project in Texas would have purchased 300 Chinese turbines. In fact, that project never got off the ground.The concern over foreign beneficiaries of taxpayer money is not exclusively Republican territory. Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., has raised a stir about the fraction of money for renewable energy going to foreign businesses.The Romney campaign sent us supporting documents for the ads claim. Among the reports and articles they cite, one refers to that massive project in Texas that was never built and will never receive stimulus money. Others stem from the Investigative Reporting Workshop, a nonprofit journalism project at American University.The Investigative Reporting Workshops report backs up the ads claim but paints a murkier picture than the Romney campaign would have you think. The author tallied $2.6 million in stimulus money going to Chinese makers of wind turbines. However, the reporter, Russ Choma, also says that none of the farms used turbines entirely built in China. Additionally, he couldnt say for sure how much stimulus money made its way to China. Some money definitely did, but it is safe to say more money went to creating jobs in the U.S. and Europe, he wrote.A Challenging Money TrailFederal support for renewable energy projects came through the 1603 tax credit program. So far, this program has paid out about $5.2 billion to wind farms nationwide. Once a project is on line and delivering power, that program pays money to the project developer -- as much as 30 percent of the project cost. Along the way, the developer pays the companies that provided the materials. Following the money becomes complicated because wind turbines are about as intricate as airplanes.To choose an example, lets look at a wind farm going up in Alaska. The lead contractor is General Electric, the worlds third-largest supplier of wind turbines and an American firm. But according to the Anchorage Daily News, The blades are made in Brazil, the units that contain the generator come from Southern California, the connecting hubs from the Florida Panhandle and the towers are made in China.This $65 million project isnt eligible for the 1603 money until it begins producing power. When it does, it could receive as much as $20 million from Washington. More detailed information would be needed to assign those funds to the manufacturers.We called the American Wind Energy Association, an industry trade group, to see if they knew of any Chinese turbines paid for with American stimulus dollars. They said they did. Their best guess is the number is six -- five in Texas and one in Iowa. But that might not be exactly right, said Liz Salerno, director of industry data and analysis. Because some of the blades and towers in Texas might have come from American firms.If it is six, that represents a tiny fraction of all the turbines installed with stimulus dollars. Salerno says the program funded more than 12,000 turbine installations over three years. Chinese components might have shown up in various places, but if one is counting complete Chinese windmills, then they account for less than 1 percent of the total.Elsewhere, we have reported that due to the limited size of the American wind energy industry, most of the stimulus money to expand wind power went to foreign companies or their American-based subsidiaries. That does not mean that every dollar left the country. Some foreign companies built manufacturing plants in the U.S., for example.That created jobs for American workers. The U.S. Energy Department estimates that the 1603 program went to projects that involved between 95,000 and 155,000 jobs. Those estimates cover all kinds of renewable energy generation work, but wind projects got over 80 percent of the funds. Manufacturing jobs in the wind industry began growing in 2005, and that trend continued through 2011. They now number about 30,000, according to the American Wind Energy Association. Our rulingMitt Romneys ad said that stimulus dollars paid for windmills from China.By depicting dollars going up in flames, the ad suggests that the U.S. gained nothing from the stimulus spending, and the money largely went to countries such as China.In reality, many American firms connected to the wind industry expanded during the years of the stimulus. Only a small fraction of the money spent on wind energy went to China.This statement contains a grain of truth but ignores other information.",0.5,0.5,1,0.5,0,0.5,0.5,1,0.5,Half True

Final Rating: Mostly False",The Democrats filibustered the legislation that wouldve resulted in this shooter being in federal prison instead of murdering those innocents in that Texas church.,"Reacting to the church shootings in Sutherland Springs, Texas, Sen. Ted Cruz said there could have been laws on the books to prevent what happened, had his opponents in Congress not defeated his proposal a few years ago. The Democrats filibustered the legislation that wouldve resulted in this shooter being in federal prison instead of murdering those innocents in that Texas church, Cruz said on Fox News on Nov. 6. Cruz, a Republican,is talking about a failed amendment he co-sponsored to curtail an expansion of background checks and increase prosecution of people who lied about their criminal histories to obtain firearms. He has a point that the Democrats didnt back it, but he fails to mention that every amendment on the 2013 gun control bill faced the same hurdle, and a Democratic one also fell short. While Democrats defeated his proposal, experts said it would not have made the crucial difference in this massacre for a couple of reasons. The Texas church shooter was discharged from the Air Force for bad conduct after he was court-martialed in 2012 for assaulting his wife and fracturing his stepson's skull. Federal law prohibited him from buying or possessing firearms after this conviction, but he got past the background check system because the Air Force failed to enter the shooters felony into the background check database. So when he purchased two guns at the San Antonio gun shop Academy Sports + Outdoors, both sales were approved by the National Instant Criminal Background Check System. When we asked Cruzs office for details, they softened what Cruz originally said, saying his legislation would have increased the chances of preventing the Air Force error that led to the failure to submit the relevant information to NICS. The amendment pushed for clearer guidance on submissions of federal records to the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (mandated by NICS Improvement Amendments Act of 2007) and required that federal agencies submit plans for making the information available. The only possible contribution may have been that the reporting requirement to the AG might have led the Defense Department and the Air Force to realize that the procedures they had in place needed enhancement, said Geoffrey Corn, a law professor at South Texas College of Law Houston. But the language was a near replica of President Barack Obamas Jan. 16, 2013 memorandum to the Justice Department, which officials were already trying to implement. Molly Moran, who served as the Principal Deputy Associate Attorney General from 2014 to 2016, said she and her colleagues at the Justice Department worked from 2013 until the end of Obamas second term in implementing the memo. It made no difference in the Texas church shooting. The Air Force needed to submit the shooters 2012 court-martial, and it failed to do so. Cruz said on Fox that a lack of reporting of federal and state records to the background check system was a problem. But his legislation did not seem to make this easier. The amendment eliminated sanctions for states that failed to submit records and lowered the cap on grant money to help states submit them from $100 million to $20 million. The original bill from then-Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., would have expanded background checks on purchases from only federally licensed gun dealers to all transfers, even private ones among family members, with few exceptions. But the Grassley-Cruz amendment chucked the expansion of background checks and even allowed for the interstate sale and transportation of firearms. If anything, the only way this would have affected the Texas shooting would be to make it easier for the shooter to attack a church in a neighboring state instead, said Gregory Koger, a political science professor at the University of Miami. Cruz also summoned a familiar talking point against gun regulation that few background check lies (where felons say they are not felons) are prosecuted. His amendment created a task force to increase these prosecutions, but it did not mandate that the Justice Department prosecute all of them. Enhanced prosecution efforts still would not have put the shooter behind bars. Without the court-martial in the database, the shooter would still have passed the background check after marking that he was not a felon. He could have been prosecuted had his lie been known by prosecutors, but they had no reason to investigate this until after the shooting, said Adam Winkler, a law professor at University of California, Los Angeles. Reid set a 60-vote threshold on all amendments to his Safe Communities, Safe Schools Act of 2013 to prevent a situation in which the amendment passed by a bare majority and then was filibustered — by the Republican minority. Cruzs amendment failed 52-48, with nine Democrats voting for it and two Republicans voting against (Mark Kirk of Illinois and Mike Lee of Utah). So did the bipartisan Toomey-Manchin background check amendment favored by Democrats, which got 54 votes. Experts said it was fair to call this a filibuster, though Reid attained the Senate's unanimous consent for the 60-vote threshold. The notion that the Democrats are responsible for the failure of this proposal ignores the fact that the GOP was filibustering the underlying bill, which had all the same provisions except the state-to-state expansion of gun rights and a requirement to expand background checks, Koger said. Cruz said, The Democrats filibustered the legislation that wouldve resulted in this shooter being in federal prison. The amendment Cruz cosponsored, which was defeated largely by Democrats after failing to reach a 60-vote threshold, strengthened efforts to prosecute people who lied about their criminal histories to obtain firearms. But the shooter in this case wouldnt have showed up as having lied because of the Air Forces failure to report his felony. The Cruz proposal also aimed to facilitate reporting to the instant background check system with guidelines and deadlines for federal agencies, including the armed services. While similar action by the Obama Justice Department around the same time didnt help, Cruzs clarifications becoming law may have. But its impossible to say with any certainty.",0.5,0.7,0.9,0.6,0.8,0.7,0.5,1.0,0.4,Mostly False

Final Rating: Half True  ",Barack Obama is more to the left of the announced Socialist in the United States Senate.,"It's an old standby of GOP presidential politics to paint Democratic opponents as liberals who are out of step with the American mainstream. Sen. John McCain took up that line of attack against Sen. Barack Obama this month in an interview with theKansas City Star. Obama is more to the left of the announced Socialist in the United States Senate, Bernie Sanders of Vermont, McCain said when asked if he really thought Obama was an extremist. In truth, this is a recycled charge, one thatPolitiFact examined before.But since the charge lives, we'll take it on again. McCain's source is a vote rankings study put out each year byNational Journal,a respected, nonpartisan, inside-the-beltway weekly magazine. In January 2008, after analyzing 99 of the 442 votes taken by the Senate in 2007,National Journalreported that Obama was the most liberal of the bunch. Sanders finished fourth. The two differed on just three of the 99 votes the magazine studied. According toNational Journal,the three votes occurred in January, March and June of 2007. In January, Sanders joined a conservative majority in voting against establishing a Senate Office of Public Integrity to handle ethics complaints against senators. Obama voted for it. Likewise, Sanders was with a conservative majority in June when he voted against moving forward with a comprehensive immigration reform bill. Again, Obama voted for it. But in March, it was Obama siding with a conservative majority in voting for a resolution stating that funds for U.S. troops in the field should not be cut off. Sanders voted with liberals against the resolution. So, as far as that one study goes, Obama was more liberal than Sanders in 2007 by a net difference of one vote. But the magazine's tally is inherently subjective, since it relies on the judgment of its editors and reporters to determine which votes show an ideological distinction. And the sample size of votes comparing Obama to Sanders is quite small. Sanders only joined the Senate in 2007, Obama in 2005. And Obama wasn't the most liberal senator in either of his first two years, finishing 16th-most liberal in 2005, according toNational Journal,and 10th-most liberal in 2006. And as PolitiFact found earlier this year, other tallies disagree withNational Journal'sfindings. Voteview.com, which conducts a similar study based on the judgments of political scientists, found that eight current senators, including Vermont's Sanders, were more liberal than Obama. The Voteview.com study looked at the breadth of the senators' careers, not just the most recent year. Likewise, Americans for Democratic Action, a self-described liberal group, found that Obama needs to get a lot more liberal to match up with Sanders. In tallying votes it believed showed a liberal position, the group reported in February that Obama scored only a 75 percent liberal quotient in 2007, while Sanders clocked in at 95 percent. Obama might have scored as well as Sanders if he hadn't missed five of the 20 votes the ADA scored. Missed votes are counted against senators in the study. Sanders, by contrast, voted with the ADA on 19 of the 20 votes the group tallied. Another method of evaluating senators' politics is used byCongressional Quarterly,which gauges how often they vote with members of their own party on bills that divide most Republicans from most Democrats. In that tally, both Obama and Sanders sided with the Democrats on 97 percent of partisan votes in 2007. Even Charles Green,National Journal'seditor, says he'd be wary of putting too much stock in any one rating methodology. There's pluses and minuses to each rating system. If you look at a number of them, I think you have a pretty good picture, he told PolitiFact in June. So while McCain can make a case that Obama was more liberal than Sanders in 2007, that conclusion is more a matter of opinion than fact. As a result, we find his statement Barely True.

Final Rating: Half True  ",I argued for years that we need to move from a 'Musharraf policy' to a 'Pakistan policy.' ,"For years, the U.S. government has had an uneasy relationship with Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf. While there was discomfort with Musharraf's dictatorial ways, he was also seen as a key ally in fighting al-Qaida, a moving target between Afghanistan and parts of Pakistan. Musharraf resigned on Aug. 18, 2008, rather than face imminent impeachment proceedings, and two days later Sen. Barack Obama issued a bit of an I-told-you-so. I argued for years that we need to move from a 'Musharraf policy' to a 'Pakistan policy,' Obama said in a speech before the Veterans of Foreign Wars National Convention on Aug. 19. We must move beyond an alliance built on mere convenience or a relationship with one man. Now, with President Musharraf's resignation, we have the opportunity to do just that. That's why I've co-sponsored a bill to triple nonmilitary aid to the Pakistani people, while ensuring that the military assistance we do provide is used to take the fight to the Taliban and al-Qaida in the tribal regions of Pakistan. The question here is whether Obama inflated his foresight on Musharraf in an effort to bolster his credibility on foreign policy. What did he say and when did he say it? The Obama campaign provided a handful of citations. In July, Obama said on CNN'sLarry King Live:In order for us to be effective in dealing with the resurgence of al-Qaida and the Taliban as they use Pakistan — the northwest provinces — as a sanctuary, we've got to have a stronger relationship with the Pakistani government — the new Pakistani government. We had put all our eggs in the Musharraf basket. And then there's this from Obama, inNewsweek,in April: There is a sizable middle class [in Pakistan] that believes in rule of law and believes in a government that is accountable to the people. So our willingness to put all our eggs in the Musharraf basket without understanding this other tradition, and without understanding that our choice in a place like Pakistan is not simply [between] military dictatorship or Islamic rule, led us to make a series of miscalculations that has weakened our fight against terrorism in the region. And in March, Obama in theWashinton Post:In Pakistan, I will reject the false choice between stability and democracy. In our unconditional support for Musharraf, we have gotten neither. And in February, at a Democratic debate: I've said very clearly that we have put all our eggs in the Musharraf basket. That was a mistake. We should be going after al-Qaida and making sure that Pakistan is serious about hunting down terrorists, as well as expanding democracy. Last November, Obama helped lead a Senate resolution that condemned Musharraf for invoking a state of emergency; and called on Musharraf to relinquish his position as chief of army staff of Pakistan and to allow for free and fair elections. That clearly puts Obama on record in the past year. I believe Obama is correct in stating that he has wanted to move past a Musharraf-centric strategy in Pakistan for some time now, said Daniel Markey, a senior fellow for India, Pakistan and South Asia at the nonpartisan Council on Foreign Relations. To some extent, this shows genuine foresight, but it is important to note that Obama was not alone in this view, Markey told PolitiFact. In fact, many people outside the Bush administration have been saying this — or something similar — since shortly after 9/11. It has been the common refrain of many think tankers, and of course it has been reiterated by Pakistani opposition leaders (from Benazir Bhutto down) who were excluded from power by Musharraf. The question here is whether Obama's position is one he has advocated for years. Last August, Obama made headlines when he said during a speech in Washington, If we have actionable intelligence about high-value terrorist targets (in Pakistan) and President Musharraf won't act, we will. Sen. John McCain later called that statement naive and said, You don't broadcast that you are going to bomb a country that is a sovereign nation and that you are dependent on the good will of the people of that country to help you in the war — in the struggle against Taliban and the sanctuaries which they hold. One could argue that Obama's vow to act independently against terrorist cells in Pakistan, if Musharraf wouldn't, amounted to advocacy for moving from a Musharraf policy to a Pakistan policy. And that would put him on record a year ago. But by way of rebuttal, the McCain campaign provided this Obama nugget from an MSNBC Democratic presidential debate on Aug. 7, 2007 (just days after Obama's if-Musharraf-won't-we-will line): I did not say that we would immediately go in (to Pakistan) unilaterally. What I said was that we have to work with Musharraf, because the biggest threat to American security right now are in the northwest provinces of Pakistan and that we should continue to give him military aid contingent on him doing something about that. So even Obama, at this point, was talking about still trying to work with Musharraf. Part of our conundrum here is that in the course of 24 hours, Obama changed the timeline on his claim of advocating the United States move from a 'Musharraf policy' to a 'Pakistan policy' — first stating that he advocated it a year ago and then ratcheting it up a day later, saying he had argued it for years. We checked the congressional record and couldn't find any statements from the floor or in the text of any legislation that Obama co-sponsored that suggests this was a years-old position. If Obama had said he has been advocating this position for months, he'd be on solid footing. And he rightly gets credit for some foresight on the issue. But when he says it's a position he has argued for years he is giving himself more credit than even his campaign can confirm. ",0.5,0.6,0.9,0.5,0.2,0.4,0.5,0.6,0.4,Half True

Final Rating: Half True  ",Alopecia isn't a medical disease; it's an aesthetic one.,"A medical condition that causes hair loss sprang into the spotlight after the March 27 Academy Awards, when comedian Chris Rock made a joke about the shaved head of actress Jada Pinkett Smith. After Rocks joke, actor Will Smith, Pinkett Smiths husband, walked onstage and slapped him. Soon after, some social media users expressed skepticism that the hair loss is due to an illness. Alopecia isn't a medical disease; it's an aesthetic one, read a March 28 post on Facebook. The post was flagged as part of Facebooks efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The term alopecia broadly refers to hair loss from any cause, including normal aging, according to the Mayo Clinic. Some types of alopecia, such as alopecia areata, are an autoimmune disease, a type of illness that occurs when the immune system mistakenly attacks part of the body, according to the American Academy of Dermatology Association. Pinkett Smith has alopecia areata. Its unclear whether Rock knew about Pinkett Smiths condition, the Associated Press reported. Alopecia areata is a disease that occurs when the bodys immune system attacks hair follicles, often on the scalp or face, but sometimes on other parts of the body, the AP reported. Sometimes hair falls out in chunks and only partial baldness results. Sometimes hair grows back but repeated bouts of baldness can also occur. It is not life-threatening, but there is no cure. The statement that alopecia isn't a medical disease contains an element of truth — the term alopecia broadly refers to hair loss from any cause, including normal aging. But the claim ignores critical facts: Some types of alopecia are an autoimmune disease. ",0.5,0.7,0.9,0.4,0.1,0.6,0.5,1.0,0.5,Half True

Final Rating: Half True  ",Late changes to the Arizona immigration law lay to rest questions over the possibility of racial profiling.,"The controversy over a hard-line immigration law signed by Republican Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer on April 23, 2010, shows no signs of ebbing, despite a last-minute change to the law's language designed to placate some of the laws' critics.Generally speaking, the law, which would go into effect in 90 days, makes being an illegal immigrant a state crime and requires legal immigrants to carry papers that confirm their legal status.One of the key questions to emerge during and after its passage has been what standard law enforcement officers will need to use before questioning individuals about their immigration status. Drawing special attention is the role played by racial profiling -- that is, the use of racial or ethnic characteristics as a justification for police questioning.Critics had said that the original version of the law permitted racial profiling. But the changes signed by Brewer on April 30 were intended to blunt those charges.The new version of the law says: A law enforcement official or agency of this state or a county, city, town or other political subdivision of this state may not consider race, color or national origin in implementing the requirements of this subsection except to the extent permitted by the United States or Arizona Constitution.The prior version had said that an official may not solely consider race in such circumstances.The change appears to limit the scope of the law. The previous wording left open the possibility that race could be used as a factor -- just not the sole factor -- in deciding to stop someone.In a news release issued after signing the changes to the law, Brewer said, These changes specifically answer legal questions raised by some who expressed fears that the original law would somehow allow or lead to racial profiling. These new amendments make it crystal clear and undeniable that racial profiling is illegal, and will not be tolerated in Arizona. I am proud that the Arizona Legislature has listened carefully to everyones concerns, and, in a gesture of statesmanship, acted swiftly and appropriately to lay to rest questions over the possibility of racial profiling.We wanted to judge the accuracy of Brewer's statement that the new wording will lay to rest questions over the possibility of racial profiling.This is our second attempt in a week to analyze the Arizona law. We first addressed the law in a pair of rulings on April 28, 2010, before the most recent changes were made. We'll now attempt another pair of rulings -- this one on the question of racial profiling, and a separate item on whether police need to suspect or witness something illegal before proceeding to ask someone about their immigration status.While the new phrasing on racial profiling seems straightforward -- and while the new language will provide opponents of racial profiling a useful weapon in court -- legal experts we spoke to said that it's not crystal clear and undeniable that racial profiling will be impossible under the law.Rather, the Arizona law, even in its revised version, sets up a clash of constitutional principles that could be fought over in the courts for years to come. Indeed, the law almost demands court involvement by expressly authorizing police to consider race to the extent permitted by the United States or Arizona Constitution -- something that is far from nailed down.A big reason for uncertainty is that there is Supreme Court precedent for allowing racial profiling under similar circumstances to those envisioned in the Arizona law.In 1975, the U.S. Supreme Court decided a case called United States vs. Brignoni-Ponce. In that case, a roving unit of the U.S. Border Patrol stopped a vehicle near the Mexican border and questioned the occupants about their immigration status. In this case, the court wrote, the only ground for suspicion is that the occupants appear to be of Mexican ancestry. In a 9-0 decision, the court ruled that because of the important governmental interest in preventing the illegal entry of aliens at the border, the minimal intrusion of a brief stop, and the absence of practical alternatives for policing the border, an officer, whose observations lead him reasonably to suspect that a particular vehicle may contain aliens who are illegally in the country, may stop the car briefly, question the driver and passengers about their citizenship and immigration status, and ask them to explain suspicious circumstances; but any further detention or search must be based on consent or probable cause.In the majority opinion, Justice Lewis Powell continued, The likelihood that any given person of Mexican ancestry is an alien is high enough to make Mexican appearance a relevant factor, even though standing alone it does not justify stopping all Mexican-Americans to ask if they are aliens. In other words, racial factors can be legitimately used in profiling, just as long as they are not the only factors -- language that's similar to the Arizona law's original wording.Complicating matters further, the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals -- the federal court that includes Arizona -- has issued a more restrictive ruling than the Supreme Court on the use of race in profiling. Unlike the Supreme Court, the 9th Circuit ruled that consideration of Hispanic appearance in a stop is impermissible, said Jennifer Chacon, law professor at the University of California-Irvine. This tracks closely the new language added to the law.Legal experts we spoke to said that, at a minimum, this difference of opinion sets up a judicial conflict that needs to be sorted out.In the meantime, even if racial profiling is officially banned, the new Arizona law continues to permit non-racially based profiling, such as profiling based on clothing or behavior. Yet many legal experts we spoke to saw a hazy, and perhaps unenforceable, line between permissible profiles and illegal ones.Kevin Johnson, dean of the law school at the University of California-Davis and a specialist on immigration law, said he worries that local police inadequately trained in immigration law could engage in profiling, either unwittingly or intentionally. My fear is that, with the new addition to the law or not, racial profiling will result, with untrained local law enforcement officers – perhaps unconsciously – relying on racial and/or class stereotypes when determining whether there's reasonable suspicion about one's immigration status.For defendants who feel they were stopped unfairly due to racial profiling, it may be virtually impossible to show, at least for many months if not several years that the police made their decision illegally on racial or ethnic grounds, said Stephen Saltzburg, a law professor at George Washington University. Brewer's office did not respond to a request for comment. Ultimately, the late changes do bolster Brewer's contention that the law prohibits racial profiling. But our legal experts say that it is far from the done deal that she suggests. There are simply too many legal loose ends to be settled in court to be able to say that the late changes to the law will lay to rest questions over the possibility of racial profiling, as Brewer put it. We rule Brewer's statement Barely True.",0.4,0.6,0.8,0.5,0,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.4,Half True

Final Rating: False  ",Greenland's ice sheet isn't shrinking any more rapidly today than it was 80 years ago.,"Steven Koonin, a former Obama administration official and unofficial adviser to the EPA under President Donald Trump, says the fears of rampant climate change are overblown. In a recent video for the conservative group Prager U, Koonin noted several trends that ought to reassure people. Among them, the ice in Greenland. Greenland's ice sheet isn't shrinking any more rapidly today than it was 80 years ago, said Koonin, now a New York University professor of physics. Koonin told us he based this on a widely accepted study of the Greenland ice sheet and rising sea levels. The main problem is that study only went through 2010, and ice losses have accelerated since then. Theres been a steeper and longer lasting decline in recent decades compared with the pre-World War II period Koonin mentioned. Greenland lost ice faster this decade than 80 years ago. Read the full fact-check in our bio. ##ClimateChange ##LearnOnTikTok The Greenland ice sheet is second only to the Antarctic in size, covering about 660,000 square miles. It is a key barometer of climate change, and its fate has great importance for overall sea level changes and impacts on ocean currents. Measuring Greenlands ice involves much more than just tracking the area it covers. Researchers need to factor in the amount of snowfall that adds to its mass, and weigh that against the millions of gallons of water that evaporate into the atmosphere or melt into the water. Plus, in a process called calving, large chunks break off and drift away as icebergs. Satellites provide some of the best information to track trends in the ice, but they date back only to the early 1990s. Before then, the best data came from aerial photographs in the 1930s and 1940s. When the underlying terrain is known, scientists compare pictures over the years to tell what happened with the ice. Using historic air and sea measurements and computer models, researchers can push the estimates of the mass of the ice as far back as the mid-1800s. Koonin told us that he relied on an article about the role of melting ice on rising sea levels. The August 2020 paper noted two periods when Greenland ice added the most to the oceans — around 1940 and after about 1990. The highest amount came in 1937 when Greenlands ice sheet caused the sea level to rise by .76 millimeters. In 2010, the ice sheet added .7 millimeters to the oceans. (Measuring rising sea levels due to the Greenland ice sheet and measuring ice loss from the sheet are two sides of the same coin.) The main issue with this data is that it stops at 2010. The latest report card for the Greenland ice sheet from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said that in 2012 and 2019, the ice sheet saw its greatest losses since regular monitoring began in the 1950s. In 2012, it shed about 464 gigatons, and in 2019, it lost about 532 gigatons. According to NASA, 1 gigaton of ice would cover Central Park in New York and reach 1,119 feet high. Following a period of relative stability from the 1970s to early 1990s, the ice sheet began losing ice at an accelerating rate and has now experienced annual net ice loss every year since 1998, the report said. Many of the researchers who worked on that analysis were part of a project that pulled together multiple ways of measuring the mass of Greenlands ice and built a tool that tracks the ice nearly in real time. They made the full data tables available and, with the help of one of those collaborators, Kristian Kjeldsen at the Geological Survey of Denmark and Greenland in Denmark, we summarized the ice loss trends decade by decade. The overall trend is that losses have been more sustained and deeper than during the pre-WWII period that Koonin referred to in his video. All studies of the Greenland ice sheet find that the numbers bounce around a lot from year to year. Averages for each decade help smooth out the trends. Even with the best methods, pinpoint accuracy is out of reach, and the shaded areas show the high and low estimates, with the solid line showing the mid-points. The further back in time, the bigger the uncertainty. Some observations point to a warm period in the late 1920s and early 1930s, which coincides with glacier retreat in the southeast, Kjeldsen said. But he noted, after 2000, negative numbers are more persistent. The 1930s low point of 206 gigatons of ice sheet loss is not as large as the 247 gigatons average yearly loss between 2010 and 2020. We counted the years of continuous decline. The current stretch of year-on-year losses since 1998 is the longest this century. (We reworked the yearly numbers several ways, looking at five-year periods and average changes during periods of ice loss. The overall trends remained the same.) Researcher Twila Moon, deputy lead scientist with the National Snow and Ice Data Center at the University of Colorado, said the tons of ice lost today actually are more significant than losses in the 1930s. Back then, the ice sheet was bigger. After losing ice in the earlier part of the 20th century, the ice sheet did not expand back to its previous mass and shape, Moon said. So as warming air and ocean temperatures arrived in the later part of the 20th century, the ice loss was picking up from a different starting point. We shared the latest numbers with Koonin, and he highlighted the uncertainties in the estimates. By his calculations, theres about a 40% chance that the losses were greater in the 1930s than in the 2010s. There are different ways to calculate the odds. Andrew Dessler, professor of atmospheric sciences at Texas A&M University, estimated that theres about a 25% chance that the losses were greater in the 1930s than in the 2010s. In either scenario, using either estimate, that would mean theres a greater chance the ice losses were greater in the 2010s than the 1930s. Koonin said that Greenland's ice sheet isn't shrinking any more rapidly today than it was 80 years ago. Koonin relied on a study that had data through 2010. Experts agree that a period of warmer temperatures caused a large loss of ice in the 1930s. But the most recent data shows a period of steeper and longer lasting declines in the Greenland ice sheet between 2010 and 2020 than in the period 80 years ago. There is uncertainty in the data, but Koonins numbers are incomplete and obscure the scale of recent ice losses.",0,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,False

Final Rating: Mostly False  ","In states that have legalized (recreational marijuana), you see steady decreases in youth use if you do it right.","Among the issues taking center stage in Springfield as lawmakers enter the final stretch of the legislative session is whether Illinois should join a growing number of states in lifting a prohibition on recreational marijuana. While the legislation under consideration would bar legal sales to those under 21, critics have raised concerns that the easier access could still lead to greater use among teens. One Democratic lawmaker who spoke in support of the plan when it was unveiled recently by Gov. J.B. Pritzker was state Rep. Kelly Cassidy, a Chicago Democrat. Cannabis should be sold in venues that are highly regulated, taking the pot market out of the shadows, Cassidy said. In states that have legalized, you see steady decreases in youth use if you do it right. PolitiFact in recent years has assessed changes in pot use among youth while investigating claims about how legalization has affected citizens in Colorado, which became the first state in the nation to greenlight retail sales in 2014 after voters approved cannabis for adult recreational use by ballot measure in 2012. Since 2014, the data show no statistically significant uptick in pot usage among teens so legalization hardly leads to the reefer madness some critics feared. But the numbers available for Colorado and other states that have lifted bans for adults also dont reveal the clear pattern of decline in youth pot use that Cassidy described. If lawmakers approve the plan, Illinois could become the 11th state to allow adults to use cannabis recreationally and the second in the Midwest, after Michigan, where voters in November approved a measure legalizing the drug. So far, retail sales are up and running in seven of those states, including three in just the last three years. That makes it harder to come by comprehensive statistics. Cassidy sent us an email promising an aide would share the studies out of Colorado, but nothing arrived from the lawmakers office as of our deadline. She also didnt explain what she meant by do it right. Colorado and Washington were the first states to legalize retail marijuana sales, so they have the longest track records to study. In Colorado, a 2018 report by the state Department of Public Safety'sDivision of Justice reviewed data from the Healthy Kids Colorado Survey, which includes answers to various health questions asked of more than 40,000 middle and high school students every other year. The survey is conducted by the states Department of Public Health & Environment. Results from the survey show 19.7% of Colorado high schoolers reported using marijuana within the past month in 2013, the year before the first retail marijuana store opened. In 2015, that figure rose slightly, but experts told PolitiFact in 2016 that increase was not statistically significant. In 2017, the rate dipped to 19.4%, slightly lower than it had been in previous surveys dating back to least 2005. But the Colorado report includes a major disclaimer. It states upfront that the majority of data related to marijuana legalization is baseline and preliminary, making it difficult to draw conclusions about the potential effects of marijuana legalization and commercialization on public safety, public health, or youth outcomes due to the lack of historical data. Jonathan Caulkins, a public policy professor at Carnegie Mellon University and former co-director of RANDs Drug Policy Research Center, echoed that warning to PolitiFact Illinois. The full effects of cannabis legalization wont be seen for a generation after national legalization, which has not even happened yet, he wrote in an email. As for preliminary state results? Caulkins said that making recreational marijuana legal for adults has done little to affect use by youth — in large part because cannabis was already relatively easy for minors to obtain in those states. Indeed, material included in the Colorado survey characterizes as relatively unchanged the slight variations in teen marijuana use since legalization. Voters in Washington also approved recreational cannabis in late 2012, and retail sales of the drug there began in 2014, six months after Colorado. The state conducts a biennial youth health survey similar to Colorados, which breaks its data down by grades. Its results show some small declines but suggest little has changed there either, with decreases of 1% between 2014 and 2016 among 8th and 10th graders who said they currently used pot, followed by 1% increases for both grades in 2018. For 12th graders, rates fell by 1% the year after retail sales began and have remained at that level, which is in line with pre-legalization rates. The findings with respect to youth are generally mixed and depend critically on what measures of youth use one wants to focus on, said Rosalie Pacula, a senior economist with RAND and current co-director of the Drug Policy Research Center who analyzed survey data for Washington and Colorado in several recent reports. She explained in an email to us that studies of states where adult use is legal generally show either no effect or some decline in past-year or 30-day use rates among youth, depending on the survey data used. But results for more frequent and risky use are a bit more mixed, she said, with some showing an uptick. Changes in the other five states where retail sales are underway are even more difficult to evaluate than Colorado or Washington. Alaskas state survey reported no statistically significant changes since recreational cannabis was approved for adults in 2014 and hit the market in 2016. Results in Oregon, which followed a similar timeline, were mixed. And its too soon to assess results out of Nevada, California and Massachusetts, which each repealed bans in late 2016 but only began allowing sales within the last two years. Cassidy said, In states that have legalized, you see steady decreases in youth use if you do it right. She did not provide any proof to back up her statement. Of the 10 states that allow adults to use cannabis recreationally, only four have permitted retail sales long enough to provide enough data points for a preliminary comparison. While state survey data show no spike in current marijuana use among teens, they also fall short of suggesting the downward trajectory Cassidy described.

Final Rating: Mostly False",The National Debt in my first month went down by $12 billion.,"In an early morning tweet Saturday, President Donald Trump echoed a post on a fringe website claiming that the national debt has decreased by $12 billion since Trump took office. The media has not reported that the National Debt in my first month went down by $12 billion vs a $200 billion increase in Obama first mo., Trump posted on Twitter Feb. 25, 2017. The media has not reported that the National Debt in my first month went down by $12 billion vs a $200 billion increase in Obama first mo. The tweet mirrors an article posted on the Gateway Pundit website a few days earlier. It was repeated by conservative pundit Herman Cain on Fox News shortly before Trumps tweet. On January 20th, the day of the Trump Inauguration, the US Debt stood at $19,947 billion, the Gateway Pundit website reads. On February 21st, a month later, the US Debt load stood at $19,935 billion. Trump cut the US Debt burden by $12 billion and 0.1% in his first month in office! The numbers check out. And in fact, the total public debt has dropped another $22 billion since the Gateway Pundit article published, according to data from the U.S. Department of Treasury. But, experts say, people shouldnt read much into the numbers. Nor should Trump be popping champagne. Considering that Trump hasnt enacted any fiscal legislation, its a bit of a stretch for him to take credit for any changes in debt levels, Dan Mitchell, a libertarian economist and senior fellow at the Cato Institute, told us. Debt levels go up and down in the short run based on independent factors such as quarterly tax payments and predetermined expenditure patterns, he said. The White House did not respond to our query for this fact-check. Looking at the debt numbers Trump and the Gateway Pundit are examining the total public debt outstanding, which is nearing $20 trillion. Experts said another figure to focus on is debts held by the public, which is the amount of money the United States government owes someone else. On Jan. 20, when Trump took office, the debt held by the public sat at $14.4 trillion. That figure fluctuated up and down a bit, but as of Feb. 22, it remained $14.4 trillion. On Feb. 23, the debt held by the public figure dropped to $14.38 trillion. Heres a chart that shows debt figures on selected days since Trump took office. Date Debt Held by the Public Intragovernmental Holdings Total Public Debt Outstanding 01/20/2017 14,403,704,176,388.94 5,543,600,378,823.55 19,947,304,555,212.49 01/27/2017 14,387,267,502,732.51 5,551,752,332,096.38 19,939,019,834,828.89 02/02/2017 14,366,132,157,960.80 5,536,695,305,608.30 19,902,827,463,569.10 02/07/2017 14,365,365,821,333.09 5,530,397,847,836.97 19,895,763,669,170.06 02/09/2017 14,402,429,500,385.19 5,519,906,129,921.50 19,922,335,630,306.69 02/14/2017 14,404,012,711,812.97 5,528,666,521,903.19 19,932,679,233,716.16 02/15/2017 14,417,333,314,382.25 5,520,031,281,120.76 19,937,364,595,503.01 02/16/2017 14,403,392,566,439.40 5,523,188,600,438.96 19,926,581,166,878.36 02/22/2017 14,404,723,995,058.93 5,531,156,856,922.13 19,935,880,851,981.06 02/23/2017 14,384,082,361,381.86 5,529,818,758,806.29 19,913,901,120,188.15 So, in isolation, the debt held by the public is down since Trump took office. But experts say its likely to shoot back up any day. I wonder what he thinks he did to bring this about, said Harvard University government professor Jeffrey Frankel. This one-month number is trivial in the long-run trend. The national debt will rise this year, and in future years. It will rise at a sharply accelerated rate if Trump carries out even half of his campaign promises for specific tax cuts (and specific spending increases). Will he be willing to be judged by the debt numbers in the future? Dean Baker, an economist with the liberal Center for Economic and Policy Research, said the temporary dip in the debt is triggered by the timing of tax payments and government spending, both matters that he has not affected one iota. AddedNeil Buchanan, a George Washington University law professor and author of The Debt Ceiling Disasters:No one who knows anything about budgeting would take a 30-day change to have any meaning at all.There is no credit to take, because it's like noticing that rainfall numbers from one month to the next are not exactly the same or that attendance at baseball games is not a constant number. Donald Marron, Director of Economic Policy Initiatives at the Urban Institute,speculated that the drop in debt may be because President Barack Obamas administration left Trump with cash on hand to run the government. So the government's need to borrow hasn't been high recently. On Jan. 20, the day Trump took office, the federal government had a cash operating balance of $382 billion, according to the Treasury Department. By Feb. 22, the cash balance had dropped to $228 billion. Our ruling Trump tweeted, The National Debt in my first month went down by $12 billion. Trump would be wise to not read too much into this figure, which sounds more noteworthy than it actually is. The national debt fluctuates up and down depending on the day. While the debt is down after one month, experts say that trend will reverse and the debt will continue to rise. This factoid is a gross misrepresentation of the state of the debt and the role the new president had in shaping the figure. Update: This post has been updated to include comments from Neil Buchanan and to include Donald Marron's current title. ",0.5,0.7,1.0,0.6,0.2,0.6,0.5,1.0,0.4,Mostly False

Final Rating: Half True  ",Obama is the Senate's most liberal.,"A new TV ad from the McCain campaign portrays Republican running mate Sarah Palin as a bold reformer and says Sen. Barack Obama is a liberal who offers little more than empty words. The ad, known as Alaska Maverick, begins with the image of aWall Street Journalarticle (really an editorial) that is headlined A reform ticket. The Journal says: 'Governor Palin's credentials as an agent of reform exceed Barack Obama's,'  the announcer says. They're right. She 'has a record of bipartisan reform,'  the announcer says, quoting from an Associated Press article. The screen then shows an article from the political magazineNational Journalas the announcer says He's the Senate's 'most liberal.'  The announcer then says that Palin took on the oil producers while Obama gave big oil billions in subsidies and giveaways. She's earned a reputation as a reformer. His reputation? Empty words. We're previously explored Obama'ssupport of the energy billthat included subsidies for oil companies and we've checked claims aboutPalin's efforts to oppose oil companies, so here we'll focus on the claim that he's the most liberal senator. Obama-as-lefty has been a trusty Republican talking point since January 2008, whenNational Journalannounced its annual ratings for 2007 had determined he was the most liberal senator. We checked the McCain charge in June withthis article,but the charge will be new to many of our readers, so we'll explore it again here. Republican candidates often brand their Democratic opponents as liberals to portray them as candidates who favor big government and high taxes. Linguists who study political rhetoric say Republicans have been so effective at giving the word a negative connotation that many Democrats won't call themselves liberals. They prefer progressives. Still, many political scientists and journalists use the term to represent the Democratic extreme of the political spectrum, andNational Journal,a nonpartisan political magazine, uses a liberal-conservative scale for its annual rating of congressional votes. The magazine's editors and reporters choose key votes on major issues and those that they believe exhibit a split between liberals and conservatives, and then calculate how often senators and House members vote each way. They calculate the liberal/conservative votes in three areas — economic, social issues and foreign policy — and then average them for a composite score. The annual rankings generate some publicity for the magazine, especially in election years. In 2004, the magazine said the most liberal senator was Sen. John Kerry, who became the Democratic nominee for president. On Jan. 31, 2008, five days before the Super Tuesday primaries,National Journalpublished an article headlined Obama: Most Liberal Senator in 2007. The article said Obama had missed 33 of the 99 votes that were rated but that it was enough for a calculation. The magazine said McCain was not rated because he missed more than half the votes in the economic and foreign-policy categories. Since Obama's rating was announced, McCain and other Republicans have frequently cited it to criticize Obama. Yet other ratings don't show Obama as the Senate's top lefty. He wasn't the top liberal in his two other years in the U.S. Senate according toNational Journal. He was 10th-most liberal in 2006 and 16th in 2005. The McCain campaign also cites a 2006 rating by the liberal group Americans for Democratic Action that gave Obama 95 percent, which the campaign noted was the same as Kerry and Sen. Barbara Boxer. But there's a little sleight of hand in that one. Although the McCain campaign is correct that Obama earned a 95 percent rating that year for voting the way ADA wanted, there were 10 senators who got more liberal scores than Obama, including Barbara Mikulski of Maryland and Richard Durbin of Illinois. (In the latest ADA rating, for 2007, Obama missed five of the 20 votes the group scored, so he received a 75 percent rating. But he voted the way ADA wanted on each of the 15 votes he attended.) Voteview.com, a site created by political scientists that plots lawmakers on a liberal-conservative scale based on their voting patterns, calculated there were nine senators more liberal than Obama in the current Congress, including Russ Feingold of Wisconsin, Chris Dodd of Connecticut and Bernie Sanders of Vermont. Obama is a liberal, but he's not the most liberal, said Keith Poole, a University of California-San Diego professor who runs the site. Ratings fromCongressional Quarterlydon't measure liberal/conservative votes, but they show Obama is not quite as partisan as other senators. In CQ's calculation of party unity, which measures how often members vote with their party on bills where Republicans and Democrats split, Obama got a 97 percent rating last year. Ten Democrats had higher scores. On votes where President Bush indicated his position, CQ found Obama supported the Republican president 40 percent of the time in 2007, which put Obama in the middle of the pack for Democrats. He supported Bush 49 percent the previous year. If McCain had made a more general statement about Obama's ideology last year, he could have been more accurate. But McCain's statement that Obama is the most liberal suggests it is a cumulative rating for all of Obama's time in the Senate. But in fact, it is true for onlyonerating foroneyear. Measurements for other years and by other groups show Obama is not the No. 1 liberal — in some cases, far from No. 1. So we find McCain's statement to be Barely True.",0.5,0.6,0.9,0.4,0.2,0.5,0.7,0.8,0.4,Half True

Final Rating: Mostly False  ","Says Gov. Scott Walker raises the pay of inmates, but we don't raise the pay of staff in our correctional institutions.","Wisconsin state employees union leader Marty Beil is no fan of Gov. Scott Walker. And his criticism has not relented since Walker survived an historic recall election in June 2012.Beil took aim at Walker on July 19, 2012 in an interview with John Sly Sylvester, a liberal radio talk show host on WTDY AM-FM in Madison.Walker raises the pay of inmates, Beil complained, but we don't raise the pay of staff in our correctional institutions.In 2011, Walker curbed state employees collective bargaining powers and cut their take-home pay by forcing them to pay more for their pensions and health insurance. He also put tighter restrictions on overtime for corrections workers.But has the Republican governor increased the pay of inmates who work in prisons, yet not given raises to the officers who work there?Beil's evidenceBeil is executive director of the Madison-based Council 24 of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees union, which represents corrections officers and a variety of other state employees.Asked for evidence to back his claim, he forwarded to us a May 2012 email from Lizzie Tegels, warden of the New Lisbon Correctional Institution, a 500-cell, medium-security prison 80 miles northwest of Madison.It says the prison would no longer pay a lower wage to inmates during their first 60 days of work. Paying new inmate workers a few pennies per hour less during their probationary period costs more -- in staff time to adjust pay rates -- than if the inmates received the regular wage, the email said.So, this isnt giving any working inmates a pay raise. Rather, inmates new to working would get a higher starting wage than they would have previously, but only during their first two months on the job.Beil told us the change wasn't occurring only at New Lisbon, but suggested we contact the Department of Corrections for details.Since Beil's claim was aimed at Walker, we contacted the governor's office, as well as the Department of Corrections. Walker spokesman Cullen Werwie and DOC spokeswoman Linda Eggert confirmed that corrections employees have not received a general raise since Walker took office in January 2011.Indeed, lawmakers in November 2011 imposed a two-year pay freeze on state employees, although merit raises can be given.So, the second part of Beils claim, that corrections workers havent gotten any raises under Walker, is correct. DOC response As for inmate pay, the governors spokesman provided a response written by the office of Corrections Secretary Gary Hamblin.According to the memo:Wisconsin prisons can pay working inmates a lower wage during their probation period, but most don't; neither does Badger State Industries, which oversees the manufacturing of license plates and other goods made by inmates.Eliminating the lower pay rate at New Lisbon means that current and future workers now start at the regular pay grade. That ranges from 9 to 42 cents an hour (and 1 to 20 cents through Badger State Industries). About 1,000 inmates work at New Lisbon, with about 20 to 25 on probationary status at any given time.Eggert said DOC surveyed all prisons after we contacted her and found that none had given inmates any raises or eliminated lower probationary rates like New Lisbon did.So, the higher pay rate is limited to the relatively few working inmates at one prison, and only applies to their first two months on the job.Our ratingBeil said Walker has raised the pay of working inmates, but we don't raise the pay of staff in our correctional institutions. Neither group, however, has received a pay raise.The pay rate at one prison is now higher for new workers during their two-month probation period, but that was done not to give inmates raises but to save money for taxpayers.",0.5,0.5,1.0,0.5,0.3,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.4,Mostly False

Final Rating: Mostly False  ",SaysCongressman Jack Kingston voted to raise his pay seven times.,"Veteran U.S. Rep. Jack Kingston of Savannah and millionaire businessman David Perdue are stepping up their attacks as decision day rapidly approaches in the GOP primary runoff for the U.S. Senate. Kingston and Perdue are locked in whats arguably the most contentious and closely watched Georgia contest on the July 22 primary runoff ballot. Charges and countercharges are flying. One of the charges being leveled by Perdue, the front-runner in the May primary, is that Kingston has wasted tax dollars on earmarks all while voting to raise his own pay seven times. PolitiFact has already examined the claim about Kingstons record on earmarks. Now, well delve into the second part of the claim thats currently airing on television and radio and answer the question: Did Kingston, a member of Congress since 1993, vote to raise his own congressional pay seven times? With public opinion of Congress in the tank, House and Senate members have been loath to raise their own pay. Thats likely why congressional raises are a campaign issue, not just this year and not just in Kingstons race. That also may explain why fact-checking the claim is more complicated than simply pulling legislation and checking individual House and Senate members votes. First, a little history. Article I, Section 6, of the Constitution requires members of Congress to set their own pay. From 1789 to 1968, members of Congress passed specific bills that raised their pay 22 times, according to a June 2014 report by the Congressional Research Service. Members of Congress were initially paid a daily rate -- $6 a day in 1789 -- and drew their first annual salary -- $1,500 -- in 1815. Forty years later, they were drawing $3,000 a year. But since passage of the Ethics Reform Act of 1989, members of the House and Senate have been eligible for annual raises without having to be on-record voting for them. The raises are calculated by a formula that involves changes in private-sector wages and salaries. They are automatic each Jan. 1 unless Congress votes to reject the adjustment or votes to change the amount. According to the Congressional Research Service, lawmakers have let their pay be increased automatically 13 times. Theyve also voted to decline or delay their raises during 11 years, including in 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013 and 2014. Kingston voted with the majority eight times. That is, Kingston voted to limit his pay, not increase it. In January 2009, congressional salaries went from $169,300 to their current $174,000. (And unless they vote again to decline a raise, lawmakers pay is set to increase 1.6 percent, or $2,800, in January, according to recent estimates.) So how can Perdue say that Kingston voted to raise his own pay seven times when automatic pay raises were established in 1989 and Kingstons only been in Congress since Jan. 3, 1993? Heres the simple answer: Perdues not counting Kingstons votes in favor of raising congressional salaries. Instead, Perdues counting procedural votes Kingston cast. Those votes blocked efforts to nix the automatic pay raises. PolitiFact checked a similar claim in 2011 when U.S. Rep. Connie Mack IV came under attack by Republican rival George LeMieux in Floridas U.S. Senate race. That was rated a Half True. Perdues claim, like LeMieuxs, is based largely on procedural votes. The votes by Kingston took place in 1999, 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004, 2006 and 2007, Perdue spokesman Derrick Dickey said. We'll try to explain a complicated process as simply as we can. A member of Congress -- for years it was U.S. Rep. Jim Matheson, D-Utah -- pushes for an up-or-down vote on continuing the automatic pay raises. In most years, a procedural vote is used to effectively block that effort. Alyson Heyrend, Matheson's then-spokeswoman, explained the procedural move to PolitiFact in 2011. Matheson each year sought a 'no' vote on a procedural vote on Ordering the Previous Question, she told Politifact in an email. Had a majority voted 'no' he would have then offered the amendment to deny the annual congressional pay raise. Matheson was concerned that the public isn't able to see Congress take an open, up-or-down vote on whether or not to raise their salaries, Heyrend said. Pete Sepp, executive vice president of the National Taxpayers Union and Foundation, said its important to understand that any efforts on the pay raises are always tied to larger bills dealing with appropriations. People of varying ideologies and causes would have numerous reasons for supporting or opposing the bill, Sepp said, meaning that votes for or against a bill could have something or nothing to do with the pay raise. In 1999, for instance, Rep. Ernie Fletcher, R, Ky., argued that lawmakers shouldnt take a $3,800 raise, boosting their pay to $145,000 a year, saying: I have a hard time voting to increase my pay when people in my district are earning an average income of $25,000 a year. According to press reports from the time, Fletchers move was defeated on a procedural vote, 250-173. House journals show Kingston voting with the majority. The journals also show Kingston voting Yes with the majority on similar procedural votes in 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004, 2006 and 2007. Those votes blocked efforts by Matheson, Fletcher and others to put forth an amendment to stop the pay raise. And even if they had not been blocked, a majority would have still had to go along with their amendment, several congressional experts told us. So, did Kingston vote seven times to give himself a raise? No. He didnt have to because the raises are automatic unless Congress votes to turn them down as they have for five years. Did he vote to stop a push for an up-or-down vote on accepting or rejecting the raises? Yes. He did that seven times. But he also voted with the majority to deny or delay the raises eight times. Greg Dolan, Kingstons congressional spokesman, said: Representative Kingston was not voting to increase his pay any more than he was voting against renaming the moon. Just because a potential amendment may have been introduced, voting to get on with the work of the House is not equivalent to voting against any and all other extraneous issues, he said. Dickey, Perdues spokesman, said the pay raises were inappropriate and Kingston knew that as far back as 1992 when he told a Savannah paper that congressional raises should be tied to passage of a balanced budget Our ruling Congress has created a system that allows its members to receive annual raises without having to vote on them. Perdue is off base to say Kingston voted to raise his pay seven times. Kingston cast procedural votes -- with the majority -- that effectively allowed Congress automatic pay raises to stand in some years. Kingston did not cast direct votes to raise his pay as Perdues ads imply. When there was a direct vote to decline pay increases, Kingston voted with the majority to do just that eight times. Theres a bit of truth to Perdues claim. But theres even more context missing. ",0,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,Mostly False

Final Rating: Half True  ","Says Sen. Gary Peters, D-Mich., is known for doing nothing.  (Peters) skipped 84% of small business hearings (and) skipped 89% of hearings on China.","In the race for one of the few vulnerable Senate seats held by a Democrat this year, Republican John James is targeting Michigan Sen. Gary Peters as an ineffective, invisible incumbent. A recent campaign ad, distilled this argument, which James has echoed elsewhere. They call him the invisible man, the politician known for doing nothing, Gary Peters. Nothing to prepare us for covid. His responsibility. Nothing for our economy. Peters doesnt show up for work. Skipped 84% of small business hearings. Nothing to protect workers. Skipped 89% of hearings on China. But Peters has done one thing: Got rich in public office. Doubled his wealth. Gary Peters: Invisible for Michigan Poor committee attendance is a time-worn argument by challengers, one we have seen many times before. Here, well look at James assertion that Peters is known for doing nothing and that he skipped 84% of small business hearings (and) skipped 89% of hearings on China. Peters served three terms in the House, then was elected to the Senate in 2014. He is seeking a second term this year, against James, a West Point graduate and Army combat veteran. James ran for the Senate in 2018 but lost to Democratic incumbent Debbie Stabenow. James campaign staff said the numbers refer to Peters service on the House Small Business Committee and the Congressional Executive Commission on China, which he joined as a senator in 2015. Committee attendance statistics are not easily accessible; determining them requires scrutinizing transcripts of dozens of committee hearings, some of them made public months after the hearing, to see whether a lawmaker participated. The James campaign said they found that Peters missed 43 of the 51 Small Business Committee hearings in 2011 and 2012, when he was serving in the House and before he was elected to the Senate. As for the China commission, the James campaign said it used the same method and found that Peters missed 16 of 18 meetings since Peters joined the committee. (Here are all the hearings with links, courtesy of the James campaign.) When we contacted Peters campaign, they didnt dispute the James campaigns numbers. But they said the figures amount to cherry-picked metrics of Peters level of engagement in Washington. For starters, they said the Small Business Committee attendance rate references activities nearly a decade ago. During his three terms in the House, Peters was also a member of the House Financial Services Committee, a more powerful panel. A lot of committees will schedule hearings at the same time, making it virtually impossible to attend, in a meaningful sense, all of them, said Joshua Huder, a Georgetown University political scientist. Roll Call, a Washington publication that covers Congress, wrote in 2014 that unless the senator wields the gavel, he or she may only show up for five minutes, or when it is their turn to ask questions. The focus on committee attendance also overlooks that Peters co-sponsored the Small Business Jobs Act, which eased access to credit by small businesses and was signed into law by President Barack Obama. Currently, in the Senate, Peters serves on the Armed Services Committee, the Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee, and the Homeland Security and Government Affairs Committee. Each of those committees is considered influential, yet its notable that the ad focuses on the China panel, which is not a traditional congressional committee and does not generate or approve legislation. The panel was created in 2000 to monitor China's compliance with international human rights standards, to encourage the development of the rule of law in China, and to maintain a list of victims of human rights abuses in China. It is charged with submitting an annual report to the president. Fox News reported that many of the members of the commission ... had spotty attendance at the commission's hearings. Steven S. Smith, a political scientist at Washington University in St. Louis, said the China panel is a different kind of creature. It exists to monitor activity in China, which is largely done by staff, Smith said. He added that the Trump administration has not filled the five seats that are reserved for presidential appointees. Theres also another metric to gauge how active Peters has been in the Senate: The percentage of floor votes missed. In 2019, the most recent full year available, Peters missed exactly zero floor votes, which put him in a 16-way tie for the best vote attendance in the chamber. Peters 100% voting rate was equal to that of the chambers two leaders, Sens. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., and Chuck Schumber, D-N.Y. That record indicates that Sen. Peters was on the job, Smith said. Finally, Peters has received high marks for effectiveness from the Center for Effective Lawmaking, an independent institution run by Vanderbilt University and the University of Virginia. During the 2017-18 congressional year, the center ranked Peters as the fourth-most effective Democrat out of 48 in the chamber. The measurement is based on the bills lawmakers sponsor, how far those bills move through the legislative process, and how significant their policy proposals are. Intra-party comparisons are the most reliable, since theres a major difference in clout between a majority senator and a minority senator. Despite his minority-party status, he was very active in navigating a number of legislative items through the Republican-controlled Senate, Alan Wiseman, the centers co-director, told the Michigan Advance. His success in advancing his legislative agenda in the 115th Congress is greater than one would expect, given his relatively low seniority in the Senate. Meanwhile, the Lugar Center and Georgetown Universitys McCourt School of Public Policy rated Peters third among Democratic senators, and 12th overall, in bipartisanship in 2019. James said that Peters is known for doing nothing.  (Peters) skipped 84% of small business hearings (and) skipped 89% of hearings on China. The percentages are accurate, but they are cherry-picked because they ignore multiple other measurements that indicate a high level of engagement by Peters in Washington, including recent influential committee assignments, a perfect record on floor votes, and high scores on effectiveness from independent academic analyses.",0.5,0.7,0.9,0.6,0.4,0.6,0.5,0.7,0.5,Half True

Final Rating: Mostly False  ",Wisconsin has no tracing program going on that we can speak of.,"Facing a growing push to re-open Wisconsin, Gov. Tony Evers has laid out a series of key benchmarks for easing social distancing restrictions, dubbed the Badger Bounce Back plan. The state is tracking data on cases, symptoms and hospital usage, but Evers has also pointed to three other logistical elements: access to personal protective gear, expanded testing and expanded contact tracing. Senate Majority Leader Scott Fitzgerald homed in on the last of those while criticizing Evers in an April 26, 2020, interview with WISN-TVs UpFront program. We need better information. More explanations, said Fitzgerald, R-Juneau. They have no tracing program going on that we can speak of. Contact tracing, done by public health officials, is the process of supporting patients with suspected or confirmed infections. Steps include identifying who else they had contact with, warning those other individuals and educating everyone exposed on how to protect themselves and others through isolation and other steps. Its a fundamental element of the pandemic response, helping to identify clusters of cases early on to minimize the spread. Does Wisconsin really have no such program to speak of? Asked for evidence of the claim, Fitzgerald spokesman Alec Zimmerman said this: The point he was trying to make is the same that (Wisconsin Department of Health Services) makes daily in the briefings -- tracing as it is now isnt enough. Zimmerman noted the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel has reported on shortcomings in the system. For instance, the newspaper contacted 10 people who had the disease or lost loved ones within the first few weeks of the outbreak, and seven said they were never contacted by health officials as of April 23 when the story published. A story published May 1, 2020, detailed how Milwaukee has added staffing and made other changes to improve the tracing program. Health officials across the nation are scrambling to add contact tracers. The number of tracers needed for the pandemic is about double the usual need, according to the National Association of County and City Health Officials. Public health nurses do this regularly, for example, for sexually transmitted diseases or tuberculosis, DHS spokeswoman Elizabeth Goodsitt said in an email. What is new in this space is mainly the large scale of cases and the speed at which the virus is able to spread – which means we need additional contact tracers to do this work so that we are able to reach each identified exposed person really quickly. DHS doesnt know how many tracers are working in Wisconsin or how many tracing investigations have been done since those efforts are lead by local health departments. DHS Deputy Secretary Julie Willems Van Dijk said at the April 28 COVID-19 media briefing that the goal is to have 1,000 contact tracers between the DHS surge capacity and the capacity of local health departments. The state had trained 400 contact tracers as of April 30 to provide surge capacity for local health departments, Goodsitt said. The number trained was closer to 250 when Fitzgerald made his claim. The state surge team has been part of more than 1,100 interviews (as of April 30), which is just a fraction of calls our local public health tracers have made, Goodsitt said. The number of tracers varies widely among some of the states larger health departments. As of April 25, the Journal Sentinel reported the Milwaukee Health Department had dedicated 19 people to tracing, about 8% of its staff (though that was up to 54 by May 1, 2020). The Washington Ozaukee Health Department had dedicated 15 people, or about 38% of its 40-person staff. CBS 58 reported April 23 that Waukesha County had 30 contact tracers. Milwaukee officials told the Journal Sentinel the initial tracing interview had been conducted within a week for 92% of all positive cases in the city, but its an extensive process. They make about 10 contacts for every positive case. Fitzgerald said Wisconsin has no tracing program going on that we can speak of. Wisconsin — like every other state — is still ramping up the capacity for tracing. And there have clearly been gaps in the work so far. But its a significant exaggeration to summarize that as having no program when hundreds of people are doing this work around the state. Tracing was being done around the state when Fitzgerald said this, and those efforts have continued to ramp up since. ",0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,Mostly False

Final Rating: Mostly False  ",We have more kids take the SAT than any other state in the nation. I mean a high percentage of our kids take the SAT.,"As CNBC pronounced Texas the nation's best state for doing business, Gov. Rick Perry offered reasons why Texas is still on top during an interview with the business-news network. One of them: the number of Texas students participating in a national college-admissions' exam. We have more kids take the SAT than any other state in the nation, Perry said on the July 13 CNBC broadcast. I mean a high percentage of our kids take the SAT. Which is it? Bill White, the Democratic nominee for governor who has stressed education as an important issue, thinks it's neither. Rick Perry proved again yesterday that he simply can't tell the truth when it comes to education, a July 14 press release from White chided, saying that Perry gave blatantly false information about SATs. Later that day, the governor's office issued a press release pointing reporters to a July 14 Fortune magazine article that offered four reasons why Texas beats California in a recession. However, the article also notes that SAT scores in the state have declined over the last few years, and the state ranked 34th among the 52 states and jurisdictions graded on the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) last year. Confused? When we checked with Perry's campaign, spokeswoman Catherine Frazier tweaked the first of Perry's CNBC statements by saying Texas has more students taking the SAT than nearly any other state. According to the College Board, which manages the SAT exams, Texas ranked third in 2009 in the number of SAT takers — 141,733 public and private school students. Of course, Texas was also the second-most populous state. California, the most populous state, had the most SAT participants (207,301), followed by New York (159,886). We turned next to Perry's second statement, that a high percentage of our kids take the SAT — arguably a powerful talking point because a state's percentage of SAT takers signifies its share of potential college students. According to the College Board in 2009, Texas had the 22nd highest SAT participation rate (21st if you don't count the District of Columbia): 51 percent of Texas students in the class of 2009. The national average was 46 percent. Maine had the highest participation rate (90 percent), followed by New York, Massachusetts, Connecticut and D.C. In recent years, neither the percentage of SAT-takers in Texas nor the state's place in the College Board rankings has changed much. In 2008, Texas again came in 22nd, with 50 percent of students taking the test. In fact, as long as Perry has been governor, Texas has ranked 20th, 21st or 22nd. Its share of students taking the test has ranged from a high of 57 percent (2003) to, most recently, a low of 51 percent. So how does the governor's two-part statement score? We'll cut him slack for saying Texas has the most students taking the SAT, since he immediately backed off when questioned. And Texas did have the third-highest number of high-school students who took the SAT in 2009. Perry's statement that Texas has a high percentage of students taking the SAT begs the question: High compared to what? While the share of Texas students who took the test in 2009 exceeded the national average, 20 other states had greater shares of students taking the test including similarly high-population states such as Florida, Pennsylvania and New York. California had a smaller share: 49 percent. We figure high means better than barely above average. To stick with the school metaphor, 51 percent is a failing grade. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.",0.5,0.7,0.8,0.6,0.2,0.5,0.4,0.5,0.4,Mostly False

Final Rating: Mostly False  ",Says Mitt Romney runs away from Ronald Reagan.,"In a web video released on Jan. 13, 2012, Newt Gingrichs presidential campaign took aim at Massachusetts moderate Mitt Romney, comparing him to fellow Bay State politicians (and Democratic presidential losers) Michael Dukakis and John Kerry and even taking him to task for being able to speak French.The ad fires a fusillade of shots designed to show that Romney is too liberal to be a Republican presidential nominee. Weve chosen one of those claims to check.What has Massachusetts given us? the ad asks, offering grainy footage of Dukakis ill-fated tank ride during the 1988 campaign and Kerrys windsurfing from 2004. The video goes on to describe Romney as a Massachusetts moderate who runs away from Ronald Reagan, then cuts to a clip of Romney speaking during a debate while running for Senate in 1994. In the debate, Romney said, Look, I was an independent during the time of Reagan-Bush. Im not trying to return to Reagan-Bush.We have already looked at the question of Romneys view of Reagan, a conservative icon, during a fact-check of a Democratic National Committee ad on Nov. 29, 2011.The DNC ad from 2011 juxtaposes two clips of Romney talking. The first was the same one later used in the Gingrich ad. The second showed Romney standing at a podium saying, The principles that Ronald Reagan espoused are as true today as they were when he spoke them.The 1994 clip, which came during Romneys bid to unseat the late Sen. Edward Kennedy, showed part of an exchange in which the two men had a philosophical discussion about poverty and families. Kennedy, a liberal Democrat, claimed that child poverty rates rose when Republicans occupied the White House.Under the Reagan-Bush economic programs, under the economic programs you want to return to, the total number of children that are living in poverty, the total number of children out of wedlock -- this has happened, you know weve had Republican presidents during this period of time and the cutting back of support systems for children and most of all for families to get jobs, Kennedy said. If youre not going to provide a climate and an atmosphere for men and women to be able to work and provide for their children, youre going to see the breakdown of the family as well.Kennedy said discussions about supporting families shouldnt be used to score political hits, prompting Romney to fire back that he wasnt politicizing the issue -- Kennedy was.I mentioned nothing about politics or your position at all. I talked about what Id do to help strengthen families, and you talked about Reagan-Bush. Look, I was an independent during the time of Reagan-Bush. Im not trying to return to Reagan-Bush, Romney said, in a clear attempt to distance himself from the former president.In our fact-check of the DNC ad, we couldnt find any other references to Romney distancing himself from Reagan beyond the 1994 debate comment. Still, Romney did say it on live television, so we have no quarrel with the Gingrich campaign using it. The Gingrich ad also correctly identified it on-screen as having occurred in 1994, some 18 years ago.But we have a different problem with the Gingrich ad: It erred by using the present tense in the voice-over, saying that Mitt Romney runs away from Ronald Reagan. To us, that means that Romney is still distancing himself from Reagan. And thats definitely not the case.Consider the second clip in the DNC ad, in which Romney was speaking at the annual Reagan lecture at the Reagan library in Simi Valley, Calif., in May 2010. He was talking about Americas position in the world.I have to tell you that Im optimistic. Im optimistic about the future because I recognize that there is a growing awakening among the American people that this administration has put us on the wrong track and that the principles that Ronald Reagan espoused are as true today as they were when he spoke them.After some applause, Romney continued by elaborating on Reagan-like policies emphasizing low taxes, balanced budgets and strong families. While speaking about the need to keep America strong for the sake of world peace, he paraphrased that wonderful line of Reagans:(Reagan) said, Of the four wars that were begun during my lifetime, not one of them was begun because America was too strong. And hes absolutely right, Romney said.We found other examples of Romney's fealty to Reagan's legacy:• During his first presidential campaign in 2007, Romney blasted primary rival John McCain for voting against President George W. Bushs tax cuts. That's failing Reagan 101, Romney said, essentially holding up Reagan as the standard to which Republicans should aspire.• In a debate that year, he was asked whether the primary candidates would support the Republican nominee if it was someone else. Yes, Romney said, then added, I want that nominee, however, to come out of the same mold as Ronald Reagan.• When he proposed a detailed economic plan last year, Romney included a provision for a new Reagan Economic Zone, an international free-trade area designed to reward nations that have embraced free enterprise and open markets.• On Dec. 16, 2011, at a Fox News-sponsored debate, Romney referred to Reagan in explaining his change of heart on abortion. Both Romney and Reagan started off favoring abortion rights before shifting to an anti-abortion stance.I've learned over time, like Ronald Reagan and George Herbert Walker Bush and others, my experience in life over, what, 19 -- 17, 18, 19 years has told me that sometimes I was wrong, Romney said. Where I was wrong, I've tried to correct myself.• On Dec. 15, 2011, the Romney campaign unveiled a group called Reaganites for Romney, featuring officials who served in political or policy roles during the Reagan Administration.These individuals were part of a movement that changed America and the rest of the world, said Romney. The smaller government policies of the Reagan era helped turn around a struggling economy and create millions of jobs. And the strong defense of freedom around the world led to the crumbling of empires and dictatorships. I am proud to announce this group of conservative leaders – with their help we can recreate the robust job creation of the Reagan years.Our rulingGinrgichs ad contains a grain of truth: In one televised debate 18 years ago, Romney distanced himself from Reagan and his policies. But more recently, Romney has had only kind words to say about the Gipper. When the DNC charged that Romney had flip-flopped on his support for Reagans policies, we ruled that charge Mostly True. In this case, though, we dont think Romneys long-ago discomfort with Reagan-era policies justifies the Gingrich ads claim that Romney is a Massachusetts moderate who runs away from Ronald Reagan.",0.5,0.7,0.8,0.4,0.3,0.6,0.5,0.4,0.5,Mostly False

Final Rating: Half True  ",A bill supported by Gov. Scott Walker makes it so that drunk drivers who kill have an easier time of it.,"State prosecutors are scrambling to fend off fresh legal challenges to drunken-driving cases, with defense lawyers scoring some early victories under restrictive new evidence standards.The new rules -- which can make it harder to get police testimony and field sobriety tests admitted into court -- sprang from a legal-reform push in January 2011 by Gov. Scott Walker and Republican lawmakers.Republicans primary goal was to make it easier to block unreliable expert testimony and so-called junk science in negligence lawsuits against businesses.But the change applies to all types of civil and criminal actions, a move that led the state district attorneys association to predict before passage that the new rules would significantly curtail our ability to prove our cases -- including in charges of operating while intoxicated.That aspect of the law got a sharper characterization when the Democratic Party of Wisconsin -- gearing up for a recall drive against Walker -- blasted the governor on a host of issues.Amid complaints about the budget bill, concealed carry legislation and changes related to sex-ed in schools, the party in a news release declared that a Walker administration move makes it so that drunk drivers who kill have an easier time of it.Amid the rhetoric is an interesting claim:Does Act 2, the legal reform legislation, really mean an easier go for drunken drivers, either in criminal prosecutions or in personal injury suits against them?Asked to back up its claim, the Democrats cited three pieces of evidence: Mothers Against Drunk Drivers opposition to Act 2; the bills limits on court-ordered punitive damages in civil cases; and changes that make it harder for people to testify as experts.But Republicans decided to exempt drunken-driving crash victims from the punitive damage limits in civil cases. So that point is off the mark.The Mothers Against Drunk Drivers position is a moving target. The group opposed the bill initially, but then dropped its opposition after lawmakers added the punitive damage exemption -- and is now seeking a partial legislative fix in reaction to the new evidence rules.As for the evidence rules themselves, prosecutors say the issue is real and the change puts new pressures on them.We talked to numerous lawyers and researchers and they said the changes were significant, but welcome in concept. Almost all agreed the old standards allowed in too much. The new standards are used in federal courts, and by more than 30 states.Since the bills Feb. 1, 2011 start date, challenges to OWI evidence have played out in courtrooms and prosecutors offices under the new law. Both sides expect many more battles as the Daubert standard rules (from a Supreme Court case, Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals Inc.) come into play in more cases. In our interviews with lawyers in several counties, we did not discover any OWI homicide trials affected by the new Daubert standard -- the focus of the Democrats claim. But those cases would be subject to the same advantages and disadvantages as other OWI cases.And there are some examples we can dig into there: In the very early stages here, we found that a loose cadre of defense attorneys are sharing tips on how to mount challenges that DAs told us cause worrisome delays. This will protract cases in the long run, said Gerol, who likes the Daubert standard overall.But whats been the experience of prosecutors and defense lawyers in states that already have Daubert?Nationally, the reality doesnt look one-sided, we found.Generally speaking prosecutors have found the new standards to be fairly neutral, just more work in defending the reliability of tests and witnesses, said Scott Burns, executive director of the National District Attorneys Association.On the defense side, national expert Michael Hawkins of Atlanta, said the tougher rules could produce an unintended benefit for some defendants, but only when evidence doesnt pass legal muster.It doesnt make it easier on drunk drivers, said Hawkins, a National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers expert on drunken driving issues. It makes it so prosecutors have to do more work to assure judges and juries that the evidence they are using is accurate and reliable.Yes, prosecutors in Wisconsin are having a tougher go of it in first skirmishes here.But the rules apply to both sides.Defense attorneys acknowledge they will have have to introduce better and more reliable evidence under the new standards as well.In fact, Andrew Mishlove, a nationally certified OWI defense lawyer who is helping train judges and lawyers on the new standards, told us a half-dozen common defense strategies might wilt now under the tougher evidence rules.Among them: That testing equipment failed, or that radio frequency interference led to false readings of blood-alcohol level.Overall the new standard will prevent the defense from putting on bogus experts or questionable experts, said Donald Ramsell, an Illinois-based OWI lawyer who is nationally recognized.Ramsell noted something pertinent to the Democrats claim about drivers who kill.He and others said both sides will have a tougher time presenting testimony on estimates of a persons intoxication level at the time of an incident -- when the test wasnt taken until hours after the arrest. In fatal-crash homicide cases, the prosecution will be hurt more often in that scenario, Ramsell said, because often the drunken driver is often injured too, preventing a timely blood test.Looking ahead, what can we expect?On the prosecution side, the big concern is that arresting officers were formerly treated as experts who could draw conclusions about sobriety tests -- but now are being challenged, along with the tests, and police training methods.In cases that already have some evidence weaknesses -- for example, the defendant refused breath and blood tests, or the tests were delayed -- these challenges can be important, lawyers on both sides said.Under the new system, judges are the gatekeepers of what is reliable and relevant scientific testimony, in contrast to past practice of letting juries hear almost everything.Some judges have concerns about testimony that has been routinely allowed in the past -- such as the follow-the-finger vision test known as Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus (HGN). Those test are not allowed as evidence in some states.There are judges that feel like (the vision test) is voodoo because of a conception they have, said Emily Thompson, an assistant district attorney in Dane County who handles crash cases, including fatalities involving alcohol.Such concerns have led the Wisconsin chapter of MADD, the advocacy group, to call for the Legislature to revisit Act 2and exempt drunken-driving cases from the new evidence rules.This aspect is troubling and MADD hopes the Legislature remedies the oversight as we support prosecutors who often face a daunting task in making sure justice is served and criminal charges relating to drunk driving are fully prosecuted, MADD spokesman Frank Harris told us.Ultimately the states high courts will decide how the issue plays out.But most experts and lawyers are predicting neither side will gain clear advantage; others say wait and see. Some prosecutors see some advantages long-term. Theres agreement that fairness will increase.Said Marquette University law professor Daniel Blinka when asked if OWI defendants would have an easier time: I dont see how thats going to happen.Our conclusionThe Democratic Party of Wisconsin claimed that one of Walkers actions was to make it so that drunk drivers who kill have an easier time of it.One of their talking points to back up the statement -- related to civil lawsuits -- doesnt hold up given amendments made to the bill. Their other issue, regarding Act 2s tougher standard for scientific testimony, clearly does affect drunken driving prosecutions.And the law already has benefited some drunken drivers, though not in every instance where scientific evidence was challenged. (We did not find a homicide case affected, but they would be subject to similarly varied effects as would regular OWI cases.) So we think theres an element of truth in the Dems statement. Some defendants already have found an easier road.But the statement implies the net effect of the law is tipped pro-defense. In OWI cases, that is an unknown at this point. Both sides -- defense and prosecution -- are subject to the new standards. And even defense-side experts dont buy the easier road argument.Finally, we think its misleading to suggest -- as the partys statement did -- that the intent of the bill was to favor homicidal drunken drivers. It clearly wasnt.",0.5,0.5,1,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,1,0.5,Half True

Final Rating: Mostly False  ","Says military commanders have said that if Donald Trump were elected, they would not follow his orders.","During a joint speech with Hillary Clinton in his ancestral home of Scranton, Pa., Vice President Joe Biden riffed on the ways he sees Donald Trump as being unfit for the presidency. One of the things that Biden said troubled him among Trumps past comments is his suggestion that the United States may need to utilize torture. Biden said that Trump has floated the use of torture when he knows it's illegal, and says he would still order it even though the military commanders said they would not obey his orders. When can you think of ever in history where military commanders have said before a man or woman is elected that they would not follow his orders? Biden has a point that Trump has advocated loosening laws on torture, including -- but not limited to -- waterboarding. Just one example: Trump said on CBSs Face the Nation that the United States needs tostrengthen the laws so that we can better compete with the brutal tactics of ISIS, and he dismissed the idea that allowing torture would be stooping to ISIS' level. We have to play the game the way they're playing the game, Trump said. You're not going to win if we're soft. In addition, Trump has proposed killing the families of terrorists, a policy that, as we have written before, would violate the Geneva Conventions. However, Bidens remark suggests that active military commanders have already said before the election that they would not follow certain orders issued by Trump. Thats an overstatement, although one that contains some degree of truth. Lets take a closer look. Who has said what about Trump so far? We could find no evidence -- and Bidens staff couldnt point to any -- showing active military commanders saying they would not follow certain orders from a President Trump. Typically, military officers do not comment on political matters while on active duty, in order to stay within the strictures of Defense Department Directive 1344.10. Senior national security retirees, though, are another story. Bidens staff pointed to comments made in February by former CIA director Michael Hayden on HBO's Real Time with Bill Maher. When Maher brought up Trump's idea of killing family members of terrorists, Hayden said, If he were to order that once in government, the American armed forces would refuse to act. Maher responded, What? Well, thats quite a statement, sir. In the meantime, 50 senior Republican national security officials signed a letter on Aug. 8, 2016, arguing that Trump lacks the character, values and experience to be president and would put at risk our countrys national security and well-being. The letter did not explicitly say that the signers would personally refuse, or encourage active commanders to refuse, an illegal order from Trump. But the letter represented a sharp rebuke to Trumps fitness for office by members of his partys national security establishment. We should point out that Trump does have some senior military retirees on his side as well, including former Defense Intelligence Agency chief Michael T. Flynn, decorated Army Maj. Gen. Bert Mizusawa, retired Marine Corps Brig. Gen. Mark Bircher, retired four star Air Force Gen. Robert Oaks, and retired Army Maj. Gen. Paul Vallely. Bottom line: In his Scranton comments, Biden exaggerated by saying that current military commanders have publicly said they would not follow illegal orders from Trump. Theres no evidence of that. What does the law say? That said, Bidens overstatement is somewhat moot -- because whether or not military commanders have publicly said in advance that they would refuse illegal orders, theres solid legal precedent that they should refuse an illegal order if one came their way. Under both international law and domestic law, a soldier has a duty to disobey a manifestly unlawful order, said Steven R. Ratner, a law professor at the University of Michigan. It doesnt matter who gave it. According to the Manual for Courts-Martial, if an order is patently illegal, a service member has an obliga­tion to disobey it, said Richard D. Rosen, director of the Texas Tech University's Center for Military Law & Policy. The so-called Nuremberg Defense to criminal activity — I was only following orders — excuses a service ­members crimi­nal actions only if the ordered actions are not palpably illegal, Rosen said. This represents a pretty high standard. However, the types of orders at issue here -- such as the infliction of torture and the intentional killing of civilians -- would likely qualify, experts said. I believe that an order to target and kill civilians intentionally, such as killing the families of terrorists, is patently illegal, and I would advise commanders and soldiers not to follow the order, Rosen said. He cited the Vietnam War case of Lt. William Calley, a platoon leader who was accused of killing civilians, including women, children, and elderly men, in the village of My Lai in South Vietnam. Calleys defense was that he was executing the orders of his company commander, but both the Army Court of Military Review and Court of Military Appeals rejected Calleys defense, Rosen said. How unusual is the backlash against Trump? Finally, experts say Biden has a point about the unusual extent of senior military concern about a presidential candidates potential for ordering illegal acts from the White House. There have certainly been overt disputes between presidents and commanders, such as between President Abraham Lincoln and Maj. Gen. George McClellan and between President Harry Truman and Gen. Douglas MacArthur, Rosen said. But I am not aware of cases in which active-duty servicemembers actually took sides in a political campaign. Anthony Clark Arend, a Georgetown University professor of government and foreign service, agreed. I can think of no historical precedent for members of the military and foreign policy community making statements relating to the need to disobey unlawful orders during a presidential campaign, Arend said. This truly seems unprecedented. Our ruling Biden said military commanders have said that if Trump were elected, they would not follow his orders. Biden has a point that retired military officials have spoken out against Trump. But he exaggeratedwhen he described them as military commanders. The current active leadership has not spoken out against Trump.",0.5,0.5,1,0.5,0,0.5,0.5,1,0.5,Mostly False

Final Rating: Mostly False  ",The Federal Reserve system has presided over about a 95... percent decline in the U.S. dollar.,"The dollar ain't what it used to be, and State Board of Education member Barbara Cargill wants Texas students to know it. The board hammered out more than 300 proposed changes to the state's social studies curriculum in its January and March meetings, among them revisions to an economics course that touches on the role of the Federal Reserve in establishing monetary policy. Cargill, a former science teacher from The Woodlands near Houston, proposed an amendment requiring students to analyze the decline in the U.S. dollar since the inception of the Federal Reserve system in 1913. When Gail Lowe, the board chair, asked Cargill if she'd like to speak to her amendment at the March 11 meeting, Cargill said: Well, I think it stands for itself. The Federal Reserve system has presided over a 95... percent decline in the U.S. dollar. Board member Patricia Hardy questioned Cargill's statement: It's amazing how this board knows so much about so many different subjects but I think this is innately biased in its statement and there would be lots of economists who would have a question on the role in this way. Another board member, Mavis Knight, asked: Is the Federal Reserve System the only reason why there has been a decline in the U.S. dollar since 1913? We wondered the same thing. In search of an answer, we first delved into the Fed's history. On Dec. 23, 1913, Congress created the the Federal Reserve System to serve as the nation's central bank. Its primary responsibility is to influence the flow of money and credit in the economy, returning all excess earnings to the U.S. Treasury. Currently, the system's seven board members, including Chairman Ben Bernanke, are responsible for U.S. monetary policy. They constitute a majority of the 12-member Federal Open Market Committee, which makes decisions affecting the cost and availability of money and credit. But does that mean the Fed is responsible for the dollar's decline in value over 90-plus years? Cargill didn't respond to our inquiries. (Board members wound up approving a revision of her amendment stating: Analyze the decline in value of the U.S. dollar including abandonment of the gold standard.) Meanwhile, Dan Hamermesh, an economist at the University of Texas at Austin, called Cargill's connection between the Federal Reserve and the declining dollar propaganda that ignores the impact of inflation from 1913 to 2010. The buying power of a dollar in 1913 would be almost $22 today, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics' Consumer Price Index inflation calculator. That matches up with Cargill's claim that the dollar has dropped in value by 95 percent. Then again, annual income per person is about $32,000 today, compared to about $400 in 1913 ($8,757 in 2010 dollars) — a hefty increase in earning power. Barry Bosworth, an economist at the left-leaning Brookings Institute, similarly said the Federal Reserve isn't responsible for the U.S. dollar's value, which he called pretty constant relative to other currencies. The decline in the value of the dollar is the result of inflation, but advocates of the gold standard may argue that it could have been avoided if the U.S. had stayed on the gold standard, so they blame the Federal Reserve Bank, Bosworth said. The value of U.S. dollar was tied to gold until 1973, when the United States, switched from a system of fixed exchange rates to floating rates. In simple terms, inflation is when the price of goods and services rises and buying power erodes. Do Federal Reserve critics blame the Fed for that, too? Jesse Benton, a spokesman for Rep. Ron Paul, R-Lake Jackson, said the congressman agrees with Cargill's claim. Benton said that Paul, a former Libertarian candidate, believes inflation is caused by increases in the money supply — which the Fed controls — rather than prices going up. Dollar-driven inflation (then) causes a rise in prices, Benton said. We think that it's very important to keep that in mind. Robert Auerbach, a professor of public affairs at the University of Texas, former banking committee investigator and author of the book, Deception and Abuse at the Fed: Henry B. Gonzalez Battles Alan Greenspan's Bank, told us Cargill's amendment was misleading because it oversimplified both the dollar's and the Federal Reserve's history. Auerbach was trained by Nobel Prize-winning economist Milton Friedman, one of two free-market economists who board members recently voted to add to the state's curriculum. In his career, Friedman famously championed killing inflation by keeping the supply of money growing at a steady but slow pace, though he later backed off that view, Auerbach said. Monetary policy offers two basic choices, Auerbach said: Letting the money supply grow, fueling inflation, or keeping the reins tight, which can cause severe recessions. If you're limited from printing money, you'd put a huge number of people out of work, he said. Upshot: Cargill's correct that a dollar now has about 5 percent of the buying power it did in 1913, when the Federal Reserve System was created. That's basic math. Yet while a dollar now buys far less than in 1913, Americans also have far more earning power. And the dollar has generally held its value compared to other countries' currencies. The thrust of Cargill's statement is that the Fed presided over, or caused, that decline in value. In contrast, most experts we spoke with trace the decline to inflation over the years rather than specific actions by the Federal Reserve Bank. Though some Federal Reserve critics echo Cargill's point, such debates are best left to the economic experts who have waged them for decades.

Final Rating: Mostly False  ",Says Washington's reach extends to even telling us what kind of light bulb we can use.,"No duh, Gov. Rick Perry has a thing against things from Washington. His new book, Fed Up! Our Fight to Save America from Washington, brims with what-the-hey statements about whassup in our nation's capital including a declaration that lit us up.Saying there's no end to the reach of Washington, Perry writes that Washington is even telling us what kind of light bulb we can use.We asked Perry for backup on that claim and didn't hear back. Then we launched a search for use-this-bulb regulations.What we found: In 2007, Congress voted to improve the efficiency of light bulbs. President George W. Bush signed into law the Energy Independence and Security Act, which set energy efficiency standards for kinds of incandescent lamps (light bulbs), incandescent reflector lamps (like track lighting in your kitchen), and fluorescent lamps, according to a December 2007 summary by the Congressional Research Service. With a few exceptions, the law also prohibits the U.S Coast Guard from purchasing incandescent light bulbs for use in Coast Guard office buildings.Barack Obama, Bush's successor, promised while running for president to to sign a measure into law that begins to phase out all incandescent light bulbs. He said the change would save Americans $6 billion a year on their electric bills. Last year, PolitiFact reported that no such proposal was made it into law, though in June 2009 Obama announced changes in lighting standards. Starting in August 2012, fluorescent tube lamps (most commonly found in offices and stores) and conventional incandescent reflector lamps must become more efficient. The government said such fluorescent and incandescent lamps represented approximately 38 percent and 7 percent, respectively, of total lighting energy use.Our search for instances of the government directing which bulbs residents can use unearthed a June 2010 editorial in the Washington Times objecting to Federal Trade Commission-issued regulations of light-bulb labels. The editorial says the regs were ordered by Congress as part of its 2007 decision to force the more efficient, curlicue-shaped compact fluorescent light bulb on a public that so far has refused to embrace it willingly. Beginning Jan. 1, 2012, the editorial says, bureaucratic rules will phase in, and conventional 100-watt bulbs will be first on the contraband list.Make sense?Jen Stutsman, spokeswoman for the U.S. Department of Energy, told us that conventional incandescent bulbs are not expected to meet the efficiency standards Congress set, though the government expects manufacturers to improve incandescent technologies to meet the higher standards or consumers will move to compact fluorescent light bulbs, LED technologies or halogens. She said new standards for 100-watt bulbs take effect in January 2012. New standards for 75-watt bulbs start in 2013 and standards for 60- and 40-watt bulbs start in 2014.Stutsman said the expected shifts aren't equivalent to the government telling Americans which light bulbs to use. Under no circumstances does it say that a consumer must purchase a specific type of light bulb, Stutsman said.Finally, we sought advice from the Dallas-based American Lighting Association, a trade group whose director of engineering and technology, Terry McGowan, said in an e-mail that it's a stretch to say federal laws are telling us what light bulb to buy. Federal law is requiring that household light bulbs be made more efficient in steps over time as a nationwide energy-saving measure. It's like saying that new cars will have to deliver more miles/gallon. Maybe some people would say that's mandating what kind of car to buy; but that's an interpretation — especially if many cars on the market can meet the miles/gallon requirement, McGowan said.There will still be household light bulbs available, McGowan's e-mail says, noting later that special-purpose bulbs used in appliances or for decorative purposes are exempted. One thing is for sure; what we use for lighting our homes will take some thought — and maybe we'll be changing what we decide to do.So, is Washington telling us what kind of bulb to use?Not yet, though the 2007 law steps up efficiency requirements and that's expected to result in consumers purchasing and using different bulbs. These factors give Perry's statement an element of truth. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published.

Final Rating: Half True  ","Says $1,100 of the tuition paid by every Oregon university student annually goes just to pay the costs of PERS.","PolitiFact Oregon is no stranger to claims about just how much the Public Employees Retirement System drives state spending.Not too long ago, we checked into Gov. John Kitzhabers claim that half of the $1,000 per student increase in spending in primary and secondary education in the next biennium was due to the retirement costs. (The statement was true.) So when fiscal conservative Rep. Dennis Richardson, R-Central Point, made his own retirement system claim, our ears perked right up.In a newsletter to constituents, Richardson noted that $1,100 of the tuition paid by every Oregon university student annually goes just to pay the costs of PERS.The representative's source was a presentation by Jay Kenton, the Oregon University Systems vice chancellor for finance and administration.Kenton had given a presentation on what drives the cost of higher education. Naturally, retirement and health care costs are a big piece of the equation.Essentially what Kenton had done was to take the total retirement costs of employees -- both faculty and staff -- paid in part from tuition. He then prorated the total by actual percentage of it paid with tuition dollars.After all that math, he found that the projected share of an individual students annual tuition going toward university staff retirement benefits for the 2012-13 year was $849. Thats actually about on par for what it was the previous year, too.So how did Richardson get the $1,100 figure? Well, thats where Kentons projections put the figure for the 2013-14 school year, should Kitzhabers proposed reforms not be enacted.With the technical bits out of the way, we went back to Richardsons statement. He said that $1,100 of the tuition paid by every Oregon university student annually goes just to pay the costs of PERS.Hes right, but only if the projections come to pass. In other words, we may get there, but we havent yet. As it is now, that figure is closer to $850. Its still high, to be sure, but its about $250 less than the figure Richardson is using.The ruling: Richardsons statement reads as if weve been at the $1,100 mark for a while, when in truth we havent actually gotten there. If the Legislature passes significant reforms this year -- a big if -- we may never get there.If we were writing a newsletter, wed have gone with the most recent solid figure from the 2011-12 school year, which is about $850. Or, we would have made it clearer that the $1,100 was an extrapolation, a prediction. Richardson did neither.Though his claim is accurate, it requires additional information.",0.7,0.6,1.0,0.5,0.0,0.2,0.4,0.6,0.4,Half True

The cameras were installed in February 2007.Red-light cameras became popular in many cities and counties as a way to reduce the number of motorists who run red lights and hit other vehicles or pedestrians who assumed they had the right of way. There is an ongoing argument about whether the cameras are effective when it comes to reducing accidents. The National Motorists Association, a group advocating motorists rights, has led the fight against the cameras.There is no evidence that these ticket camera systems make drivers more safe, the association states on its website. In fact, the opposite has proven true. Ticket cameras increase accidents!A study by the Federal Highway Administration found that red-light cameras provide a modest aggregate crash-cost benefit. The study found the cameras tend to reduce severe side-impact crashes, but increase less-severe rear-end collisions. The city of Alpharetta has red-light cameras at more intersections (seven) than any community in Georgia, according to state records. Atlanta has working cameras at six intersections, the records show.The city of Snellville, though, removed its cameras a few years ago. City officials said the number of violators was so small that it wasnt cost-effective to keep them.Roswell officials have made a similar case to scrap its cameras, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported.Acenbrak said the city researched the number of wrecks at those intersections three years before the cameras were installed and three years afterward. The state Department of Transportation does not do its own research of wrecks at intersections with red-light cameras. It collects the data from the cities and counties with cameras, a spokeswoman said.Heres what Acenbrak shared with PolitiFact Georgia at both intersections.At the Ga. 9 and Holcomb Bridge Road intersection, there was a slightly higher ratio of collisions there after the camera was installed. Acenbrak said there were three wrecks in the 25 months prior to the cameras. There were three wrecks in the 22 months after the cameras were installed, he said.At Ga. 9 and Mansell Road, there was a higher percentage of wrecks before the cameras were installed as opposed to the total afterward. Acenbraks numbers show there were three wrecks in the 13 months before the cameras were installed, a ratio of one collision about every four months. The director said there were two crashes in the 22 months afterward, a ratio of one wreck every 11 months.Acenbrak said those numbers prove his point, along with other data he presented to us, such as less than 3 percent of wrecks throughout the city each year can be attributed to motorists running red lights.We still have red-light runners, but theyre not causing crashes, he said.To summarize, Acenbrak said the number of wrecks at Roswells red-light camera intersections was virtually the same before and after the cameras were installed. At Ga. 9 and Holcomb Bridge Road, it was almost identical. At Ga. 9 and Mansell Road, the ratio of wrecks after the cameras were installed was smaller. ",1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,True

Final Rating: Mostly True  ",SaySean Hannity said in 2008 that Obamas willingness to meet with North Korea was disturbingwhile Trumps willingness to meet with North Korea is a huge foreign policy win.,"An image shared widely on Facebook and Reddit chides Fox News host Sean Hannity for having a double standard on presidents talking to North Korea. It says that in 2008 Hannity said that President Barack Obamas willingness to meet with North Korea is one of the most disturbing displays of Obamas lack of foreign policy experience. But in 2018, Hannity said President Donald Trumps willingness to meet with North Korea is a huge foreign policy win.  We hit the transcripts and video files. For the most part, those words accurately reflect what Hannity said. A week before Election Day 2008, Hannity gave 10 reasons not to vote for Obama. No. 2 on his list concerned talking to unfriendly regimes. One of the most disturbing displays of Obama's lack of foreign policy expertise came during last year's YouTube debate, Hannity said Oct. 26, 2008. The junior senator from Illinois gave what many called a naive answer for a question from the audience about whether he would meet with the leaders of Syria, Venezuela, Cuba or North Korea without preconditions. Asked during that debate if he would be willing to meet with those leaders without preconditions, Obama said I would, and compared that to previous presidents. Ronald Reagan and Democratic presidents like JFK constantly spoke to the Soviet Union at a time when Ronald Reagan called them an evil empire, Obama said. And the reason is because they understood that we may not trust them and they may pose an extraordinary danger to this country, but we had the obligation to find areas where we can potentially move forward. The image mentioned only North Korea, while Hannity listed several countries. When news broke that Trump was open to meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, Hannity voiced support. A huge foreign policy win for President Trump, Hannity said March 8. Little Rocket Man blinks. Now, the presidents tough rhetoric, his bold action, his severe sanctions, they appear to be working tonight. President Trump is accepting an invitation to meet with the North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un by May, and Pyongyang is agreeing to stop all nuclear and missile tests while these talks are underway. And the sanctions? They will continue. So the text in the image matches what Hannity said. But his criticism of Obama and his praise for Trump came in the context of different policies. Obamas policy on North Korea grew more complicated over time. But initially, it was fairly simple, said Penn State international affairs professor Joseph DeThomas. Preconditions meant that in order for talks to happen, North Korea had to agree that the purpose was the complete denuclearization of North Korea. During the campaign and early in his term Obama was very open to talks without preconditions, DeThomas said. For Trump, the picture is murkier. When Trump tweeted that he would meet with Kim Jong Un, North Korea had not taken any steps toward denuclearization. He said they had talked about it. Kim Jong Un talked about denuclearization with the South Korean representatives, not just a freeze, Trump wrote. Also, no missile testing by North Korea during this period of time. Kim Jong Un talked about denuclearization with the South Korean Representatives, not just a freeze. Also, no missile testing by North Korea during this period of time. Great progress being made but sanctions will remain until an agreement is reached. Meeting being planned! But for North Korea, denuclearization applies to the entire peninsula, which has implications for the American presence and military posture in South Korea. That is not the same as simply agreeing to a North Korea without nukes. DeThomas said testing halts are customary during talks with North Korea. Beyond that, North Korea made no concessions or took any steps toward ending its nuclear program. Trump has imposed stricter sanctions and has been more ready to hint at using military force against North Korea. But in terms of having direct talks between the leaders of both nations, DeThomas said this administration set a lower bar than what previous presidents have demanded. The Trump precondition for talks was that North Korea had to halt nuclear and missile testing for some unspecified period of time prior to commencement of talks, DeThomas said.  In February, Vice President Mike Pence drew headlines when he said sanctions and direct talks could happen at the same time. To some observers, that meant the administration was willing to talk without the precondition of North Korea agreeing to a future free of nukes. DeThomas characterized such words as loosey goosey, but not indicative of a major change. In that regard, when Hannity praised Trump, the administrations overall policy was tougher than what Obama had articulated when he ran for president. But the fact remains that Trump had agreed to a meeting before North Korea had taken any concrete steps toward ridding itself of nuclear weapons. The side-by-side quotes cast Hannity as criticizing Obama for being willing to talk to North Korea while praising Trump for his willingness to do the same thing. The quotations are pretty much accurate. But the image glosses over the different policy preferences of each man at the time Hannity spoke. In 2008, Obama said simply there were no preconditions for a meeting with the leader. In 2018, Trumps administration voiced some relaxation on preconditions, but not a full rejection of them. At the same time, Trump agreed to a meeting before North Korea had done more than agree to hold off on testing during any talks.",1.0,0.5,1.0,0.8,0.3,0.4,0.6,1.0,0.5,Mostly True

Final Rating: Mostly True  ","For every one mile of light-rail track that will be built, 16 miles of new road capacity will be built.","One main criticism about the proposed list of projects aimed at improving transportation throughout the Atlanta region is it doesnt have enough new rail components.In south DeKalb County, some county commissioners and influential leaders have been reluctant to support a 1 percent sales tax to fund the projects because the plan doesnt extend MARTA rail service to the area.The environmentally conscious Georgia Sierra Club went a step further recently when it announced its opposition to the July 31 referendum on the tax. One claim the organizations director made as part of her argument against the referendum seemed worthy of a fact-check.For every one mile of light-rail track that will be built, 16 miles of new road capacity will be built, Colleen Kiernan said in a radio interview with WABE-FMs Denis OHayer.Hmmm. Is that correct? Lets take a ride in search of the truth.The list for the 10-county Atlanta region contains 157 projects, according to the Atlanta Regional Commission, which provided data and analysis to officials involved in putting together the list.The Sierra Club sent PolitiFact Georgia a spreadsheet with about 70 projects that would increase the number of lanes of some roads or make them longer. Some of the road projects on the list include: The road projects would increase capacity by 367 miles, ARC says.By comparison, there are three confirmed light-rail projects on the list: along the Atlanta Beltline, the Atlanta streetcar and a line on Clifton Corridor from the Lindbergh Center in Atlanta to Emory University in DeKalb County. A proposed rail line from Cobb County to Midtown Atlanta would need federal funding and is not currently considered a light-rail project.The referendums supporters say the lack of light or heavy rail in the plan is not a lack of will, but a matter of math. The light rail on the Beltline and Clifton Corridor is expected to cost about $1.3 billion, or about $60 million a mile. The referendum is projected to raise about $8.5 billion over the life span of the tax, 10 years.Jane Hayse, ARCs transportation division chief, said the light-rail projects are 21 miles combined.So what about the Sierra Clubs calculation of a 16-to-1 ratio of road projects to light rail? According to ARC, there are 17.5 miles of increased road capacity in the plan for each mile of proposed light rail.Mathematically, it is accurate, Hayse told us. However, the comparison is erroneous. It compares apples to bananas.Hayse said in order to fairly fact-check the Sierra Clubs claim, you must consider all the additional bus projects in the plan. The list includes express bus service in portions of the region and $100 million for bus service in Clayton County, which ended its bus operations a few years ago due to budget cuts. In all, ARC said there is an additional 371 miles of bus service on the list.ARC spokesman Jim Jaquish said the organization will not take a position on the referendum because it is a nonprofit that receives taxpayer dollars. Jaquish did say ARC believes the list is made up of sound, needed projects.Hayse said express bus service is more logical for some parts of the Atlanta suburbs because people do not live and work as closely together as they do in the city. Hayse said rail stations are typically three miles apart, whereas express bus service has longer distances between stops.Light rail just doesnt make sense for the whole region, she said.Kiernan countered that bus service is not a sure thing, noting that Clayton Countys bus service, C-Tran, was discontinued.Our argument is that the amount of fixed, permanent transit infrastructure that we know will be built by the tax is overwhelmed by the amount of fixed road infrastructure we know will be built, Kiernan wrote via email. Traditional express and local bus service is a completely different animal ... and the suggestion that miles of bus service is somehow equivalent to miles of permanent fixed-guideway infrastructure is highly misleading.Kiernans claim is essentially correct. But it needs a bit of context to move higher on the Truth-O-Meter.Under our rating system, Kiernan gets a Mostly True.",1.0,0.5,1.0,0.8,0.0,0.3,0.4,1.0,0.7,Mostly True

Final Rating: Half True  ",Why is January 8th an important date in American history? This day in 1835 is the only day in our history when we have not been in debt.,"U.S. Sen. George LeMieux,R-Fla.,has joined the ranks of politicians experimenting with Twitter. LeMieux, who was appointed last year to fill the unexpired term of Sen. Mel Martinez, has sent Twitter messages with his thoughts on health care reform (neither 'comprehensive' nor 'reform'), his whereabouts (visiting our military installations tomorrow) and now, U.S. trivia. Why is January 8th an important date in American History, LeMieux asked during the afternoon of Jan. 8, 2010. This day in 1835 is the only day in our history when we have not been in debt. We've all seen pictures of the national debt clock, which is now spinning past $12.3 trillion. In fact, LeMieux has it running on a computer monitor posted outside his Washington office, and mentioned the debt on his first day as a senator. We wondered, was there actually a time, one time, when the clock struck zero? First, just so no one gets confused: Debt does not equal deficit. Deficit is the difference in the money the government takes in and what it spends each year. Debt is accumulated deficits, plus interest. You'd think the United States would have been founded with zero debt. But not so, says the Bureau of Public Debt. The government office, which is under the U.S. Department of the Treasury, says the United States had more than $75 million in outstanding American Revolutionary War debts when the nation was created. From there, the national debt grew some and shrunk some before ballooning to $127 million as a result of the War of 1812. The debt then started a steady 20-year decline, which you can see for yourself here. By Jan. 1, 1833, the national debt stood at $7 million. On Jan. 1, 1835, under President Andrew Jackson, the debt was just $33,733. On Jan. 8 of that year, Jackson proclaimed that the last installment of the national debt had been paid. Jackson had called the debt a national curse when he ran for president in 1824. The Payment of the Public Debt, Jackson wrote in a toast at a party that also marked the anniversary of the Battle of New Orleans (another good day for Jackson, who as general, led U.S. troops to victory). Let us commemorate it as an event that gives us increased power as a nation, and reflects luster on our federal Union, of whose justice, fidelity, and wisdom it is a glorious illustration. According to the 1860 biography Life of Andrew Jackson written by James Parton, Jackson vetoed bills that appropriated money for infrastructure projects, thus quickening the pace that the country's debt was retired by up to five years. It was one of the cornerstones of his administration, said Parton, who added that Jackson thought it his most glorious achievement. But did it actually happen on Jan. 8? Jackson biographer Robert Vincent Remini said in his book The Life of Andrew Jackson that the extinguishing of the national debt nearly coincided with the anniversary of the Battle of New Orleans, which falls on Jan. 8. That would at least suggest the actual payment may have occurred a few days sooner. Remini doesn't get into more detail. Other accounts, like H.W. Brand's Andrew Jackson, His Life and Times, say the country was debt free closer to Jan. 1, 1835. For its part, the Bureau of Public Debt says that the national debt reached zero on Jan. 8, 1835, a Thursday. LeMieux's office provided PolitiFact with some additional examples (here and here) documenting the U.S. being debt free on Jan. 8, 1835. After Jan. 8, history writers fail to track the debt with precise detail. Jackson biographers Parton and Remini don't discuss how long the national debt remained zero. (In their defense, they use their ink discussing an assassination attempt on Jackson at the end of January 1835). The Bureau of Public Debt also appears fuzzy on how long America was debt free. All the government group notes is that it wasn't long. We talked to Robert E. Wright, a political economy professor and author of One Nation Under Debt: Hamilton, Jefferson, and the History of What We Owe. He offered a couple of caveats to this talk about the national debt. Even though the United States was considered debt free, the government still had outstanding loans, Wright said.No one asked for the loans to be paid offhowever, and the federal government had the money in the bank to pay them if they were. Wright said the country remained debt free for some time -- much longer than a day -- as politicians argued over what to do with government surpluses. There wasn't a desire to invest in corporations, Wright said. But there were schemes afloat to divide the money up and give it to the states. Financial panics made those discussions irrelevant. By Jan. 1, 1836, the national debt had grown back to $37,000, according to the Bureau of Public Debt. A four-year depression starting in 1839 resulted in the debt growing to $20 million. Then, it was off to the races. The debt was more than $2.6 billion by the end of the Civil War; almost $27 billion by the end of World War I, and almost $260 billion by the end of World War II. The debt reached $1 trillion in Ronald Reagan's first term as president. It reached $5 trillion near the end of Bill Clinton's first term. LeMieux says that the United States was only debt free for one day in its history -- Jan. 8, 1835. He's right that the United States was indeed debt free on that day. And before and after that, we as a country really never got that close to being debt free. Did it last only one day, however, as LeMieux says? We found this day in history stories and blogs that tend to suggest so. But LeMieux's office didn't offer any definitive proof. Jackson biographers don't note it that way. Neither does the government office that tracks the debt. Scholars also say it lasted much more than a day. And since Jackson was bent on retiring the debt, we'd at least expect him to spend a day or two with an empty credit card account before racking up a bill again.",0.5,0.5,1,0.5,0,0,0.5,1,0.5,Half True

Final Rating: Mostly True",Took on the Olympics and turned them around,"In February 1999, Romney was called on to help bail out an Olympic effort that was marred by scandal. Sponsors wondered if they still wanted their names attached to the Games after it was revealed that Salt Lake City's host committee had showered gifts on the international group that had chosen the location. Investigations were underway. The Olympics were in serious trouble. Still, Romney's implication that he single-handedly rescued the Games is a sore subject in Utah. Robert Garff, chairman of the Salt Lake organizing committee and a supporter of Romney's presidential bid, says Romney's commercial does overstate the problem. Garff says that contrary to Romney's ad, the Olympics were not bankrupt before he arrived. In addition, many of the Games' sponsors predated Romney's involvement, said Sydney Fonnesbeck, a former member of the Salt Lake City Council. He just came in and gathered the money that was already (pledged), she said. Fonnesbeck said Romney alienated some people with whom he worked during the Games. He didn't want to give anyone else any credit, she said. We became nobodies. A lot of us were hurt and angry. It didn't surprise any of us when he ran home and ran for governor. And yet, Romney did play a decisive role in righting the troubled Olympics. Richard Pound, a Montreal attorney and a member of the International Olympic Committee, said someone had to take charge and make decisions or the Games would have been a disaster. That's what Romney did. There were good people in the organization, but for them to have been able to do the many things that needed to be done, they needed a good leader who could make decisions and empower them, Pound said. Romney scored a big win early in his effort to preserve the Olympic luster by helping to convince John Hancock to remain a sponsor. Stephen A. Greyser, a professor emeritus at the Harvard Business School and a specialist in sports marketing, said the Olympic brand itself had been at stake. It was Mitt Romney who was, in essence, Mr. Integrity, Greyser said. In the end, we cannot award a fully True ruling to Romney's claim when even his supporters say his claim is a little overstated. But there is nothing to dispute that Romney played a vital role in rescuing a very troubled Olympic games and that's why we're rating his claim Mostly True.",0.7,0.5,0.9,0.5,0.3,0.4,0.6,0.8,0.6,Mostly True

Final Rating: Mostly True  ",Says a Republican-drawn map of proposed U.S. House districts for Texas gerrymanders more than nine million Latinos in Texas to make sure that we have no more electoral opportunity than we did in 1991.,"A lawyer viewing a proposed Republican redo of congressional districts laid out in late May saw no additional gains for Hispanic representation even though 65 percent of the state's growth over the past decade was comprised of Latinos.Nina Perales, vice president of litigation for the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund, said in a May 31 press release that the map just unveiled by Republican legislators gerrymanders more than nine million Latinos in Texas to make sure that we have no more electoral opportunity than we did in 1991.Thats a heavy charge considering Latino population growth has been key to the state gaining six U.S. House seats since the 2000 census.Is MALDEFs claim accurate?Lets start with a dash of law and a 20-year flashback.As noted in a February draft report by the Texas Legislative Council, U.S. Supreme Court decisions bar any state from drawing congressional districts intentionally diluting the voting strength of members of a racial or ethnic minority group.The Voting Rights Act of 1965, amended in 1982, is the most important law protecting the voting rights of racial and ethnic minority groups, the report says, because of provisions requiring certain jurisdictions, including Texas, to obtain prior federal approval of any redistricting plan. The act also allows members of a racial or language minority group to challenge a plan limiting or diminishing their opportunity to participate in elections and to elect candidates of their choice.Redistricting expert Justin Levitt, a professor at Loyola Law School, told us the court has interpreted the act to mean jurisdictions must protect the voting power of a group of racial and ethnic minorities if its large enough, compact enough and cohesive enough--and would not be able to exercise political power if the electoral process was left to its own devices.Now, the flashback: Lawmakers in 1991 designed two of three added House districts as opportunity districts giving Latino voters a good shot at electing candidates of their choice. Frank Tejeda, a Democratic state senator, then captured the San Antonio-rooted 28th district, while voters in Houstons 29th district advanced another senator, Democrat Gene Green.Texas wound up with seven Latino-opportunity districts, a number that did not change after last decades redistricting.How do those opportunity districts shake out under the map offered in May?For starters, the map breaks up the state into 36 districts, counting four districts gained courtesy of population increases this past decade. Two new districts, one in the Houston area, the other in Dallas-Fort Worth, are not considered minority-opportunity districts.Another, the 34th district, stretches from Brownsville in Cameron County to Hidalgo County north toward Corpus Christi and is 82 percent Hispanic. But observers do not view the district as a Latino-opportunity gain; its a swap for the current Latino-opportunity district rooted in Corpus Christi and carried in 2010 by Republican Blake Farenthold.Then again, the remap includes the new 35th district running from East Austin into San Antonio. Its overall population is 63 percent Hispanic, according to information compiled by the legislative council; 45 percent of its 2010 registered voters had Spanish surnames. Perales told us Latino voters could elect the candidate of their choice in the district.This appears to give the state an additional Latino-opportunity district compared with 1991.Not so, Perales said, because its offset by redraws of San Antonios 20th district and the 23rd district stretching west from San Antonio that dilute Latino voting power.Among factors she aired: The share of Spanish-surnamed voters in the 20th district, which is represented by Charlie Gonzalez, would drop from 58 percent now to 49 percent. In the 23rd district, where Democrat Rick Noriega bested GOP U.S. Sen. John Cornyn in 2008, Cornyn prevails in the redrawn version.If you create a new opportunity and you take away an opportunity, theres no net gain, Perales said.State Sen. Kel Seliger, R-Amarillo, who chairs the Senate Redistricting Committee, told us lawmakers had to shift Hispanic residents from Gonzalezs district to ensure the new Austin-to-San Antonio district would be a Latino-opportunity district. He urged us to visit further with Austin lawyer Bob Heath, an adviser to the committee.Heath said its hard for legislators to create more Latino-opportunity districts because the Hispanic population is younger than the rest of Texas, and its proportionate share of voting-age residents is smaller. He said too that such residents arent always geographically concentrated and Latino voter registration and turnout tends to run low in part because there are more Latino non-citizens than in other subgroups.Heath said that in his opinion, he said, the 20th district is always going to elect an Hispanic in the Democratic primary and the Democrat is going to win. He declined to comment on the 23rd district.No doubt, appraising opportunity districts is tricky. This is why political scientists get paid every 10 years, for taking all the factors into account and judging districts, Levitt said. Its nuanced.Its also subject to legal argument. Courts have been asked to judge the redo of congressional districts that ultimately won legislative approval.Our judgment: If MALDEFs characterizations stick, the May remap promised six to seven Latino-opportunity districts -- at best the same as 1991.But if Republican defenders are correct, the remap offers eight Latino-opportunity districts--a one-seat bump. However, the proportion of Latino-opportunity seats circa 2012--22 percent--would be virtually unchanged in 20 years. Thats because greatly Latino population growth has helped Texas edge to 36 total seats, compared to 30 in 1991.",0.8,0.5,0.9,0.6,0.5,0.4,0.5,0.7,0.6,Mostly True

Final Rating: Mostly True  ",Almost 75 percent of the deaths from COVID-19 in the state of Texas are a result of people contracting COVID-19 who are age 65 and older.,"In a press conference on May 5 in which Gov. Greg Abbott updated his reopening plan to add businesses such as hair salons and gyms, he recommended that at-risk populations remain at home if at all possible and avoid in-person gatherings, such as a church service, funeral or wedding. We strongly encourage at-risk populations to try to watch or participate remotely, remembering this very important point, and that is almost 75 percent of the deaths from COVID-19 in the state of Texas are a result of people contracting COVID-19 who are age 65 and older, Abbott said. Texas was among the first states to start reopening businesses and lifting restrictions put in place to curb the spread of the coronavirus, allowing retail stores and restaurants to open May 1 at 25 percent capacity. Abbott announced the latest set of reopenings Monday, expanding restaurant capacity to 50 percent and granting bars the ability to open at 25 percent capacity within the next couple weeks. This comes as the state continues to see its number of infections and deaths rise and clusters form mostly in rural parts of the state where meatpacking plants are located. Hospitalizations, however, have decreased since mid-April. With that in mind, we had to ask: Is Abbott right that almost 75% of coronavirus deaths in Texas are people older than 65? Looking at the numbers Abbotts spokesman John Wittman said Abbotts claim is based on figures from the Texas Department of Health Services, which publishes daily numbers on the states COVID-19 testing and cases. The data includes a breakdown of coronavirus deaths by age, race and gender, but only for those cases where the deaths have been investigated by the local and regional health departments. As of Wednesday, the majority, or 489, were still under investigation. The demographic data on cases and fatalities come from the case investigation forms submitted by local health departments and our regional offices, said DSHS spokesman Chris Van Deusen. The purpose of the investigation is to confirm that the person had COVID-19 but also to collect other details about them and the circumstances around their death, Van Deusen said. Wittman said the data showed that 75% of investigated deaths were people 65 and older when Abbott made this statement. It alternates almost daily, but its generally around that range, Wittman said. As of May 6, the day after the press conference, the death toll in Texas was 948. Fewer than half, or 433, had been investigated. Of those, about 71 percent were Texans 65 and older. It was still about 71 percent, or 345 out of 489 investigated cases, as of Wednesday. The age groups broke down like so: Ages 10 to 19 years old: 2 deaths, or 0.4% Ages 20-29: 10 deaths, or 2.04 % Ages 30-39: 9 deaths, or 1.8% Ages 40-49: 21 deaths, or 4.29% Ages 50-59: 54 deaths, or 11.04% Ages 60-64: 45 deaths, or 9.2% Ages 65-69: 59 deaths, or 12.06% Ages 70-74: 45 deaths, or 9.2% Ages 75-79: 45 deaths, or 9.2% Ages 80+: 196 deaths, or 40.08% Across the United States, about 79% of coronavirus deaths have been people 65 years and older, according to the National Center for Health Statistics data submitted between the beginning of February to the beginning of May. Like Texas statistics, the national numbers are also incomplete. The number of deaths represent only those entered between those dates and only include people with confirmed or presumed COVID-19. While 80% of deaths are electronically processed and coded by NCHS within minutes, most deaths from COVID-19 must be coded by a person, which takes an average of 7 days, the NCHS states on its website. The data is also always somewhat behind because of the lag time between when a death occurred and when a death certificate is completed, submitted to NCHS and processed for reporting purposes. The delay can last anywhere from one week to eight or more. Our ruling Abbott said almost 75 percent of the deaths from COVID-19 in the state of Texas are a result of people contracting COVID-19 who are age 65 and older. Of confirmed coronavirus deaths, close to 75% were people within the age group Abbott provided, but he failed to include the caveat that this statistic leaves out more than half of the total deaths that have not yet been investigated.",0.8,0.4,1.0,0.6,0.0,0.2,0.5,1.0,0.4,Mostly True

Final Rating: Mostly True  ","At Twin River, we're more than competitive with nearby casinos in slot machine payouts.","Earlier this month, Gov. Lincoln Chafee expressed the fear that trying to cull too much revenue from the state's slot parlors could send gamblers to other states, where the odds might be better.They are not going to play if they are going to keep losing, Chafee said. They'll go across the border, or go somewhere else where the odds, if you will, are more in their favor.  They know where they have a better chance of winning.In response, Patti Doyle, spokeswoman for Twin River, one of Rhode Islands two slot parlors, said in a radio interview that her casino gives better odds.We know from the industry standards in the industry casino world, that we're all pretty much on the same level. You know, you wouldn't be able to continue to be in business if you weren't competitive with gaming venues that are nearby. And we are. We're more than competitive, she said on radio station WPRO (630-AM).When we hear more than competitive, we think better.So we asked Doyle for the source of that comparison. While we awaited her response, we started our own research.On its website, RILot.com, the Rhode Island Lottery publishes a monthly list of how much cash was put into Twin Rivers 4,700 slot machines, how much cash was won, and how much that represents in percentage.(It should be noted that neither Twin River, nor Newport Grand, the states other slot parlor, sets the payout percentages of their slot machines. Theyre set by the director of the Rhode Island Lottery, Gerald S. Aubin.)Statistics for Connecticut's two casinos -- Foxwoods Resort Casino and Mohegan Sun -- are on the website of the Connecticut Division of Special Revenue at CT.gov/DOSR.At first glance, it looks like Rhode Island is less than competitive. During the period from January 2010 through January 2011, the highest monthly Twin River payout to gamblers was 91.529 percent, in December. The highest payout percentage at the Newport Grand, was lower: 91.171 percent in September.In contrast, the payouts at Foxwoods are listed as higher for 11 of the last 12 months. And Mohegan Sun offered a bigger payout every month, going no lower than 91.80 percent last May and as high as 92.17 in August.But George Papanier, CEO of Twin River, said the published percentages aren't comparable because states calculate the payout percentage differently.The issue is the credits that players get, also known as free play. Rhode Island calls it Bonus Play. Mohegan lists it as eBonus Credits. In the Foxwoods report it's called Free Play. The two states account for it differently, said Papanier. Officials at the Rhode Island Lottery told us the same thing.As a result, the payout percentage for Foxwoods and Mohegan Sun is inflated, they said.In order to calculate the Cash Won at each Connecticut casino the same way it is calculated in Rhode Island, you must take the handle  (the amount played, including free play and winnings replayed), subtract the Win amount (how much the casino wins) and subtract the value of the Free Play or eBonus coupons redeemed at the slot machines.By that formula, we discovered that, as Doyle said, Twin Rivers payout percentage is better than Foxwoods. In every month over the past year, Twin River had a higher payout percentage. The one-year averages: 91.366 percent for Twin River and 90.768 percent for Foxwoods.The story is a little different for Mohegan Sun. It beat out Twin River in 7 of the past 12 months, but the Connecticut casino's 12-month average was a hair below Twin River's, at 91.359 percent. A few tenths -- or hundredths -- of a percent may not seem consequential, but to serious gamblers, any tilt in their advantage is attractive, maybe even enough to send them to one casino over another.To double-check our numbers, we talked to Michael Janusko, chief financial examiner of Connecticut's Division of Special Revenue, who confirmed that our calculations were correct. The way Foxwoods and Mohegan Sun run their numbers, it does overstate the payout percentage a bit, he said.Finally, Doyle sent us a copy of The Gaming Industry Observer's East Coast Slot Report that summarizes casino operations from Maine to Florida in January. Twin River ranked 13th out of 56 facilities in terms of money paid out to players, ahead of Mohegan Sun (25th), Newport Grand (26th), and Foxwoods (35th).Aubin, Rhode Island's Lottery director, said there is an important caveat to understand when considering payout. Those percentages are largely a function of the types of machines a casino has, not whether it is actually giving gamblers better odds.All other things being equal, a facility that has lots of penny slots, for example, will have a lower overall payout percentage than a casino that has none because those machines have smaller payouts.I'm confident it would be the exact same payout throughout the country with the same game, he said.To summarize: Looking at the casinos as a whole, the way Foxwoods and Mohegan Sun calculate their payout percentages may make them look like a better bet for gamblers. But if you include player rewards to make an apples-to-apples comparison, Doyle's statement that Twin River is more than competitive is true for Foxwoods. Whether it applies to Mohegan Sun depends on the month.",1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.5,1.0,1.0,Mostly True

Final Rating: True  ","Says that in three legislative sessions, his proposals opening pre-kindergarten to all Texas 4-year-olds never got heard or voted out of committee.","Some 181,000 Texas 4-year-olds were enrolled in state-backed pre-kindergarten in 2008-09, according to the National Institute for Early Education Research, making the state No. 1 in the number of 4-year-olds attending public-school pre-K. Separately, the Texas Public Policy Foundation has estimated that 85 percent of the state's 4-year-olds are in a public or private pre-K program. The pre-K program funded by the state mostly serves children whose families live at or near the federal poverty level — an eligibility limit that state Sen. Rodney Ellis wants to erase in hopes, he says, of helping more children succeed in school. A 2006 study by researchers at Texas A&M University concluded that permitting all 4-year-olds to enter high-quality, full-day pre-K classes, in public or private settings, would deliver benefits greatly exceeding costs. The study took into account factors including educational outcomes, increased future earnings and reduced child welfare, child care, justice system and crime victims' costs. Ellis, D-Houston, filed proposals to open pre-K to all 4-year-olds in the 2005, 2007 and 2009 legislative sessions, but nothing happened, he complains. The May 14 issue of The Texas Observer quotes Ellis saying: Ive never gotten it out of committee or gotten a hearing. We wondered if Ellis accurately recapped the fate of his proposals. First, some background on this issue. Like most states, Texas limits pre-K eligibility to targeted groups. For starters, children have to be at least 3 years old to qualify. Until recently, they also had to be homeless or unable to speak and comprehend English or educationally disadvantaged — a characterization based on family income. Since 1985, state law has required any district with at least 15 eligible 4-year-olds to offer half-day pre-K, which is supported by state education aid. Districts that offer full-day programs must fund them by charging parents tuition or using other resources including state early-start grants, according to a 2010 report by the House Research Organization. The state put nearly $777 million into pre-K classes in 2008-09, according to the Texas Education Agency. With an assist from Ellis's office, we confirmed from legislative records that for each of the three sessions, Ellis filed his pre-K bill and it failed to win a hearing or be voted out of committee. In 2005 and 2007, identical House measures likewise languished. Still, we wondered if that inaction reflects lawmakers' indifference to early childhood education in general, or simply the three proposals by Ellis. Has any House or Senate member succeeded in winning consideration—or adoption—of measures widening pre-K access? Texas experts on pre-K told us that in 2006 and 2007, the Legislature took steps intended to expand access. In 2006, legislators agreed to a move by Sen. Leticia Van de Putte, D-San Antonio, to allow toddler dependents of adults on active military duty into pre-K; the expansion was rolled into a measure focused on education and school property taxes, according to Ida Garcia, Van de Puttes legislative director. In 2007, Garcia said, Van de Putte was among backers of a move to ensure pre-K eligibility for all children who had ever been in foster care became law. Previously, she said, children in foster care were permitted into pre-K classes but if they were later adopted, they could be barred. Pre-K experts noted too that legislators last year sent Gov. Rick Perry a proposal by Rep. Diane Patrick, R-Arlington, that directed $25 million to support full-day pre-K classes in school districts that adopted specific pre-K class-size limits and teacher-student ratios, among requirements. But Perry vetoed that bill, saying the money should be spent instead on existing grants enabling select districts to expand half-day classes to full-day offerings -- serving more students with greater needs, or 21,000 more students than would have been served under the vetoed proposal, the governor said. So how does Ellis statement shake out? Hes right that his proposals to open pre-K to all 4-year-olds never drew a hearing or advanced from committee. But a few efforts to expand eligibility for — or enhance — pre-K offerings have succeeded or won wide consideration.",1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,True

Final Rating: Mostly True  ","Under economic sanctions, now Iran is suffering 30 percent inflation, 20 percent unemployment.","An Iranian president says hes ready to resolve the nations nuclear standoff with the West — what gives? Former U.S. Labor Secretary Robert Reich gives at least partial credit to economic pain orchestrated by the United States and international allies. While the United States must still be very cautious, he said on ABCs This Week, one of the big lessons here is that economic sanctions do seem to work. Right now Iran is suffering 30 percent inflation, 20 percent unemployment, he told a roundtable including CNNs Newt Gingrich, ABCs Jonathan Karl and PBS Gwen Ifill. I mean this nation is hurting and our economic sanctions, because we've been patient with them, because we have actually rounded up almost every other nation to support us, have had a huge impact. Is Iran suffering such high inflation and unemployment under economic sanctions? Tumbling oil exports Now, economic sanctions are nothing new for Iran, which has faced U.S. sanctions since its 1979 Islamic revolution. But the pressure hasbeen rising. Other nations have joined in sanctions since 2006 in response to Irans efforts to develop a nuclear weapon, according to a report byKenneth Katzman of the Congressional Research Service, which provides nonpartisan analysis to Congress. Oil exports, which fund nearly half of Irans government spending, have fallen by about half since 2011, from about 2.5 million barrels a day to about 1.25 million. The drop hasbeen driven, Katzman says, by a European Union embargo and U.S. pressure on Iranian oil customers. Iran also lost access to the international banking system. The combination has caused a sharp drop in the value of Irans currency, the rial, Katzman says. Meanwhile, sanctions helped trigger a recession thats driving up unemployment. Has that meant 30 percent inflation, 20 percent unemployment, as Reich told ABC viewers? Theres not a simple answer. Inflation estimates range from 30 percent to 70 percent. Official unemployment statistics, meanwhile, are out of date, and outside experts question their accuracy, anyway. The International Monetary Fund, World Bank and Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development dont have up-to-date figures for Iranian unemployment. Still, Reichs in range. Gary Hufbauer, a former U.S. Treasury official and senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics who has studied sanctions for 30 years, said Reichs numbers seem reasonable. Heres how the Congressional Research Service put it in June: Inflation: 30 percent plus, according to Iran Central Bank in May 2013, but believed to be over 50 percent by outside experts. Unemployment rate: Official rate is 15.3 percent as of the end of 2011, but outside experts believe the rate is higher. Reich pointed us to news articles from the Associated Press and energy news site OilPrice.com — which offer some support for his numbers while highlighting the uncertainty. The Associated Press reported in June inflation over 30 percent, though it cited a 14 percent unemployment rate. OilPrices.com noted Sept. 19 that analysts outside the countryfound thatunemployment rate impossible to believe, and quoted an estimate from Mehrdad Emadi, an Iranian-born economic adviser to the European Union, of more than 20 percent. (The OilPrices.com report echoes a Reuters report from the same day.) So reasonable seems like a fair assessment for Reichs numbers. We should also note theres not universal agreement on the size of sanctions role in all that financial pain, which experts also attribute to Irans fiscal management. Reich, a professor of public policy at the University of California at Berkeley with a background in economics, told PolitiFact it just makes sense unemployment and inflation would follow a slash in oil exports. The typical consequence for a nation dependent on exports when those exports are cut is high inflation and high unemployment, he said. Michael Malloy, a professor at the University of the Pacifics McGeorge School of Law who specializes in banking regulation and economic sanctions, told PolitiFact it's likely to be a much more complicated picture. Our ruling Reich told ABC viewers that under economic sanctions, now Iran is suffering 30 percent inflation and 20 percent unemployment. Irans own statistics arent widely trusted and international organizations dont have recent unemployment figures. But those numbers fall within a broad range of expert estimates cited by news reports and the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service. Its worth noting that Irans economic struggle has been exacerbated by its own economic policies and other factors, not just sanctions. Still, theres good evidence theyve had a huge impact, as Reich said.",0.8,0.2,1.0,0.7,0.0,0.1,0.5,0.9,0.6,Mostly True

Final Rating: Mostly True  ",U.S. Sen. Johnny Isakson has voted for $7 trillion of our national debt!,"Libertarian U.S. Senate candidate Allen Buckley knows he faces an uphill battle in his campaign to unseat Republican U.S. Sen. Johnny Isakson. Libertarians usually pull only low single-digits of the overall Georgia voter turnout. And Isakson is a veteran lawmaker and a founding member of the state Republican establishment, which today holds sway over all statewide offices. Buckley ran unsuccessful campaigns for U.S. Senate in 2004 and 2008. But in 2008, he won enough votes in the general election to force a runoff between Republican Saxby Chambliss and Democrat Jim Martin. An Atlanta tax attorney, Buckley thinks he has an issue that will resonate with voters if he can only get them to pay attention and understand the gravitas of the soaring federal debt. U.S. Sen. Johnny Isakson has voted for $7 trillion of our national debt! Buckley states on his website as part of a graphic about Isakson votes to raise the federal debt limit. Is that possible? Has Isakson, who has pushed for a balanced budget amendment and who also blasts the federal debt on his campaign website, actually assisted the spending spree? PolitiFact Georgia decided to take a look. Buckley and Democrat Jim Barksdale will face Isakson in the November election. We first contacted Buckley, who said the graphic refers to Isaksons repeated votes to raise the federal debt limit, which essentially means raising the cap on what the government is permitted to spend to pay the bills. I believe Mr. Isakson has, irresponsibly and immorally, voted to grow the federal government through debt spending to the detriment of young people and our country. Buckley said in an email. He later added: He largely created the mess and then voted to fund what he created. Buckley said Isakson voted for debt-bloating items like the war in Iraq and the Medicare prescription drug benefit and subsequently voted for debt-ceiling increases to cover the cost of the increased spending. Isaksons campaign manager, Trey Kilpatrick, dismissed Buckley assertions, but did not dispute Isaksons vote to raise the debt limit. Mr. Buckley is trying to mislead voters by citing debt ceiling votes (required for solvency) without citing Johnny's votes against trillions of dollars in unnecessary spending, including voting against a minimum of $5 trillion in debt ceiling votes alone, or his vote for the Budget Control Act, which cut spending by over $2 trillion and, according to the Heritage Foundation, 'has shrunk the size of government more effectively than any budget tool in a generation, Kilpatrick wrote in an email. The debate over the federal debt comes at an interesting time. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office earlier this month released a report that warned of vastly increased federal debt when compared to the Gross Domestic Product over the next three decades. Federal debt held by the public was 39 percent of GDP in 2008, but is now about 75 percent, the budget office said. That could rise to 86 percent by 2026 and a whopping 141 percent by 2046. The prospect of such large debt poses substantial risks for the nation and presents policymakers with significant challenges, the budget office warned. The CBO said the governments spending growth is outpacing revenues as spending soars for popular programs like Social Security and Medicare and interest on the governments existing debt. The most popular programs cost a lot to maintain, and neither Democrats nor Republicans want to be blamed for cuts, experts told PolitiFact. PolitiFact consulted political and budget experts across the county. Their verdict: Buckley has a point about Isaksons spending votes, but there is a lot of context missing. University of Virginia political scientist Larry Sabato said many of the most popular federal programs are also the most expensive. That puts politicians of all stripes in a difficult spot. Some, like Social Security, Medicare/Medicaid, Defense spending, interest on the debt etc. are bigger than others, Sabato said. Given that many of these categories are mandatory, its hard to imagine that any member of Congress hasnt cast votes that effectively increase the amount of debt the country incurs. Chris Edwards, an economist with the Cato Institute, said that by voting for debt-limit increases members of Congress have kicked the can down the road on the governments debt problem. Voting for annual deficit-financed budgets causes the accumulated debt to rise, but voting to increase the legal debt limit—as Isakson and others do regularly—ratifies the unsound practice of endlessly spending more than is taken in, Edwards wrote in an email. Kennesaw State University political scientist Kerwin Swint said voting to raise the debt ceiling is not quite the same thing as voting to create new programs or authorize new spending items The alternative to not raising the debt ceiling is shutting down the government, Swint said. Buckleys claim is technically accurate of course but totally misleading, saidAlan Abramowitz, a political scientist at Emory University. Abramowitz said the U.S. should take advantage of extremely low interest rates to borrow more money to invest in much needed infrastructure improvements and other projects. It cannot be emphasized enough that the debt obsession of some conservative politicians and pundits is totally misplaced at a time when the investing community is practically begging to purchase U.S. treasury notes at extremely low interest rates, Abramowitz said.  Our ruling:  Libertarian U.S. Senate candidate Allen Buckley proclaimed on his campaign website: U.S. Sen. Johnny Isakson has voted for $7 trillion of our national debt! Isakson did indeed vote to raise the debt ceiling, so Buckley has a valid point. But the alternative would be risking a government shutdown. That said, Buckley also pointed at that Isakson voted for some of the very programs that bloated the debt in the first place.  https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/678c89f4-52af-4e46-a0c6-780d26e73caf",1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,Mostly True

Final Rating: Mostly True  ","Says under our current sentencing laws, about 75 percent of all convicted felons in Oregon do not go to prison.","Gov. John Kitzhaber recently announced the creation of a new commission to examine the states sentencing laws. Not long after, two advocacy groups released a joint report calling Oregon's Measure 11 ineffective and discriminatory when it comes to the states youth.Mandatory sentencing laws -- ever the point of contention -- are receiving renewed public attention. And in a recent guest column in The Oregonian, three county district attorneys -- including Multnomahs Michael Schrunk -- offered some context, noting this is an issue with which we have great experience and expertise.While expressing some disappointment that the governor was not including elected district attorneys on the commission, the three wrote contrary to popular belief, we do not lock up every convicted criminal. Under our current sentencing laws, about 75 percent of all convicted felons in Oregon do not go to prison. They are put on probation in the community.That statistic caught the eye of at least one reader who asked PolitiFact Oregon to take a look.The DAs said they got that figure courtesy of Oregons Criminal Justice Commission, so thats where we started.It didnt take long before Michael Wilson, the commissions economist, sent us a breakdown of felons and their sentences for 2010.At first blush, it looks like Schrunk and the other DAs -- John Foote of Clackamas and Bob Hermann of Washington -- were right. (It should be noted, nine others endorsed the letter, as well.) Of the 17,622 convicted felons in 2010, just over 4,000 were sent to prison. As a percentage, thats about 23 percent.But, as Craig Prins, the director of the justice commission put it, the simple answer isnt always the most informative answer. There are a few caveats to consider before you go shouting that number from any rooftops.For starters, that 23 percent figure doesnt include the 8 percent of felons who serve state time, but do it in local jails. Those 8 percent serve less than a year, but its still worth noting. Take that into account and at least 30 percent are serving state time -- just not necessarily in a prison.Next, it should be noted that there are different categories of felonies, and as you drill down into them, you start to notice that certain sorts of felons are more likely to receive time in a prison.Of the felons convicted of person crimes (think: robberies, assaults, sex crimes, murder and others), 43 percent go to prison, and another 3 percent spent time in a local jail. For felons convicted of property crimes, 30 percent wind up in prison and another 5 percent in local jails.The overall figure gets pushed down some by drug offenders who are sentenced to prison at a rate close to 8 percent with another 10 percent going to local jails for less than a year. The national rate for the same group is considerably higher, Prins said. In 2006, for instance, nationally drug offenders were being sent to prison about 40 percent of the time, according to a report from the Bureau of Justice Statistics.In Oregon, weve always kind of prided ourselves on the fact that, policy-wise, it does not make sense to put such people in prison, Prins said. Same goes for people who commit lower-level property crimes. Is it worth spending $30,000 to incarcerate somebody who stole $1,000? Prins asked. The priority are those who commit violent crimes.And, indeed, if you exclude drug offenders from the equation, 33 percent of convicted felons serve time in prison while 7 percent serve time in local jails for a total closer to 40 percent.Thats not to say that drug offenses arent felonies -- but its still important context, especially given that the word felony can describe a number of crimes.Theres one last bit to consider: About 69 percent of all convicted felons wind up with probation. But that doesnt mean they get off without serving any time behind bars, which seems to be an implicit part of the DAs critique when they note contrary to popular belief, we do not lock up every convicted criminal.According to Wilson, about 63 percent of the offenders who received a probation sentence in 2010 received a jail sentence as well. The average stay, he said, was just over a month.Put another way, only 25 percent of convicted felons actually manage to avoid time behind bars as part of their sentence. Even then, Charles French, a deputy district attorney with Multnomah County who deals a lot with crime statistics, said hed be surprised if those 25 percent dont serve at least some time in jail, if even a night, after their arrest.I think most people who commit felonies do serve time in jail, he said. But most of them do not serve time in prison. And, frankly, the idea of a jail sanction as a condition of probation is reformatory, in theory.Its important, he added, that the public has access to these sorts of figures, even if they require some context. I think the more information the public has, the better.As for our ruling, the DAs were very specific in their statement that 75 percent of all convicted felons in Oregon do not go to prison. Technically theyre right, but the number of felons the DAs lock up is considerable higher and thats an important piece of missing context.

Final Rating: Mostly True  ",Manufacturing wages today in America on a per-hour basis are actually a bit lower than average wages in the economy as a whole.,"Former car czar Steven Rattner, who actually hates the nickname he earned overseeing the auto bailout, is pushing back against proclamations of a flourishing American manufacturing industry. Again. Rattner wrote an eye-catching New York Times op-ed in January calling the industrys post-recession jobs gains a trickle, arguing we need to get real about the so-called renaissance partly because wages for auto workers andmanufacturersdropped far more than the average private-sector worker since the end of the recession in June 2009. He revisited some of those points in a March 30, 2014, appearance on ABCs This Week, which took a break from coverage of Russia and the missing Malaysian plane to examine the state of Made in the USA. We certainly want these kinds of advanced manufacturing jobs. But remember this, manufacturing wages today in America on a per-hour basis are actually a bit lower than average wages in the economy as a whole, he said. And what I mean by that is there are lots of really good high-paying jobs in sectors like education, like IT, like health care, service sectors that are not just entry-level jobs, they are really high-paying jobs, and this is our competitive advantage. Manufacturing jobs are typically seen as a source of higher pay for people who dont earn college degrees, and President Barack Obama put an emphasis on them in his State of the Union address. So PunditFact wondered if Rattner is right: Are per-hour wages in manufacturing a little smaller than average wages for the rest of the American economy? Rattner pointed to U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics data for average hourly earnings of production and nonsupervisory employees in the private sector, which make up about four-fifths of total private-sector employment. The most recent data for February 2014 shows the average hourly private-sector wage was $20.50. The manufacturing industry average was, as Rattner said, a bit lower at $19.43. Hourly wages are almost $3 higher for employees who produce durable goods, such as cars, phones and computers, than those who make nondurable goods, or things like food, gas and clothes. Weekly wages tell a different story, with manufacturers earning almost $122 more a week than the total worker average in February. The reason for the discrepancy between hourly and weekly wages is simple: Manufacturers work more hours. Anyone can work more hours and make more money, Rattner said. But manufacturers also earn more money an hour when you factor in supervisors. BLS data for February show average hourly earnings are $24.31 for all private-sector employees and $24.72 for manufacturing employees -- the opposite of what Rattner said. Which dataset is better? The question can incite an economists quarrel. Dean Baker, a liberal economist and co-director of the Center for Economic Policy Research, took issue with isolating a dataset that excludes supervisors, saying analysts see the distinction as arbitrary and are increasingly using the whole workforce for their research. The manufacturing industry has a lower percentage of production employees (70.1 percent) than the average for the private-sector workforce (82.7 percent), which accounts for the higher pay when usingRattner's measure, Baker said. Rattner argues viewing the data his way is more representative of the typical workers earnings without being influenced by the top of the pay scale. Another liberal economist and former Obama administration adviser, Jared Bernstein of the Center for Budget Policies and Priorities, faulted Rattner for excluding benefits on top of wages. Manufacturing workers often have benefits, he said. Another BLS source for wage data (yes, there are a lot of them) shows that when looking at total compensation (wages plus benefits), manufacturing workers earn $35.14 an hour, which is higher than the $28.44 average for careers in the service-providing industry and $29.63 for all private-sector workers in December 2013. Since it's widely believed that workers trade off benefit pay for lower wages, it's a mistake to just consider wages in this sort of comparison when you're dealing with an industry that pays benefits (as opposed to say, fast food), Bernstein said. Matthew Lavoie, National Association of Manufacturers spokesman, said 97 percent of the groups 12,000 members provide health insurance. Rattner conceded manufacturers earn more than service-industry workers when benefits are included in his New York Times column. In our interview with Rattner, he anticipated these objections to his claim. But my point remains the same: The perception that manufacturing jobs are better jobs is out of date, Rattner wrote. Note also that over the past year, per-hour wages for all industries rose by 50 cents per hour but in manufacturing, they rose by only 21 cents per hour. The trend is not manufacturing's friend, as my NYT piece pointed out. Our ruling Rattner was careful on This Week to single out data for per-hour wages when he argued manufacturers are not paid as much as the rest of workforce. His claim relies on the most recent data for production workers in the manufacturing industry, who earn about $1 less than the average of their private-sector counterparts. However, factoring in supervisors shows manufacturers make 41 cents more per hour. Adding benefits gives manufacturers more of an edge. We wont take sides and say what dataset we think is best. What we can say is that Rattner makes an accurate point by one measure.",0.8,0.3,1.0,0.7,0.1,0.4,0.5,1.0,0.6,Mostly True

Final Rating: Mostly True  ",Scott Walker cut school funding more per student than any governor in America.,"A TV ad released Aug. 28, 2014 by the Greater Wisconsin Committee, a group funded by labor unions and Democratic ideological groups, starts with three children looking into the camera and each asking: Why? Then an adult narrator says: Why did Scott Walker cut school funding more per student than any governor in America? Where did the money go? To Scott Walker's friends. Walker gave his corporate friends half a billion dollars in tax breaks and giveaways. We've already rated False an earlier Greater Wisconsin Committee claim, that Walker gave $570 million in job-development incentives to his cronies or corporate friends. Much of that money went to firms whose employees have given to Democrats in the past, many of the donations were small and Walkers jobs agency has a limited role in dealing with firms associated with a big chunk of the $570 million. But what about the claim of Walker cutting school funding, on a per-student basis, more than any other governor? What we know There's no dispute that shortly after taking office in January 2011, Walker made a dramatic reduction in school funding. The $1.2 billion in reductions included $792 million in direct state aid to kindergarten-through-12th grade schools, which is the focus of the new Greater Wisconsin Committee ad. But that fact-check didn't calculate the K-12 school cuts on a per-student basis in comparison to other states. And Walker later restored some of the state aid to schools. The committees evidence Before we dig in, a few words about wording. The Greater Wisconsin Committees claim refers to funding of public schools. But, as well see, the evidence the committee cites is overall spending by the schools -- in other words, what was spent in total from state, federal and local money. So, in addition to checking the overall spending figures the committee cited to us in support of its claim, well examine state revenue figures -- the amount of money given to public schools strictly from the state. What the Greater Wisconsin Committee cited is a table from a solid source, the latest annual report from the U.S. Census Bureau comparing all 50 states (and the District of Columbia) on public school financing. Issued in May 2014, the report covers the Wisconsin state fiscal year of 2011-12, which is the first full fiscal year during Walkers term in office. (The states fiscal year runs from July 1 through June 30; in other words, roughly the same as the traditional school year.) On a percentage basis, Wisconsins reduction in overall per-pupil spending -- of state, federal and local money -- was at the top of the chart when compared with the previous year. In terms of cuts, here are the top five:  State/District Per-pupil SPENDING in 2011-12 from ALL sources Change from 2010-11  Wisconsin $11,042 -6.2 percent Florida $8,372 -5.8 percent District of Columbia $17,468 -5.4 percent Texas $8,261 -4.7 percent South Dakota $8,446 -4.1 percent  In contrast, the census report shows that in the four years before Walker took office, Wisconsins per-student spending rose -- by 3.6 percent in 2010-11, 2.6 percent in 2009-10, 3.7 percent in 2008-09 and 4 percent in 2007-08. In terms of blaming Walker for the cuts, the governor, along with the Republican-controlled Legislature, had direct control over state money, which amounted to 48 percent of the spending by Wisconsin schools in 2011-12. Through the Act 10 collective bargaining reform law, Walker and the Legislature required employees to pay more toward their pension and enabled school districts to charge employees more for health insurance as a way to offset some of the state aid cuts. But as we noted in rating the biggest cuts in state history claim, the Greater Wisconsin Committees statement was not about net impact, just the state funding side of the equation. Walker and the Legislature also had significant influence over local funding, which amounted to 44 percent of the schools spending, because they essentially froze the amount of property tax revenue that local school districts could raise. Walker had no real control over federal funding, which amounted to 8 percent of total spending by Wisconsin schools. Other measures Now, using the same census report, lets look at the revenue figures, focusing on how much state money went to Wisconsin schools. Once again, Wisconsin was at the top in terms of cuts.  State Per-pupil REVENUE in 2011-12 from STATE GOVERNMENT Change from 2010-11  Wisconsin  $5,544 -8.33 percent Idaho $4,630 -6.79 percent Arizona $3,018 -6.46 percent Wyoming $9,466 -5.05 percent Florida $3,273 -4.84 percent  So, the state revenue measure also supports the Greater Wisconsin Committee claim. But there some newer figures available. A May 2014 report from the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a liberal think tank in Washington, D.C., examined state funding of schools in 2013-14. Those figures show Wisconsin was among 15 states that reduced state per-student spending from the previous year. Wisconsin's 0.6 percent reduction (adjusted for inflation) wasnt the largest cut, but rather the third-smallest. (Alaskas 3.2 percent cut was the largest.) Wisconsin state funding was $5,747 per student in 2013-14, versus $5,783 the previous year. As for comparing states on school funding for the entirety of Walkers term, those figures simply arent available yet. Our rating The Greater Wisconsin Committee said: Scott Walker cut school funding more per student than any governor in America. Based on the latest census figures, for 2011-12, the Wisconsin cuts were the largest based on two measures -- state revenue provided to local schools and overall spending by schools of state, federal and local money. But more recent figures indicate that Wisconsins school spending cuts are no longer the largest, at least for a more recent period. For a statement that is accurate but needs additional information, our rating is Mostly True.",0.7,0.5,1.0,0.6,0.0,0.3,0.5,0.5,0.4,Mostly True

Final Rating: Half True  ",Says Hillary Clinton is the one that labeled African-American youth as superpredators.,"In response to Donald Trump calling Hillary Clinton a bigot this week, GOP chairman Reince Priebus reminded people that Hillary Clinton once referred to African-American youth as superpredators.  Priebus took a swing at Hillary Clintons past, telling NBCs Meet the Press host Chuck Todd that her actions say a lot about her, adding shes the one that labeled African-American youth as superpredators. Trump, who is looking to increase his appeal among African-American voters, made the same superpredator claim days earlier on Twitter.  It didnt take long to find what Trump and Priebus were referencing, but for this fact-check, we wanted to take a close look at the full context of Clintons remark. Superpredators in context The superpredators line comes from a 1996 speech in New Hampshire, where Clinton spoke in support of the 1994 Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act, which her husband, Bill Clinton, had signed in to law. Were making some progress, Clinton said. Much of it is related to the initiative called community policing. Because we have finally gotten more police officers on the street. That was one of the goals that the president had when he pushed the crime bill that was passed in 1994. Provisions of the act included a ban on some assault weapons, more funding for community policing and an expansion of the death penalty. The legislation, which was championed by Bill Clinton as a way to reduce the number of African-Americans being killed in drug-related incidents, has drawn criticism in recent years for sending disproportionate numbers of African-Americans to prison. The superpredator remark, which Priebus and Trump referenced, was in the same speech a few lines later. But we also have to have an organized effort against gangs, Hillary Clinton said in a C-SPAN video clip. Just as in a previous generation we had an organized effort against the mob. We need to take these people on. They are often connected to big drug cartels, they are not just gangs of kids anymore. They are often the kinds of kids that are called superpredators — no conscience, no empathy. We can talk about why they ended up that way, but first, we have to bring them to heel. The full context of this incident does link children and superpredators, but nowhere in the speech does she directly label African-American youth this way. However, backlash from this speech has followed Clinton into this years election. Two Black Lives Matter activists confronted Clinton at a private fundraiser in February, telling the candidate she owes black people an apology. One day after this confrontation, Clinton released a statement to the Washington Posts Jonathan Capehart, expressing regret for her word choice. Looking back, I shouldn't have used those words, and I wouldn't use them today, she said. Later in the election cycle, former Democratic opponent, Bernie Sanders, also criticized her language at a debate in Brooklyn. When Sanders was asked by debate moderator why he called out Bill Clinton out for his defense of Clintons use of the term superpredator, Sanders responded, Because it was a racist term, and everyone knew it was a racist term. Our ruling Priebussaid Hillary Clinton is the the one that labeled African-American youth as superpredators. Clinton — in the midst of championing her husbands 1994 crime legislation — did use the term superpredator when referring to gangs of kids. She did not specifically label superpredators as African-American, but the context of her speech and her subsequent apology decades later suggests it was a reasonable inference.",0.5,0.5,1,0.5,0,0,0.5,1,0.5,Half True

Final Rating: Mostly True  ","Eliminating earmarks would make barely a drop in the bucket with regard to the national debt, the deficit.","When he announced May 12, 2008, that he was seeking the Libertarian Party nomination for president, former GOP Rep. Bob Barr of Georgia blasted his former party for running up the federal budget deficit during the last eight years. Barr added that he wasn't about to give likely Republican presidential nominee Sen. John McCain any reprieve merely because the Arizona senator is a longtime opponent of so-called pork barrel spending. Opposition to earmarks – line items in the federal budget directed to local and state projects – while a positive, isn't enough, says Barr. Eliminating earmarks would make barely a drop in the bucket with regard to the national debt, the deficit, he said after announcing his candidacy at the National Press Club in Washington. As it turns out, Barr's right on the money about how little earmarks have contributed to expanding the national debt. While earmarking has become an easy focal point for fiscal conservatives concerned about the budget deficit, which is now more than $9-trillion in total, having added another $163-billion plus interest in 2007, it's only a small part of the problem. According to an Office of Management and Budget tally, earmarks totaled $17-billion in fiscal 2007, only about 10 percent of the deficit that year. Admittedly, that's after earmarking dropped considerably following the congressional lobbying scandals of 2005 and 2006. But even at their peak in 2005, when earmarks hit $52-billion, according to the Congressional Research Service and the OMB, that was only 16 percent of that year's deficit of $318-billion. Whether Barr's statement is true or not, then, depends on how you define drop in the bucket. We'd say that Barr's pretty much correct, so we grade his statement Mostly True.

Final Rating: Mostly True  ","The Seminole gambling compact offers $3 billion in guaranteed revenue, the largest share for any state in history.","The Seminole Tribe of Florida is trying to convince the Legislature that approving a new gaming compact is a safe bet. As lawmakers consider a plan negotiated between the Seminoles and Gov. Rick Scott, the tribe has started running commercials with the message that the agreement helps the state. One of the ads ticks off several benefits of the deal Scott has touted to the Legislature, which has been reluctant to agree to the compact. The governor authorized a new and unprecedented Seminole compact: Nearly 20,000 new Florida jobs; $3 billion in guaranteed revenue, the largest share for any state in history; and for the first time, empowering the Legislature to limit expansion to keep Florida's entertainment options family friendly, the commercial said. Thats a lot to pack into one 30-second spot. PolitiFact Florida was especially curious about the $3 billion in payments the tribe promised the state. Is it really the most any state has received from Indian gaming in history? It looks like the odds are in the tribes favor. Reaching an agreement This is a very convoluted subject, but heres a quick-start look at the issue: Since 1988, the U.S. government has allowed federally recognized Indian tribes to run gambling establishments on tribal land. But if a tribe wants to have certain Las Vegas-style games at its casino known as Class III games (blackjack, roulette, slot machines and so forth), it must reach a legal agreement with its state, called a compact. The Seminole tribe reached a deal with then-Gov. Charlie Crist in 2010 that allowed them to operate banked card games — games in which players bet against the house instead of each other — at five of its seven casinos across the state. The Seminoles agreed to pay Florida for exclusive rights to operate these games, plus slot machines at four casinos outside Miami-Dade and Broward counties. These revenues usually amounted to well over $200 million per year for the state. The compact expired in July 2015, with a renewal deadline of Oct. 31, 2015. There hasnt been a new agreement, leading to lawsuits between Florida and the Seminoles over who can operate these games. The tribe continues to operate the Class III games of blackjack, chemin de fer and baccarat at those five casinos without a compact. In December 2015, Scott announced he had formed a new compact with the Seminoles. Among the details in the 20-year deal is a promise that the tribe could expand craps and roulette at their casinos and offer blackjack exclusively for seven years. The tribe would guarantee a minimum of $3 billion in payments to the state over those seven years. The Legislature is considering approving the compact during the 2016 session. On Feb. 9, the House Regulatory Affairs Committee okayed a bill to ratify the compact, but the Senate delayed its vote. Is that $3 billion in guaranteed revenue to Florida the most any state has ever gotten, as the Seminoles commercial says? Its the guaranteed part that tips the tribes hand. Comparing compacts Dozens of Indian tribes have gaming compacts in 26 states, and the details differ not only among states, but among tribes in a given state. While tribes can reach agreements to share revenue with local governments and pay regulatory costs, were just looking at how much states get. Comparing these compacts is a tall order. Given the nature of the industry, casinos are always opening and closing, contract terms are being updated or changed, and the terms of the payments tribes give differ depending on the compact. Thats especially true when considering states like Connecticut, whichreceives a lot of money but bases compact payments on a percentage of casino earnings, or Washington, which negotiated compacts so money goes to local governments instead of the state. The Seminoles currently pay the state quite a bit for a single tribe, which we can illustrate with overall earnings and revenue-sharing figures. In California, for example, tribal casinos make about $7 billion per year, highest in the nation. Of that, they give about $241 million to the state in 2014. (The state had compacts with 73 tribes in 2014, but only 11 of those tribes paid into the general revenue fund.) Tribes in Oklahoma, which generated $3.8 billion in gaming revenues from 124 casinos, paid the state about $125 million in 2013. Florida is in third place for total gaming revenues, with more than $2.3 billion from eight casinos. The Seminoles operate seven of those to make the lions share of the revenue, and as we mentioned, more than $200 million of those revenues go to the state annually. (The Miccosukee tribe, which operates an eighth casino in the Miami area, does not need a compact based on the games it offers.) Robert Jarvis, a law professor at Nova Southeastern University in Fort Lauderdale, said the Seminoles can afford to give the state so much because they enjoy several distinct advantages tribes in other states do not. The Seminoles live on land close to population centers, like the Hard Rock casinos in Tampa and Hollywood. They also dont have to fight with other tribes for customers. It doesnt hurt that this is Florida, where tourists flock and bring gambling money with them. These factors affect how the Seminoles have negotiated with the state. The new Seminole compact offers the guaranteed $3 billion in rising increments, from $325 million the first year up to $550 million in the seventh year. There are other provisions and potential payments in the compact, but that $3 billion is money the tribe has promised to pay no matter what. Even though apples-to-apples comparisons are difficult, by that final year the Seminoles would be paying more than the total any other single state gets from all its tribes. The Seminoles are willing to pay out a lot more than other tribes, Jarvis said, because they want exclusivity in a market that the Legislature could open up to other casino developers. The real question here is not the money, which in a budget as big as Floridas really amounts to a rounding error, he said. Its about expanding gambling in Florida. And if youre for that, the question becomes, who do you want to run the casinos, the Seminoles or someone else? Our ruling The Seminole Tribe of Florida said their new gambling compact offers $3 billion in guaranteed revenue, the largest share for any state in history. The tribe's point about guaranteed compensation over seven years holds up when focused on total dollars. But there's no easy way to make apples-to-apples comparisons of the details between various states and their gaming compacts. Some states have compacts with many other tribes.Some deals call for tribes to split a portion of revenues only with local governments. The takeaway from the ad is Florida is getting the best financial deal of any state in the country, but the finer points aren't clear. We're going to hedge our bets and rate the statement Mostly True.",0.8,0.3,1.0,0.7,0.2,0.4,0.5,1.0,0.6,Mostly True

Final Rating: Mostly True  ","Says President Donald Trump put out a $297 million contract to a vendor to show him how to hire Border Patrol. So, the first payment they made was $14.8 million. You know how many Border Patrol they hired with $14.8 million? Two.","The Trump administration paid a company millions of dollars to help the government hire Border Patrol agents, but only two agents were employed, claimed U.S. Rep. Henry Cuellar, D-Texas. (President Donald Trump) put out a $297 million contract to a vendor to show him how to hire Border Patrol. So, the first payment they made was $14.8 million. You know how many Border Patrol they hired with $14.8 million? Two,  Cuellar said during a Feb. 22 press conference in Laredo, Texas. Were only two Border Patrol agents hired under a $14.8 million initial payment of a $297 million contract? Cuellars broad claim of a troubled hiring process is accurate. But his statement overlooks some details, and the dollar figure he cited is slightly higher than the initial payment. The federal government has had problems finding and keeping people to work as Border Patrol agents, so it decided to turn to the private sector for help. U.S. Customs and Border Protection in November 2017 awarded a $297 million contract to Accenture Federal Services, so it could help the government recruit and hire 7,500 qualified candidates over five years. The jobs to fill are for Border Patrol agents, Customs and Border Protection officers, and Air and Marine Interdiction agents. The Office of Inspector General within the Department of Homeland Security audited the contract in response to hotline complaints about the contract. The inspector generals office in a December 2018 report said that Accenture had not delivered the promised hiring process or results and relied on government resources to fulfill its obligations. It detailed several other concerns. CBP risks wasting millions of taxpayer dollars on a hastily approved contract that is not meeting its proposed performance expectations, the report said. CBP must hold the contractor accountable, mitigate risk, and devise a strategy to ensure results without additional costs to the government. As of Oct. 1, 2018 — 10 months into the contract — Customs and Border Protection had paid Accenture about $13.6 million for startup costs, security requirements, recruiting, and applicant support. In return, Accenture has processed two accepted job offers, the report said. Cuellars office said his claim was based on this finding. The inspector generals office told PolitiFact that those two accepted job offers processed by Accenture were for a Border Patrol agent and for a Customs and Border Protection officer. (CBP officers work at ports of entry and dont necessarily go out on patrol duties.) Customs and Border Protection referred PolitiFact to a statement it issued after the reports publication. While we take some exception to the OIGs characterization of the contract, we do agree the contract has been a challenge, primarily due to the innovative efforts by both parties, and we are reviewing how best to use it moving forward, said part of the statement. The inspector generals report also included Customs and Border Protections response to the audit. The agency said it was inaccurate to say that the $13.6 million only yielded two accepted job offers, because Accenture also created a hiring structure, tailored technology solutions to support and manage the hiring process, stood up an applicant care center, marketed and recruited thousands of new applicants, and conducted many of the hiring steps for several thousand applicants. The inspector generals officer countered that response, saying, While we recognize that CBP has worked with Accenture to establish hiring activities, we stand by our statement that such activities have resulted in only two accepted job offers as of Oct. 1, 2018. One of the issues flagged by the report was a period when neither Accenture nor Customs and Border Protection could determine which applicants were recruited by Accenture, due to Office of Management and Budget restrictions and privacy concerns. Accenture also did not always provide human resource personnel and the people needed to conduct background investigations. And even though Accenture said it could provide an innovative applicant tracking system, it used the governments hiring system instead, the inspector general report said. Due to those shortcomings, the government modified the contract and gave the company a three-month interim period (March through June 2018) to fix those issues. During this period, Customs and Border Protection did a lot of the work Accenture was supposed to be doing. And because Accenture couldnt determine which applicants it recruited, the government agreed to give them credit and temporarily pay Accenture for a percentage of all applicants regardless of whether CBP or Accenture processed the applicants. As of Oct. 1, 2018, CBP had processed 14 applicants on behalf of Accenture. All 14 applicants accepted job offers, and seven of the 14 entered on duty, which translated to payment of approximately $500,000 to Accenture for work CBP had completed, the report said. So, even though there were these additional hires, its unclear if they were employed due to Accentures recruitment efforts. The inspector generals report said Accenture was nowhere near satisfying its 7,500-person hiring goal over the next 5 years. Customs and Border Protection told PolitiFact there were new hires from Accenture brought onboard and others who had accepted job offers since the Oct. 1, 2018 date referenced in the report. Its unclear how many were Border Patrol agents, how many were exclusively recruited and processed by Accenture, and whether they were covered in the initial payment to Accenture. Cuellar said, Trump put out a $297 million contract to a vendor to show him how to hire Border Patrol. So, the first payment they made was $14.8 million. You know how many Border Patrol they hired with $14.8 million? Two. The Trump administration awarded a $297 million contract to Accenture to help Customs and Border Protection hire 7,500 new employees over five years. That includes Border Patrol agents. An inspector general report said that as of Oct. 1, 2018, Customs and Border Protection paid Accenture about $13.6 million for startup costs, security requirements, recruiting, and applicant support. The company to that date had processed two accepted job offers, the report said. One of them was a Border Patrol agent, the other a Customs and Border Protection officer. The report mentioned 14 other accepted job offers processed by Customs and Border Protection on behalf of Accenture. But due to deficiencies in the contract, its unclear if those 14 were hired because of Accentures recruitment.

Final Rating: Mostly True  ",Rick Scott tried to slash school funding by $3.3 billion.,"Both Charlie Crist and Rick Scott will have gubernatorial records to fuel the campaign fire this year. The attacks have already started, with Crist firing a shot about Scotts budget actions over the years. On a page titled Top 5 reasons to make Florida Scott-free, Crist brings up education spending as No. 1. Rick Scott tried to slash school funding by $3.3 billion, the site says. To put that into perspective, $3.3 billion could pay the yearly salaries of more than 70,000 teachers in Florida. Considering Scott came into office during the Great Recession, his budget cutting is well known. We thought wed dive into the numbers to see whether he proposed that the states schools take a $3.3 billion hit. Slash and learn Scott entered office in 2011, facing a $3.6 billion shortfall in the states $70.5 billion budget. His solution in February 2011 was to propose cutting $4.6 billion in spending and $2.4 billion in state revenue by reducing taxes, regulations and fees. His budget came in at $65.9 billion. His proposal, encompassing two fiscal years, recommended cutting per-pupil spending by about $700, a 10 percent reduction from the states current $6,899 spending per student at the time. Part of the cuts included a 10 percent cut in the required local effort portion of property taxes and a loss of more than $870 million in federal stimulus money. In all, that added up to a projected $4.8 billion in cuts to education over the two years. The Scott plan attempted to offset some of those cuts with other federal aid and by requiring teachers to contribute 5 percent to their pension plans, adding back about $400 per student. Weve broken down some of those dollar figures before. In all, funding would have been cut some $3.3 billion the first year. Legislators did not respond well to such a drastic proposed budget reduction for schools. Are we looking at the cuts the governor is making? The answer is no, a resounding no, PreK-12 Education Appropriations subcommittee chairman Sen. David Simmons, R-Altamonte Springs, told the Gainesville Sun. After a contentious session, the Legislature passed and Scott signed a budget that included $1.3 billion in cuts to education, from $18.2 billion to $16.5 billion. The reduction ended up being about $540 per student, a 7.9 percent cut in funding. The following year, Scott requested a $1 billion increase in education dollars, which was included in the 2012-2013 state budget. The increase was needed to make up for more than 30,000 new students and a decline in property taxes from a 3 percent drop in property values. He then requested $1.2 billion more in 2013; the Legislature agreed to $1 billion. This year he has asked Tallahassee for $542 million more for next year, bringing the totals to $10.6 billion in state cash and $18.8 billion overall. This would be a record amount of spending in terms of dollars, but still less than the amount being spent per student when he took office. The ruling Crist said Rick Scott tried to slash school funding by $3.3 billion, pointing to a budget proposal from 2011, Scotts first year in office. Scott did propose cutting $3.3 billion from the education budget, alienating members of his own party in the Legislature in the process. He even had suggested cutting $4.8 billion over two years. Part of the cuts were from the loss of federal stimulus dollars, but the state had the power to restore them had it chosen to. In the end, Tallahassee approved $1.3 billion in cuts. Scott has asked for increases in the three years since. Crists statement was specifically phrased, saying Scott tried to reduce school funding. That is accurate, but its important to note that Scott's initial proposal died in the Legislature, and funding has increased since that attempt.",1.0,0.2,1.0,0.8,0.0,0.3,0.5,1.0,0.7,Mostly True

Final Rating: Mostly True  ","The most recent Associated Press poll has Nader-Gonzalez at 6 percent, without any national coverage, against McCain and Obama.","Perennial presidential candidate Ralph Nader is in an uphill battle for both media coverage and significant poll numbers. But somehow he's managing to get the latter without getting any of the former, he said in a recent radio interview. The most recent Associated Press poll has Nader-Gonzalez at 6 percent, without any national coverage, against McCain and Obama, Nader said during a June 18interviewonDemocracy Now!,an independent, left-leaning radio program. Nader garnered less than half that in the 2000 election and, by many accounts, damaged Al Gore enough to hand George W. Bush the White House. We checkedthe Associated Press pollsand found none that gave Nader 6 percent. The most recent AP poll prior to the interview was an AP-Yahoo poll from April 17 that had Nader at 3 percent. Nader spokesman Chris Driscoll acknowledged the candidate had erred, and said he meant to cite a June 6CNN/Opinion Research Corp. poll, which did indeed have Nader and his running mate Matt Gonzalez at 6 percent against Democratic Sen. Barack Obama, Republican Sen. John McCain and former GOP Rep. Bob Barr, the Libertarian candidate. The finding needs context, though. Was it just an outlier? And what does it say about how Nader will do in November? Other recent polls show Nader with less support.A Rasmussen Reports pollreleased May 18 showed Nader pulling in 4 percent against Obama, McCain and Barr.A Reuters/Zogby pollreleased June 18 showed Nader with 3 percent.A Fox News/Opinion Dynamics pollreleased June 19, the day after Nader's interview, gave him 4 percent. History suggests, however, that even these polls overstate Nader's prospects. At this time in 2000, he was showing around 4 or 5 percent in most national polls, and he ended up with 2.7 percent of the vote. Around this time in 2004, polls had Nader at anywhere from 3 to 7 percent. He got just .38 percent in the end. Now, onto Nader's assertion that his support has come without any national coverage. Clearly he was speaking rhetorically — we found his name mentioned 166 times on the major broadcast and cable news programs between the first of the year and the June 18 interview. But that's six months. Obama and McCain had been mentioned on television about that much in just the previous three days. Nader's coverage had been so slight compared to that of the major-party candidates that we have a hard time holding his hyperbole against him. We are also reluctant to pick on Nader too much for getting the name of a poll wrong. So with the caveat that his claim says little about how he'll do in November, we find it Mostly True.

Final Rating: Mostly True  ",The University of Wisconsin System budget is the biggest it has ever been.,"The 2015-16 academic year ended with pomp, circumstance -- and skirmishes between Gov. Scott Walker and professors in the University of Wisconsin System. Several days later, on May 16, 2016, Walker kept up the offensive in an interview on WTMJ-AM in Milwaukee. We have some of the best schools in the country, no doubt about it, Walker told conservative talk show host Charlie Sykes. But weve got to stop feeding into this national perception that how much you pay in tuition suddenly is a correlation to what the value is. Yeah, you want to have a reasonable level of support for the system; and we do. In fact, by the way, Walker continued, the University of Wisconsin System budget is the biggest it has ever been. The amount of money they get from state government is only a fraction of what they have overall. So, for all this hysteria out there, they have never had more money to spend in the UW System. With the 2015-17 state budget, Walker and his fellow Republicans in the Legislature cut $250 million over the two years from the UW System. That was an 11 percent reduction in state support and a big reason for the no-confidence votes. So, we wondered about Walkers claim that UW Systems budget is the biggest its ever been. Hes essentially correct, but with some caveats. Walker was referring to the systems all-funds budget -- which, as the name suggests, is comprehensive. It includes state tax dollars, but also an array of other funds, such as tuition, revenue from enterprises such as dormitories and athletics, federal research dollars and gifts.  We asked for budget figures from the nonpartisan Legislative Fiscal Bureau for the entire history of the UW System, which began in 1973-'74. Heres a look at the last six years, when the figures were highest. Year All-funds budget -- actual All-funds budget -- adjusted for inflation 2010-11 $5.591 billion $6.077 billion 2011-12 $5.589 billion $5.889 billion 2012-13 $5.901 billion $6.092 billion 2013-14 $5.997 billion $6.101 billion 2014-15 $6.098 billion $6.105 billion 2015-16 $6.194 billion* $6.059 billion As you might expect, the current all-funds budget (2015-16) is the largest on record. But with an asterisk. Thats because in 2015-16, for the first time, the UW System included unspent tuition money carried over from the previous year in its all-funds budget. If that money wasnt included, the 2015-16 all-funds budget would have been $6.059 billion -- the second-highest ever, behind 2014-15, rather than $6.194 billion. Adjusted for inflation -- a better measure for comparing figures over time -- the 2015-16 all funds budget is slightly smaller than in four of the five previous years, but still near the top. State support Walker made it clear his claim was about total funding for the UW System, and that state money covers only a portion of the systems budget. But its worth noting that, adjusted for inflation, state support of the system -- known as general purpose revenue -- is in a historic decline, according to figures from the fiscal bureau. The highest state support, adjusted for inflation, was in the first year of the system, 1973-74 -- at just under $1.52 billion. That figure hit an all-time low of $1.03 billion in 2015-16. UW System officials often cite the reduction in state support because they have generally have more flexibility in spending state tax dollars than with revenues that are designated for certain purposes. Our rating Walker said: The University of Wisconsin System budget is the biggest it has ever been. The systems 2015-16 all-funds budget -- which includes not only state tax dollars but federal funds, tuition and other income -- is $6.194 billion, the biggest since the system was created in 1973-74. But adjusted for inflation, the 2015-16 all-funds budget is among the biggest, though not the biggest. And the 2015-16 figure includes unspent tuition revenue that hadnt been counted in the all-funds budget in previous years. For a statement that is accurate but needs clarification, our rating is Mostly True.",0.8,0.5,1.0,0.7,0.0,0.5,0.4,1.0,0.6,Mostly True

Final Rating: Mostly True","Right now in Ohio 200,000 people are getting opioid treatment because they have insurance under the Affordable Care Act.","The Affordable Care Act is helping people in Ohio get the treatment they need for opioid addiction, said U.S. Sen. Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio. Right now in Ohio 200,000 people are getting opioid treatment because they have insurance under the Affordable Care Act, he said in an April 9 speech to the City Club of Cleveland. This is a common talking point by Brown, who will face the winner of the May 8 Republican primary that features U.S. Rep. Jim Renacci and businessman Mike Gibbons, among other candidates. Ohio is one of the states that expanded Medicaid as part of the 2010 federal health care law, and isone of the hardest hit states in the nation by the opioid epidemic.Experts have said that the program for the poor has helped treat those with opioid addiction. Brown was citing a valid study about the Affordable Care Act, but he didnt precisely explain what the researchers found. We learned itis difficult to pinpoint how many have gotten this type of treatment as a result of the law. Brown cited research by Harvard Medical School. The research, conducted by health economics professor Richard Frank and New York University Dean Sherry Glied, was released in January 2017 when Republicans were vowing to repeal the Affordable Care Act, though that didnt happen. Repealing the ACA — and its behavioral health provisions — would have stark effects on those with behavioral health illnesses, the researchers concluded. Nationwide, the researchers estimated that approximately 1.25 million people with serious mental disorders and about 2.8 million Americans with a substance use disorder, of whom about 222,000 have an opioid disorder, would lose some or all of their insurance coverage if the federal health care law was repealed. In Ohio, the researchers found that 220,512 people with addiction or mental health disorders had coverage under the Affordable Care Act in 2016. (Brown said right now, but this data is two years old.) About151,200 obtained coveragethrough the Medicaid expansion and 69,225 obtained plansthrough the marketplace. While Brown specifically said that 200,000 were getting opioid treatment, the research was more broad, because it addresses addiction and mental health disorders in general. Sometimes Brown has more precisely explained that 200,000 figure, including in a press statement when the study was released. But at other times, he has said that 200,000 Ohioans were getting opioid treatment through the Affordable Care Act. One of the researchers confirmed for PolitiFact that the 220,000 figure referred to significant behavioral health or substance use disorder needs.  The data we had analyzed do not indicate how many in this group used substance use treatment services, said Glied of NYU. Its clear that more broadly, Medicaid expansion has helped Ohioans seek drug treatment. Glied said that about half of all medication-assisted treatment for substance abuse treatment in Ohio is paid by Medicaid. Browns office spokeswoman, Jennifer Donahue, pointed to news reports showing that 500,000 low-income Ohio adults received mental health and addiction services under the states Medicaid expansion, including many for drug addiction. Donahue also cited news reports showing Republican Gov. John Kasich credited the Medicaid expansion for helping treat opioid addicts. Other health care experts, including the Kaiser Family Foundation, have expressed similar views that the Affordable Care Actwill play a key role in tackling the opioid epidemic. Spokespersons for state departments of health, addiction services and Medicaid told us they didnt have any data showing how many Ohioans had received opioid treatment as a result of the Affordable Care Act. However, between the time Ohio expanded Medicaid in 2014 through August 2017, more than 633,000 Ohioans with behavioral health needs had accessed services, including addiction treatment and mental health, throughexpanded Medicaid coverage. But we dont know how many in this group received opioid treatment. The state data suggests that those receiving services may be even higher than the Harvard study, which was based on 2016 data, if we include additional years. Brown said, Right now in Ohio 200,000 people are getting opioid treatment because they have insurance under the Affordable Care Act. Harvard and New York Universityresearchers concluded that about 220,000 people with addiction or mental health disorders had coverage through the Affordable Care Act, either through Medicaid expansion or purchasing insurance on the exchange, in 2016. But Brown oversimplified the study.The statistic is more broad than those who have received treatment for opioid addiction. Other state data suggest the number could be higher than 220,000, if we include multiple years. Browns general point that the Affordable Care Act has benefited people who need opioid treatment is supported by experts.",0.7,0.5,1.0,0.6,0.0,0.3,0.5,0.4,0.5,Mostly True

Final Rating: True  ",Our state transportation department already has a heavy debt load and has paid more than $700 million in debt payments in just the last two years.,"Infrastructure is one of Gov. Mike Parsons top priorities in the 100th legislative session, and some representatives have followed suit. House Budget Chairman Rep. Cody Smith, R-Carthage, presented a budget plan to fund road and bridge improvements throughout the state. Smith said his plan would fund the infrastructure improvements without raising taxes or accruing new debt. Smith wanted to do this by appropriating funds from general revenue to state infrastructure instead of taking out more bonds. Our state transportation department already has a heavy debt load and has paid more than $700 million in debt payments in just the last two years, Smith wrote in a Capitol report sent by his office. Has the Missouri Department of Transportation really paid more than $700 million in debt payments in the last two years? Lets take a look at the numbers Documents from MoDOT show that his numbers are on point. MoDOTs 2018 Financial Snapshot shows the department paid a little more than that, totaling $702 million in 2017 and 2018. My preference is to avoid debt when possible, Smith said. But, the debt paid doesnt tell the whole story. The department paid $412 million in debt in 2017. The departments average payment since 2004 is about $242 million a year. The number was higher in 2017 than past years because the agency paid off some of its debt early. In 2017, $117.8 million of bonds were paid off early, saving future interest costs of $29.4 million, said Sally Oxenhandler, MoDOT interim spokeswoman. This helped inflate Smiths point when he said MoDOTs debt reached more than $700 million in just two years. This graph of MoDOTs borrowed funds and annual payments helps visualize the amount of debt MoDOT paid in 2017, compared to debt payments in the past. (Look for the mountain peak.)  Graph courtesy of MoDOTs Financial Snapshot, November 2018 Compared to other state transportation departments, Missouri does not have a lot of debt, said Todd Grosvener, MoDOT assistant financial services director. Still, Smith wants to limit the state department accruing any more debt. Keeping our road funds stable over the coming years is of the utmost importance, Smith said. When MoDOT takes on more debt, it has fewer dollars to improve our roads and bridges. What is the borrowed money used for? The borrowed funds were and are still being used for hundreds of road and bridge projects throughout Missouri, the agency said. The department borrowed the most money in 2010 when it took on an additional $100 million to replace the Mississippi River Bridge in St. Louis. In 2010, the department also borrowed $685 million for the Safe and Sound Bridge Improvement Program. This three-and-a-half-year project replaced or rehabilitated more than 800 bridges across the state. On behalf of the House of Representatives, Ill be keeping a close eye on the amount of debt the state takes on to improve and maintain our transportation infrastructure, Smith said. Smith said, Our state transportation department already has a heavy debt load and has paid more than $700 million in debt payments in just the last two years. His numbers match MoDOTs records. They need clarification, however, because MoDOT paid off a big chunk of debt early, in order to avoid more interest accumulation.",1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,True

Final Rating: Mostly True  ","Says for the equivalent cost of a single mile of freeway, we have a bike infrastructure.","Portlands biking infrastructure is the stuff of legends. For the people who support it, were Biketown U.S.A. -- the city that boasts (at least among medium and large cities) the highest bike commuter rate. For those who are less into that title, our investments in cycling paths and signs are monetary drains on the city budget.Youd think, then, given the strong feelings, that Portland has made significant investments to get a significant infrastructure.But something Mayor Sam Adams said recently caught our attention. In a video on Streetfilms.org, Adams touts our biking culture while adding that we built our bike network for about the same amount of cash that a mile of highway would set us back.You know in 1993 we weren't the bicycling capital of America, he says. Seventeen years later, for the equivalent cost of a single mile of freeway, we have a bike infrastructure.Could that be true? We checked it out.Our first stop was the mayors office, which forwarded us an e-mail from Roger Geller, the citys bike coordinator. Geller said that in 2009, the staff set out to put together an estimated total cost for the citys bike infrastructure in 2008 dollars.When all was said and done, they came up with an estimated value of $52 million and adjusted it up to $60 million to be safe. Heres how they arrived at that figure:We assumed that all elements that contributed to the city's bikeway system were reasonable costs to include, even if they were not built for the express purpose of creating a bikeway. For example, we included the cost of pedestrian half-signals and bicycle-pedestrian bridges across I-5, among others. These signals and bridges facilitate crossings for existing bicycle boulevards, even though they were in place before the bicycle boulevards were constructed.For multi-use trails we split the construction cost of the trail in half and assigned half the cost to pedestrians. For the Eastbank Esplanade I believe we divided the cost into thirds and assigned one-third of the cost to park development, as much of the construction of that pathway was not about transportation but was also about creating a parklike environment.To be clear, he added, the network did not actually cost $60 million. It was probably less than that: The $60 million figure is essentially the replacement value of our network as it existed in 2008 in 2008 dollars. In other words, if the bikeway network disappeared overnight -- and all the elements that contribute to its functionality, whether built by the city's bikeway program or not -- $60 million is approximately what it would cost to replace it all.We called Geller directly to go over the specifics with him, just to make sure we were on the same page. We wanted to be sure that this official estimate included bike-only corridors and other such construction projects.He confirmed it did, adding: I'm very confident in the quality of our estimates.The one thing Geller said it didnt include was city programs that deal with bicycles -- Oregon Safe Routes to School, for example. Even so, the cost of those activities, stretching back to 2004, could be absorbed in the rounding up from $52 million to $60 million, Geller said.Next up, we needed an estimated cost for a mile of freeway. This is where things get a bit tricky.The cost of a mile of freeway isnt easy to pin down. The mayors office said Adams was referring to a mile of a typical 4-lane urban freeway. That cost, according to the citys data, ranges between $20 to $80 million depending on various environmental factors.They chose $60 million -- the middle road -- to indicate the average cost. Of course, Geller wrote in the original e-mail, it is possible to find examples right here in our region of a single interchange that cost much more than $60 million.Their source for that figure was the Rails to Trails Conservancy. That group published the figure in a 2008 report on transportation. We asked the Conservancy for their original source and they sent us a document that offers a considerably wider price range.According to that document the cost of freeways (in 2006 dollars) breaks down as such:-Rural areas: $3.1 million to $9.1 million per lane mile; $12.4 million to $36.4 million for a four-lane mile.-Urban areas: $4.9 miilion to $19.5 million per lane mile; $19.6 million to $78 million for a four lane mile.-Areas with severe restrictions: $16.8 million to $74.7 million per lane mile; $67.2 million to nearly $300 million for a four-lane mile.We tried to get some official estimates from the U.S. Department of Transportation, but they did not respond to our inquiry. Still, the numbers that the Conservancy reported seem to match other estimates, such as this one from the Michigan Department of Transportation.So, where does that put us with our ruling?It seems to us that Gellers estimate of the total value of the bike infrastructure is somewhat inflated. When Adams used this statistic he didnt make clear that he was talking about an urban four-lane freeway. But, certainly, $60 million in bike infrastructure is well above the $12.4 million it would take to make a mile of four-lane rural freeway.That said, Adams is the mayor of an urban area and it makes sense that he would be thinking in terms of the cost of urban freeway construction. When youre talking about that sort of freeway construction, $60 million falls pretty near the middle of the $20 million to $80 million estimated average cost.The mayor could have been a little more exact, but his statistic -- that Portland has spent on its bikeway infrastructure what it would spend on a mile of freeway -- seems to stand up to scrutiny.

Final Rating: Mostly True  ",I have had the challenge during this administration to suspend no less than 37 public officials in about 36 months.,"Some of Florida's public officials have been bad boys and girls, Gov. Charlie Crist says. You know, I have had the challenge during this administration to suspend no less than 37 public officials in about 36 months, Crist told reporters gathered in Tallahassee on Jan. 27, 2010. It's pretty stunning, and it's pretty disappointing. The Florida Constitution enables Crist, as governor, to suspend any elected public official indicted for a crime and remove public officials from office who are convicted. The governor also can suspend state or county officials -- anyone from people appointed to state or local boards or even public notaries -- for misconduct. Is Crist really on a suspension-a-month pace? We asked the governor's office for a list of people suspended by the governor since he took office in January 2007. Officials provided a seven-page document listing 38 names and titles of people they say the governor has suspended or removed from public office. Each entry includes a corresponding charge and points to an executive order codifying the action. (You can read the governor's document for yourself.) The list includes some familiar names: *No. 28 -- James Bob Richburg, the former Northwest Florida State College president. Richburg was suspended from the board of directors of Workforce Florida in April 2009 after being indicted in the case involving former House Speaker Ray Sansom. Sansom has been accused of falsely securing $6 million in taxpayer money to construct a college building that would double as an aircraft hangar for a friend and major Republican donor. * No. 35 -- Scott Rothstein. Rothstein was suspended from a judicial nominating committee after agreeing to be permanently disbarred. A major political fundraiser, Rothsteinpleaded guilty on Jan. 27, 2010, to five counts of racketeering, fraud and money laundering as part of a $1.2 billion Ponzi scheme. * No. 34 and No. 38 -- Miami City Commissioner Michelle Spence-Jones. Spence-Jones was suspended by Crist in November 2009 after being arrested on charges that she redirected $50,000 in county funds to a now-defunct family business. She won her seat back in a special election in January 2010. She was immediately suspended again. The list also includes people probably unfamiliar to most, including eight notary publics. The notary publics, who are considered state officers under Florida law, were suspended in most cases for notarizing signatures and documents improperly. Examining the full list, we found some problems: * Beverly Gallagher,a member of the Broward County School Board, is listed wrongly both as No. 30 and 32. Her entries point to two different executive orders -- one that removes her from office, and one that removes someone else. Gallagher and Broward County Commissioner Josephus Eggelletion (No. 31 on the governor's list) were arrested in September on federal corruption charges, accused of taking bribes. * Gregory Burke is both No. 7 and No. 25. Burke, a commissioner of the South Walton County Mosquito Control District, was first suspended from office Dec. 13, 2007, then removed by Crist on Dec. 24, 2008 -- hence the two separate entries. * Two officials -- Miami City Commissioner Johnny Lee Winton and Hollywood City Commissioner Kenneth Wasserstrom -- were removed from office by Crist but actually suspended by Gov. Jeb Bush. * Another official, Miramar City Commissioner Fitzroy Salesman, appears on the list twice. The first entry was from March 2007, when he was reinstated into office by Crist (he had been suspended by Bush). Salesman was then suspended by Crist in December 2007 after being arrested. * No. 20, Johnny Green, was suspended from the Cross City water board after being charged with one count of conspiracy to commit bribery, according to the governor's office. Green's entry appears to note that the suspension was dissolved by Executive Order 08-235, but that order actually acknowledges a judicial vacancy in the 17th Judicial Circuit. The governor's list also includes one person who has returned to office and appears to overlook another person the governor suspended in 2008. John Scanlon, a commissioner with the Fort Myers Beach Fire Control District, was suspended after drug charges, but reinstated after completion of a pretrial diversion program. And James Roy Paul, superintendent of the Escambia County School District, was suspended from office by the governor in June 2008 after being charged with driving under the influence. But he was not on the governor's list. Where does all of that bring us in the accounting? First, we excluded the double reference to Gallagher and the entry reinstating Salesman. That drops us to 36. We then added Paul, who was not on the governor's list. Back to 37. We then double-checked that everyone on that list had been in fact suspended. We relied on the governor's online repository of executive orders, and when that didn't help, news accounts. When both options failed, as it did in one case, we asked the governor's office for the executive order directly. Then there was the case of three officials (Winton, Wasserstrom, Burke) whom Crist removed from office. You can make an argument that reduces the number of suspensions to 34. Crist told reporters he has had to suspend no less than 37 public officials since taking office in 2007. He's just about right on. The number actually includes people Cristremoved from office, a more severe punishment than suspension. And the final number includes the suspensions of eight public notaries -- not what most people think of when they hear public official.

Final Rating: Mostly True  ","Anywhere in the world, when someone uses a mobile phone, e-mail, the Internet or GPS, they are enjoying the benefits of the American miracle.","U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio used his first speech on the Senate floor, on June 14, 2011, to evoke the American dream. The so-called maiden speech is a big deal for a senator, said fellow Florida Sen. Bill Nelson — and Rubio went for big ideas.America is not perfect, said the freshman Republican, the child of Cuban immigrants. ... But since her earliest days, America has inspired people from all over the world. Inspired them with the hope that one day their own countries would be one like this one. Many others decided they could not wait. And so they came here from everywhere, to pursue their dreams and to work to leave their children better off than themselves. And the result was the American miracle.As he held the floor for nearly 15 minutes, Rubio highlighted rags-to-riches stories that he said happen only in America, describing the founders of Nordstrom, Mattel and eBay. When he finished, Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., commended him, saying, No one expresses American exceptionalism better than Sen. Rubio.Rubio traced Americas role in the 20th century, from two world wars to the Cold War and the defeat of communism. Then he turned to other contributions:While our military and foreign policy contributions helped save the world, it was our economic and cultural innovations that helped transform it. The fruits of the American miracle can be found in the daily lives of people everywhere. Anywhere in the world, when someone uses a mobile phone, e-mail, the Internet or GPS, they are enjoying the benefits of the American miracle. Anywhere in the world, when a bone marrow, lung or heart transplant saves a life, they are touched by the value of the American miracle. And on one night in July of 1969, the whole world witnessed the American miracle firsthand. For on that night an American walked on the surface of the moon, and it was clear to the whole world that these Americans could do anything.We briefly considered wading into fringe conspiracy theories about whether astronauts actually walked on the moon, but got control of ourselves. We were more curious about his other technology claims. Were Americans truly the ones responsible for innovation of the mobile phone, e-mail, the Internet and the global positioning system?We dropped a line to Rubio spokesman Alex Burgos, who provided us with links about inventors of the mobile phone, e-mail, the Internet and GPS. Indeed, stories from The Telegraph (via Huffington Post), NPR, the Internet Society, PBS and MITnews identify American origins for all four technologies. But these are complex systems that have developed over time.

But Rubios spokesman pointed to the inventor of the first portable cellular phone, which is fine by us. (Did you think of dawn-of-the-1900s ship-to-shore communication when Rubio said mobile phone? We didnt think so.)Martin Cooper worked for Illinois company Motorola as it developed the DynaTAC phone and the cellular network behind it in the early 1970s. The lead engineer for the team that developed the phone, Martin made the first wireless call from Manhattan in 1973. The FCC approved the phone -- the worlds first commercial portable cell phone -- for regular folks in 1983.Now, Japan and some European countries were quicker to deploy cellular networks, in the late 70s and very early 80s. But Paul Levinson, a Fordham University professor who wrote the 2004 book Cellphone: The Story of the World's Most Mobile Medium and How It Has Transformed Everything! says its the phone that matters.That was the breakthrough, he said There were several different companies and scientists working on it.  But no one believed that it could be done.  So everything that came afterwards was based on that first breakthrough.An American breakthrough. Score one for Rubio.Internet & E-mailWe read the work from the Internet Society and PBS that Burgos sent our way, then exchanged messages with Stephen Stein, who teaches the history of technology at the University of Memphis.Computer networks that led to the Internet we know today include Arpanet , a 1970s project of the U.S. Department of Defense, and NSFnet, created by the National Science Foundation in the 1980s. These projects, with their indisputably American roots, provided two cornerstones of the modern-day Web: the TCP/IP protocol and a major communications backbone.But Stein pointed out that the way we interact with the Internet owes much to the work of Tim Berners-Lee, a British scientist who worked for CERN, the European Particle Physics Laboratory in Switzerland. It was there -- in the late 80s as NSFnet was being developed in the United States -- that Berners-Lee developed the whole concept of the World Wide Web, Stein said. (Theres more on this in a PBS article related to the one Burgos sent.)HTTP? HTML? Both Berners-Lee.So, yes, Americans developed the Internet, but Berners-Lee made it user-friendly, Stein said.Meanwhile, Virginia Tech scholar Janet Abbate says in her 1999 book Inventing the Internet, published by MIT Press, that even in the expansion of Arpanet , Americans enlisted the help of computer experts from England and France. She also points to Berners-Lees contributions, saying, The history of the Internet is not  a story of a few heroic inventors; it is a tale of collaboration and conflict among a remarkable variety of players.The origins of e-mail, as you might expect, are entwined with the Internet. Electronic mail was part of the development of Arpanet in the early 70s, according to Stein, Abbate and others. American programmer Ray Tomlinson gets credit (and tongue-in-cheek blame) for the first working network mail program, picked up by users of Arpanet sites. Here's what Abbate told us when we asked her about Rubio's claim. I think it's an overstatement to call the Internet a purely American product. Certainly other countries were building their own computer networks (and inter-networks) in parallel with the U.S.; these other networks eventually became part of the Internet, Abbate said. Also, the Internet itself (as opposed to the earlier Apranet) was a collaborative effort with input from computer scientists in France and elsewhere, and I argue in my book that the diversity of input made the resulting system stronger. I do think the U.S. did a remarkably good job with the Internet design and expansion, maybe better than anyone else would or could have done. But if the resulting Internet hadn't suited other countries' needs, they were perfectly capable of creating their own networks (indeed, for a while there were a number of different competing network systems before TCP/IP eventually became the standard). And of course, the World Wide Web was invented at CERN, not in the US or by an American. So does that mean we in the U.S. are enjoying the benefits of the Swiss miracle every time we use the Web? GPSThe satellite technology that puts some of the smart in your smart phone and informs your cars navigation system is a system of satellites funded by taxpayers and operated by the U.S. government. So calling the global positioning system an American miracle is no stretch. The technology was born at Aerospace Corp., a military research contractor in El Segundo, Calif. Its founding president was New York native Ivan Getting. That isnt to say there arent foreign navigation satellites. The United States cooperates with Australia, China, the European Union, India, Japan and Russia on global navigation satellite systems, sometimes referred to as GNSS. But Rubio said GPS, and the history there is fairly clear -cut.The rulingWhat to make of all of this?Rubio's basic point, that the technology behind mobile phones, e-mail, the Internet and GPS all have American roots, holds up. Its true in a general sense, said Sherry Turkle, a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who writes on our relationship with technology. Or, as the University of Memphis professor, Stein, put it: The statement is superficially correct, but there is (as usual) more to the story. Stein was most concerned about the non-American role in the development of the Internet, especially the substantial contribution of England's Berners-Lee.Its also important to note in the context of Rubios only in America rhetoric that while the United States led, it wasnt alone in its innovation. Other nations researchers contributed to the early Internet; commercial mobile phone networks were available overseas before they were in America; other nations operate satellite navigation systems. But in these areas and many others, Americans can claim primacy.",0.7,0.5,1.0,0.6,0.4,0.6,0.8,1.0,0.5,Mostly True

Final Rating: Mostly True",The school voucher bill the Iowa Legislature is considering would give your education tax dollars to corporations.,"Iowa Republicans have forged ahead with efforts to dramatically change education policy in the state, while Democrats and some education leaders and teachers argue a school choice proposal from Gov. Kim Reynolds would divert money from public school systems that need it now more than ever. The push comes after Reynolds highlighted school choice in January during herCondition of the State Address. She argued that parents need flexibility when deciding where their children go to school, especially during a pandemic, but also because available services might vary dramatically from one public school district to another. School choice shouldnt be limited to those who have the financial means or are lucky to live in a district thats confident enough to allow open enrollment, Reynolds said during her Jan. 12 address. Republicans quickly announced their support and theIowa SenatepassedSF 159on Thursday, Jan. 28. The Iowa State Education Association, a prominent Iowa teachers union, launched acampaignagainst the bill and theIowa-Nebraska NAACPargued that it disproportionately would disadvantage low-income families of color while hampering desegregation efforts. Another opponent wasChristina Blackcloud, a Democratic activist from Tama, Iowa, who lost a bid last fall to unseat state Rep. Dean Fisher (R-Montour). Blackcloudtweetedon Jan. 23: Can I be blunt? The school voucher bill that Republicans are trying to ram through the Iowa Legislature would give your education tax dollars to corporations in the hopes they will magically fix education The tweet had been retweeted 190 times and liked by more than 700 people as February started, but would tax dollars usually sent to public schools be sent to corporations? To answer that, we followed the money. The Iowa bill would give financial aid for private school tuition and other education costs to a student who otherwise would attend a public school determined by the federalEvery Student Succeeds Actas needing comprehensive support and improvement. The private school also would have to accept the student for enrollment. The financial aid would come from a Student First Scholarship Program that the bill would establish. That program would be funded by depositing into an account created for a student opting to attend a private school a portion of the per-pupil state funding that youths school district would have received to educate the student. Areportfrom the states Legislative Services Agency estimates that Iowas public school districts would lose $2.1 million that is diverted to private schools in 2023 if the governors plan passes. The state money is raised through a combination of sources, including property taxes. The bill limits spending that money to qualified educational expenses, which include tuition but also fees for tests such as advanced placement exams. Students opting out of their local public school could use state money to attend either private schools or charter schools. But those schools may or may not be considered corporations. Technically,corporationsare a group of individuals legally allowed to act as a single entity, and both public school districts and public charter schools are referred to as corporations inIowa law. But thats not the common understanding of what a corporation represents. In an email exchange with PolitiFact, Blackcloud expressed concern that for-profit education service providers would be allowed to manage charter schools under Reynolds plan. She declined to clarify what she meant when describing private and charter schools as corporations. Charter schoolsare privately run, publicly funded schools. Many are managed by outside organizations, which the Iowa bill calls education service providers, that can be both for-profit and not-for-profit. SF 159 mandates that charter schools form as not-for-profit education organizations but says nothing about whether the education service providers the schools contract with must be for-profit or not-for-profit. TheNational Alliance for Public Charter Schoolsreported in 2019 that 12 percent of U.S. charter schools are managed by for-profit companies and 23 percent are managed by not-for-profit companies. The other 65 percent are independently managed. In general, though, theres no indication of how many charter schools in Iowa would be run by for-profit companies if Reynolds plan passes, especially as the plan would make forming charter schools much easier. That holds true for private schools as well. Blackcloud said, The school voucher bill that Republicans are trying to ram through the Iowa Legislature would give your education tax dollars to corporations in the hopes they will magically fix education. In its current form, SF 159 reallocates money that normally would be spent in public school systems, instead supporting students attending nonpublic schools. That money would be handed over to schools that, under Iowa law, are considered corporations. But, other not-for-profit options will exist, too, for nonpublic schooling.",0.7,0.6,0.9,0.6,0.4,0.5,0.4,0.9,0.5,Mostly True

Final Rating: Half True  ",Fifty percent of the graduating class of the year 2012 will have smoked marijuana or have done illegal drugs.,"Most Georgians missed it, but there was a presidential debate here after all.Actually, it was a forum, and the candidates werent the Republicans vying for the White House. (CNN canceled a debate set for last Thursday in Atlanta when GOP candidates Mitt Romney and Ron Paul said they had other plans.)These candidates were Libertarians, five of them, and they answered questions from a moderator for about an hour at their partys Georgia state convention Feb. 25 in Athens. The Truth-O-Meter started swaying when Gary Johnson, who won a straw poll afterward with 79 percent of the vote, was asked a question about legalizing marijuana.Johnson, who believes in legalizing marijuana, said an individuals drug problem should be handled by his or her family -- not the criminal justice system. He then offered this statistic:Fifty percent of the [high school] graduating class of the year 2012 will have smoked marijuana or have done some illegal drugs, said Johnson, a former two-term governor of New Mexico.We wondered whether Johnson, who initially tried running as a Republican for president this year, was correct?For the record, Johnson doesnt believe teenagers should have access to marijuana. Johnson does believe marijuana is less harmful than alcohol and thinks the money the federal government spends on marijuana enforcement could be better spent against the individuals committing real crimes against society.The Atlanta-based U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention keeps data on marijuana use. According to the CDCs most recent data, from 2009, nearly 46 percent of 12th-graders had smoked marijuana at least once. Nearly 51 percent of 12th-grade boys had used marijuana, while the percentage of girls was lower, at just over 40 percent. In Georgia, the percentage of all 12th-graders who tried marijuana at least once was nearly identical to the national average.The CDC figures showed the following for other illicit drug use by 12th-graders in 2009: There was no overall figure for the percentage of 12th-graders who used any illegal drug.The federal National Institutes of Health has data on its website that says 42 percent of 12th-graders in 2009 had tried marijuana. The percentage had actually declined from nearly 48 percent in 2002. Officials there provided PolitiFact Georgia some data for all types of illicit drug use by 12th-graders.In 2011, 50% of high school seniors reported having tried an illicit drug at some time,40% used one or more drugs in the past 12 months, and 25% used one or more drugs in the prior 30 days, Shirley Simson, a media specialist for the NIHs National Institute on Drug Abuse, told us via email.Simson said theres been an increase in the past four years, primarily due to more teenagers smoking marijuana.The National Center for Education Statistics has data on its website that says about 47 percent of the graduating class of 2009 had tried any type of illicit drug. The percentage has declined each year since 2000, when 54 percent of high school seniors had tried drugs.We couldnt find data about the percentage of high school seniors graduating this year whove smoked marijuana or have done any kind of illicit drug. The studies weve found show drug use among 12th-graders hovers around the 50 percent mark, with a slight decline in recent years.",0.5,0.5,1.0,0.5,0.0,0.0,0.5,0.5,0.5,Half True

Final Rating: Mostly True  ",I cut spending while serving in the state Legislature,"The cornerstone for any Republican seeking to be the next U.S. Representative for New Hampshires Second Congressional District is to come across as an authentic, fiscal conservative. And soon after Salem Republican state Rep. Marilinda Garcia announced that she would enter the Second District race, she touted her cost-cutting chops. I cut spending while serving in the state Legislature and will take that much-needed experience to Washington, Garcia, 30, declared in one of her first post-announcement statements on her Twitter account. The Telegraph and PolitiFact New Hampshire sought to determine the accuracy of that statement. State budget votes Garcia was first elected to the New Hampshire House in 2006 and was a backbencher when Democrats took control of the 400-member body for the first time in nearly a century. Garcia lost her reelection bid in 2008, but quickly won her seat back in a 2009 special election. Initially, Garcia served on the House Children and Family Law Committee, the panel that oversees divorce, adoption and custody but has essentially no direct impact on state spending matters. Claiming to cut spending is a pretty broad statement, but well start with the major vote New Hampshire legislators take to increase or cut spending -- consideration of the states biennial budget. When Garcia was sworn in on Jan. 3, 2007, the state budget set by her fellow Republicans was $9.3 billion. The subsequent $9.7 billion budget, called for a 4 percent increase for fiscal years 2008 and 2009 was written primarily by Democrats. Garcia voted against it. The next $11.5 billion budget, also written by Democrats, called for a hefty 19 percent increase in spending for fiscal years 2010 and 2011. Garcia also voted against that. And the next state budget, crafted by conservative Republicans, including Garcia,after the GOP took over the chamber, cut back spending by more than a billion dollars to $10.3 billion. That budget plan was the first reduction in absolute dollars since World War II. Garcia voted in favor of that budget. Finally, the most recent $11 billion budget, covering fiscal years 2013 and 2014 and written by a Democratic majority, restored some of the cuts made in the previous budget. Garcia again voted no, though she said he didnt mind restoringcuts to higher education, public safety and programs for troubled children. I thought with existing recovery of revenues we could add back some of those items, Garcia said in response to our inquiry about her record of cutting spending. Instead, she said she voted against it because of the removal of the Certificate of Need program that approves all construction projects for hospitals. I wanted to see those health care reforms in place, but they got taken out, so that's why I voted against it, Garcia said. Still, her budget votes while in the House are fairly consistent: Shes voted against every budget that called for an increase in spending and supported the one that cut spending. Other spending Reviewing Garcias entire, seven-year voting record and the bills she sponsored, Garcia consistently supportedpolicies that would cut spending and taxes. In 2011, she voted to cut the taxes on hotel room rentals and meals and tobacco. She endorsed making it easier for local governments to adopt spending caps and supported banning higher-education spending on New Hampshire Public Television. Last year she opposed raising state taxes on gasoline and tobacco. In addition, in 2011, Garcia voted for a bill to require agencies propose every two years how they would live with 10 percent cut in state spending. And in 2012, Garcia voted in favor of business tax breaks totaling more than $10 million a year. She did vote in favor of one bill that could have increased spending at the local level. She voted for House Bill 1305 in 2012 that would have reinstated an exemption from property taxes for telephone and communication company poles and conduits. Critics said this could have led to raising local property taxes $5 million to $6 million statewide to make up the difference. The GOP-led House killed the bill 166-133, with Garcia on the losing end. Does she deserve credit for cutting spending? When politicians claim credit for something that happens on their watch, we consider whether that credit is justified before we give the statement a Truth-O-Meter rating. In Garcias case, she is a legislator, not an executive, so she cant unilaterally cut spending. And much of the time, she has been in the minority. However, during the one session in which she served in the majority, she can make a plausible claim for deserving credit for lower spending. In April 2011, then-House Speaker William O'Brien, a Republican, appointed Garcia to the House Finance Committee. She served on the committee when the state faced an $800 million budgetary hole caused by overly optimistic revenue projections. We solved it not by raising taxes but by cutting in a responsible way, Garcia said. At least one fellow Republican agrees. Former House Chief of Staff Gregory Moore said that when it comes to budgets, there are three kinds of legislators: Those who believe in smaller government, those who believe in more government and those who are pragmatic on the question from issue to issue. From the outset, Marilinda Garcia came from the first camp. Our ruling Garcia said, I cut spending while serving in the state Legislature. Her voting record on the state budget -- which comprises any legislators biggest impact on state spending -- show that Garcia voted against every budget that increased spending and voted in favor of the OBrien budget that cut state spending for the first time since World War II. We found two minor asterisks. Even though she voted against the most recent state budget, she didnt oppose it because it increased spending -- she opposed it because of how it treated a program that governs hospital construction and expansion. And she supported a bill on telephone and communication company poles and conduits that would have had the effect of raising taxes.Still, there are few, if any, votes shes taken that would have increased spending or increased the size of government.",0.8,0.3,0.9,0.5,0.2,0.4,0.3,0.9,0.6,Mostly True

Final Rating: Mostly True",A gay man who survived #orlando hate crime can STILL show up to work in FL tomorrow and have his boss fire him simply because he is gay.,"As the motive behind the deadly June 12 shooting at a gay nightclub in Orlando was still being debated, singer Clay Aiken took to Twitter to characterize it as a hate crime and report that gays can be summarily fired in Florida simply because of their sexual orientation. A gay man who survived #orlando hate crime can STILL show up to work in FL tomorrow and have his boss fire him simply because he is gay, Aiken tweeted. For this fact check, we will look at whether Florida really offers no job protection to gays and lesbians. The short answer: Aiken is mostly correct when it comes to Florida as a whole, but he's wrong to suggest that there is no protection anywhere in the state. Federal law does not protect the employment rights of the LGBT community, nor does the state of Florida. However, thanks to city and county law, members of the LGBT community do have employment protection in some areas of Florida. Currently, 10 counties and 19 cities, including Tampa, St. Petersburg, Miami, Miami Beach, St. Augustine, Sarasota and Orlando, have passed protections for gay workers, according to Frank Penela, communications director for the Florida Commission on Human Relations. Penela also reported that although state law doesn't specifically reference LGBT status in employment, the Commission will accept some cases under sex-based discrimination. Allegations of gender identity/transgender discrimination, for example, can be viewed as sex discrimination. Aiken spokesman Josh Pultz noted that bills designed to add protection for gender identity and sexual orientation died in Florida's House and Senate in 2016. Regardless of existing employment anti discrimination ordinances protecting LGBT in at least 31 municipalities, covering as many as 15 counties in the state, the state does not provide such protections — leaving LGBT workers in as many as 52 of the 67 counties without any protection from being terminated because of their orientation, Pultz said in an email. Clay's comment stated nothing more than that a gay man in Florida can still be fired for being gay. It did not specify any certain municipality and therefore is factually accurate, he wrote. According to the American Civil Liberties Union's website, 22 states and the District of Columbia prohibit employment discrimination based on sexual orientation. The District and 19 states also ban discrimination based on gender identity. That makes Floridaone of 28 states with no statewide protection against discrimination. Our ruling Aiken tweeted, A gay man who survived #orlando hate crime can STILL show up to work in FL tomorrow and have his boss fire him simply because he is gay. That is generally true across the state, because gays and lesbians lack protection from employment discrimination under state law and under federal law.However, 19 Floridacities often offer protection to gay workers, including the city of Orlando. Another 10 counties also offer protections. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/7e41f675-9288-4071-bbb7-5510906aa369",0.8,0.4,1.0,0.6,0.3,0.1,0.5,1.0,0.7,Mostly True

Final Rating: Half True",The U.S. gun homicide rate is 20 times the combined rate of other western nations.,"U.S. Rep. Jim Moran marked the first anniversary of the shooting of Rep. Gabrielle Giffords in Arizona with a call for more gun control.The U.S. gun homicide rate is 20 times the combined rate of other western nations, Moran, D-8th, wrote in a Jan. 10 columnthat ran in the Falls Church News-Press.That statistic caught our eye. We wondered if Moran is right.A Moran spokeswoman told us the congressmans claim is based on a study of the homicide rates of wealthy nations in 2003, conducted by the UCLA School of Public Health. The report, published in 2010, uses data from the World Health Organization to compare gun-related homicide, gun-related suicide and unintentional and undetermined gun deaths for all ages and both sexes.Vital statistics from the U.S. were compared to those from 22 other high-income countries with populations over 1 million people that reported causes of mortality to WHO for 2003. Researchers relied on The World Banks definition of a high income nation, which included countries that had a gross national income per capita of $12,276 or more for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2011.In addition to the U.S., the study included Australia, Austria, Canada, Czech Republic, Finland, France, Germany, Hungary, Iceland, Italy, Japan, Luxembourg, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Portugal, Slovakia, Spain, Sweden, United Kingdom (England and Wales), United Kingdom (Northern Ireland) and United Kingdom (Scotland).Researchers determined that the rate of homicides with guns in the U.S. was 4.1 per 100,000 people; the same rate combining the 22 other countries was 0.2 per 100,000 in 2003. The rate of homicides using guns in the U.S. was 19.5 times the rate of the other countries. Moran, rounding up, correctly repeated that factoid.We decided to see if there were more recent numbers than 2003. U.N. and nationalstatisticsfor those same countries showed the gap closed. The most recent data, mostly from 2009, shows a gun homicide rate of 3.0 per 100,000 people in the U.S. and 0.2 in the 22 other countries used in the firearm fatality study. The U.S., with its decrease, had a rate around 15 times those of other countries.Next, we moved away from numbers for a second and examined the terminology Moran used in his column. It is imprecise.The congressman wrote that the U.S. gun homicide rate is 20 times higher than other western nations. But in fact, he was comparing them to them a selective group of wealthy nations. And not all them -- such as Japan -- are typically considered a western nation.The term western nation is not listed in Websters New World College Dictionary and we found a range of definitions online.Most commonly, the term is used to describe countries where Western Europeans have settled or have influence. We tried to come up with a list of such nations and settled on the 28 countries that are NATO members.The most recent gun-related homicide rate for the U.S. was 3.0 per 100,000 compared to an 0.3 for the rest of the NATO nations. The U.S. rate was 10 times higher.Our ruling:Moran, calling for stronger gun regulations, wrote The U.S. gun homicide rate is 20 times the combined rate of other western nations.Moran used the right number from a report based on 2003 data. But the researchers did not claim to analyze western nations, they compared gun homicide rates in 23 populous, high income countries, including Japan.If you compare the most recent data on the same group of nations, mostly based on 2009 statistics, the U.S. gun homicide rate is 15 times higher than the other countries. The number fell to 10 times as high when we defined the inexact term of western nations as countries belonging to NATO.So Morans figures are outdated and on the high side. His terminology is loose. But his point -- that gun homicide rates in the U.S. tower over those of other wealthy European nations -- holds up.",0.5,0.5,1.0,0.5,0.0,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,Half True

Final Rating: Mostly True  ","Since the Sandy Hook tragedy, more than seven children PER DAY have died from gun violence.","U.S. Rep. Jackie Speier, D-San Mateo, is one of Californias most prominent advocates for gun control -- and one of the few members of Congress to personally experience and survive gun violence. Speierwas shot five times at point blank range in 1978 on a trip accompanying Rep. Leo Ryan to Jonestown, the remote commune in Guyana where 909 people died from cyanide poisoning and other means. Speier was a legal adviser to Ryan, who along with four others were shot and killed in an ambush near the compound. Speier was rescued a day later. Since then, shes spent much of her career in politics leading the call for gun safety. It was no surprise Speierspoke out against gun violence on Dec. 14, 2016, the fourth anniversary of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting. The shooter killed 20 students, ages six and seven, along with six adult staff members in whats considered the deadliest mass shooting at a school in U.S. history. On the anniversary, Speierposted an image on Twitter of herself holding a card reading #EndGunViolence. Above the image she claimed: Since the Sandy Hook tragedy, more than seven children PER DAY have died from gun violence. We wanted to know whether the startling and somber statistic was true. We set out on a fact check. Our research A spokeswoman for Speier cited the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence as the source of the statistic. She said the campaign used information from an online database of fatal injury reports maintained by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. We did not hear back from a spokesman for the Brady Campaign. But we found a similar statistic on the organizations website: Every day, 7 children and teens die from gun violence. The website notes that it crunched CDC data for children and young people through age 19. The federal agency is considered a leading authority on mortality and injury statistics. It includes data through 2015. To examine Speiers claim, we searched the database for the number of young people who died in connection with guns from the start of 2013 through 2015. Those are the most recent available years following the Sandy Hook shooting. We found 7,838 deaths in connection with firearms for people ages 0 through 19. That works out to 7.15 deaths a day during this three-year period -- which matches Speiers claim of more than seven per day. These include all types of gun deaths from accidents to homicides to suicides. About 36 percent resulted from suicides. Some might take issue with Speier lumping in 18 year-olds and 19 year-olds as children. Gun deaths for these two ages accounted for nearly half of the 7,838 young people killed in the two-year period. Heres a look at the breakdown of deaths by age group: 0-4 years: 247 5-9 years: 218 10-14 years: 847 15-19 years: 6,526 The National Institute of Justice, a research arm of the U.S. Department of Justice, has stated that young people aged 15 to 24 are the group most at risk for gun violence. If considering only elementary school aged children, the total who die in connection with guns would be roughly one every four days -- still a tragic number, but not close to seven per day. We interpreted Speiers use of the word children, however, to include a broader group of young people, including teenagers. Our ruling California Congresswoman Jackie Speier recently claimed: Since the Sandy Hook tragedy, more than seven children PER DAY have died from gun violence. Speiers claim is backed up by the CDCs fatal injury report data, which shows an average of 7.15 young people per day, aged 0 to 19, died in connection with firearms between 2013 and 2015. Its important to note these include all types of gun deaths: accidents, homicides and suicides. All gun deaths are violent, but Speiers statement could be interpreted as only including homicides or accidents. Finally, Speiers claim might also lead some to think shes talking about young school aged children, given that she invokes an elementary school shooting. The data show teenagers and young adults make up the vast majority of deaths due to guns in America, while elementary aged children account for a small fraction. The Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, the source Speier relied on, offers a more complete look at this statistic on its website. It notes that children and teens are included in the seven deaths per day. Speiers statement is on the right track. But it could have used some clarifications. MOSTLY TRUE– The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/423277eb-4cab-4fc1-8ab5-357f808c343d",1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,1.0,0.5,Mostly True

Final Rating: Mostly True",Says Betsy DeVos is the most unpopular person in our government.,"A congressional hearing about the Trump administrations policy on student debt turned personal for Education Secretary Betsy DeVos. Most of the Dec. 12 hearing focused on DeVos actions related to a student debt relief rule. Democrats said DeVos made it harder for certain students to get debt relief, while Republicans defended her response to Obama-era rules. At the hearing, the main topic was how DeVos sought to make changes to the borrower defense to repayment rule. The provision was little used until the Obama administration established new rules to help students get their federal education loans cancelled if colleges misrepresented graduation rates, their ability to transfer credits or their job placement rates. The Obama administration finalized changes to the regulations in 2016 after Corinthian Colleges, a for-profit chain, closed its doors amid fraud allegations. DeVos sought to rewrite the rules, leading to extensive litigation, including a contempt of court finding against DeVos. DeVos blamed the Obama administration for the backlog of tens of thousands of cases and announced changes that include tiers of loan relief. U.S. Rep. Frederica Wilson, a former school board member and principal from South Florida, went after DeVos, saying she is trying to destroy public education. You are the most unpopular person in our government, said Wilson, a Democrat. Millions will register to vote in 2020. Many will vote to remove you more than to remove the president. The ranking Republican on the committee, Rep. Virginia Foxx of North Carolina, said Wilsons comments were over the line. DeVoss confirmation in 2017 was a contentious one for the Trump administration and required a tie-breaking vote by Vice President Mike Pence. DeVos, a longtime wealthy Republican donor from Michigan, is an advocate for vouchers and charter schools. As fact-checkers, we wanted to focus on the checkable aspect of what Wilson said: Is DeVos really the most unpopular person in the U.S. government? Wilsons statement about in our government was overly broad, but what she was referring to was what poll respondents said about DeVos compared to other Trump Cabinet officials. We found polling that supports Wilsons statement about DeVoss popularity, but the polling is more than one year old. We found that YouGov and Morning Consult have conducted separate polls that compare the favorability of Trumps Cabinet members. Wilsons spokeswoman cited a 2017 article in the Huffington Post entitled, How Betsy DeVos Became The Most Hated Cabinet Secretary. The article cited an October 2017 HuffPost/YouGov internet poll that found 35% had a strongly unfavorable view of DeVos, the highest among 13 officials. (Former Attorney General Jeff Sessions finished second.) However, the poll also showed that many respondents were not familiar enough with the Cabinet members to give a favorability opinion. DeVos was among the most familiar officials, as 30% of respondents said they were unfamiliar with her. YouGov has polled about DeVos favorability five times since she was appointed. The most recent poll, in April 2018, found DeVos had the highest very unfavorable rating (28%). Politico/Morning Consult polled about the favorability of DeVos on four occasions since 2017, with the most recent one in the spring of 2018. That poll showed DeVos with a 31% very unfavorable rating, the highest among 15 Cabinet members. Even though the polls are a little dated, Wilsons statement is consistent with the evidence, said Washington University political scientist Steven S. Smith. Education Department spokeswoman Angela Morabito told PolitiFact that DeVos isnt working to win a popularity contest. But she pointed to polling by an education research and policy journal showing growing public support for certain school choice programs. Related: By the numbers: Is college worth the cost? Wilson said DeVos is the most unpopular person in our government. Two polling organizations asking about popularity for about a dozen Trump administration officials back up her statement, though they are a little outdated. We found no polling about the popularity for DeVos in 2019.",0.7,0.3,0.9,0.5,0.2,0.4,0.6,0.5,0.4,Mostly True

Final Rating: Mostly True  ","Of 30,000 individuals arrested a year for crimes that are 16 or 17, over 95 percent of them do not result in a criminal conviction. Only 1.5 percent of them ultimately go to state prison.","New York remains one of two states that can prosecute 16- and 17-year-old defendants as adults in criminal courts. Some Albany lawmakers want all of them treated as children in Family Court instead. They're pressing to include a measure to accomplish that as part of state budget negotiations.They want separate facilities for those sentenced to serve time, saying that separating them from criminals 18 and over in prison would lower the recidivism rate for the younger offenders.Lowering the age of criminal responsibility would lead to shorter sentences for the younger offenders. Opponents of the measure, however, warn about a blanket policy that treats every 16- and 17-year-old offenderas a child. They want judges to be able to decide who to treat as adults in cases involving serious crimeslike murder or sexual assault. The two sides are still negotiating. State Sen. Pat Gallivan, a Republican from Elma, says such a broad proposal may not be necessary because New York state usually treats 16- and 17-year-old defendants differently than adults. When you have roughly 30,000 individuals arrested a year for crimes that are 16 or 17, over 95 percent of them do not result in a criminal conviction,Gallivan said at a news conference. Only 1.5 percent of them ultimately go to state prison. So, I would make an argument that we are already treating them differently. Is Gallivan right on the numbers? A commission's report The senators data comes from a 2014 report by Gov. Andrew M. Cuomos Commission on Youth, Public Safety, and Justice. The commission convened to make recommendations on raising the age of criminal responsibility. The report shows about 33,000 cases resolved in 2013, with almost 2.7 percent receiving a sentence to state prison. That data has since been updated by the state Division of Criminal Justice Services, which reported close to 35,000resolved cases involving 16- and 17-year-old defendants in 2013. Only 1,689 cases, or 4.8 percent, resulted in a criminal conviction, according to the data. Some 5,215 other cases resulted in a youth offender adjudication, given when someone is found guilty but a judge seals the record at sentencing. In all, 838 cases resulted in a state prison sentence, 2.4 percent of the cases resolved that year. Some 1,808 cases, about 5 percent, resulted in a jail sentence for lesser convictions. Defendants in the remaining cases were either found not guilty or received different sentences like probation or a fine. Or else they received a conditional discharge, allowing them to avoid incarceration or other punishment as long as they complied with conditions set by the court. More recent data There were 24,572 cases resolved involving 16- and 17-year-old defendants in 2016. Only 1,012 cases, or 4.1 percent, resulted in a criminal conviction. Some 3,802 resulted in a youthful offender adjudication. The state said 581 cases, or 2.4 percent of all cases, resulted in a state prison sentence, while 1,072 cases resulted in a local jail sentence. Our ruling Gallivan, a former Erie County sheriff and captain in the State Police, said of 30,000 individuals arrested a year for crimes that are 16 or 17, over 95 percent of them do not result in a criminal conviction. Only 1.5 percent of them ultimately go to state prison. State data shows close to 96 percent of cases involving 16- and 17-year-old defendants did not result in a criminal conviction last year. Only 2.4 percent of these cases received sentences to state prison. That drops to less than 1.5percent if you exclude youth offenderadjudications.The state says both categories of offenders should be included in sentencing data. Gallivan is slightly off on the numbers, but his claim that few of these cases result in a conviction - and even fewer receive a state prison sentence - is correct. His statement is accurate but needs additional information.",0.8,0.2,1.0,0.7,0.0,0.1,0.3,0.9,0.7,Mostly True

Final Rating: Half True  ","Gov. Rick Perry broke his promise that he would not accept a $40,000 pay increase.","Bill White, the Democratic gubernatorial nominee, lashed out at his GOP rival, Gov. Rick Perry, over his state-paid salary during a June 17 news conference, suggesting Perry had gone back on his word not to accept a five-figure raise. Several years ago, he signed a law giving himself a $40,000 pay increase, White said. He told you, the people in the press, that he wasnt going to take that pay increase. I dont think he kept that promise. We decided to review Whites left-right-left combination. In response to our inquiry, Whites campaign pointed us to Perrys tax returns, newspaper articles and actions taken by the Texas Legislature in 2007. That year, lawmakers included raises for eight top officials, including the governor, in the budget bill for fiscal years 2008 and 2009, according to a Dallas Morning News article published June 7, 2007. Perry signed the legislation into law June 15, 2007, according to information from the Legislatures Web site. In the law, the governors annual salary was set to jump 30 percent, from $115,345 to $150,000 -- an increase of $34,655, which is less than the $40,000 that White quoted. Katy Bacon, a spokeswoman for White, told us when we inquired that White overstated the size of the raise at his recent press conference and should have said about $35,000. Whites campaign pointed us to news articles indicating Perry wouldnt take the raise. Robert Black, then a spokesman for the governor, was quoted in the June 2007 Morning News article saying Perry would not accept the pay raise when it kicked in that September, the start of the states fiscal year: He hasnt taken a pay raise and doesnt think its necessary. A Fort Worth Star Telegram news article published June 8, 2007, quoted Black as saying that we asked them [lawmakers] to give the governor an opt-out provision, and they did that. A clause in the 2008-09 budget titled Governors Salary Authorization says the governor can set his salary at any amount below the listed authorization — in this case, $150,000. Perrys office confirmed that he has not exercised the opt-out provision since his raise became law. We didnt find statements from Perry or his aides to the effect that instead of refusing the pay increase, the governor would donate it to charity. Yet Perry spokeswoman Katherine Cesinger wrote us in an e-mail: The governor did not seek a pay raise, but the Texas Legislature authorized an increase from $115,000 to $150,000 in 2007 and 2009. Since that time, he has only taken home about $115,000 each fiscal year and has donated the rest to charity. Perrys take-home state pay -- meaning wages subject to federal income taxes -- increased from $103,320 in 2006 to $111,361 in 2007 and $135,925 in 2008, according to his tax returns for those years, which he has made public. Bob Martin, a Houston accountant who studied Perrys tax returns at the request of an Associated Press reporter, told us the amount of taxes that were withheld from Perrys pay in 2008 indicated that his gross salary was $150,000. He speculated that the difference between Perrys taxable wages and his gross salary could be explained by pre-tax deductions such as retirement contributions; such deductions would be on Perrys W-2 form. We found no sign of Perry making his W-2s public. In an Aug. 27, 2009 article, the Morning News reported that in 2008, Perry took the almost $30,000 raise provided to him by the Legislature and spread it among the Texas Association Against Sexual Assault, the March of Dimes and a foundation that provides aid to families of fallen veterans. Perrys 2008 tax return shows gifts of $9,996 each to the March of Dimes, the Special Operations Warrior Foundation, and the Texas Association Against Sexual Assault, where Perrys wife, Anita, works. The governor filed an extension on his 2009 tax return, so details on more recent charitable donations and take-home pay are not yet available.  The White campaign says its examination of Perrys available tax returns for the years hes been governor found that Perry has not yet given the full amount of his pay increase to charity. The campaign did two different calculations: First, it compared the increase in Perrys taxable state-paid income in 2007 and 2008 (about $40,000) with his total charitable gifts during the same time ($38,399). Second, it compared the increase in Perrys gross state salary ($46,206) with the donations ($38,399). Cesinger later said the governor had contributed an additional $8,668 in 2008 to the State Employee Charitable Campaign that was not claimed as a deduction on his tax return. A gift of that amount would close the gap cited by the White campaign. All in all, does White land his three-part punch? He errs on the size of the raise. While Perry didnt personally tell the media he wouldnt take the raise, a gubernatorial spokesman speaking on his behalf was quoted in newspaper articles as saying so. Perrys spokeswoman told us hes made charitable donations exceeding the additional dollars that came his way in the raise. But thats not the same as not accepting the raise in the first place. Nor has Perry used the opt-out provision put into the law to allow him to do so.",0.5,0.5,1.0,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,1.0,0.5,Half True

Final Rating: Mostly True  ",Women of childbearing age spend 68 percent more in out-of-pocket health care costs than men.,"The Supreme Court recently decided Burwell vs. Hobby Lobby -- a landmark decision in which a 5-4 majority ruled that a closely held, private corporation could decline, on religious grounds, to pay for certain kinds of contraceptives otherwise mandated in employee health coverage by the Affordable Care Act. The decision was a victory for supporters of religious freedom and a defeat for backers of expanded reproductive health care. The unveiling of the decision on June 30, 2014, produced widespread commentary and debate over its merits. Associate Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburgs stinging dissent attracted wide attention from those who opposed the majority opinion. We noticed the following claim in Ginsburgs dissent: Women of childbearing age spend 68 percent more in out-of-pocket health care costs than men. We thought it would be interesting to see how that statistic was calculated. But when we looked into it, we were in for a surprise: The 68 percent figure was a lot older than wed expected. Where the statistic came from In her dissent, Ginsburg cited the statistic as being from a statement of Sen. Feinstein, which appears to refer to a Senate floor speech by Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif. During the debate on President Barack Obamas Affordable Care Act in December 2009, Feinstein said, The fact is, women have different health needs than men, and these needs often generate additional costs. Women of childbearing age spend 68 percent more in out-of-pocket health care costs than men. Most people don't know that, but it is actually true. The 68 percent statistic has been cited repeatedly in the judicial debate over the contraceptive mandate in the health care law. In the Hobby Lobby case alone, it was cited in briefs by the Obama administration, as well as in an amicus, or friend-of-the-court, brief by 91 Democratic members of Congress and a separate amicus brief by the National Womens Law Center. We found a flurry of references to the statistic in court cases, bills, and reports in 2014, 2013, 2012, 2009, 2003, 2002, 1999 and 1998. After a lot of digging, PolitiFact was able to trace the 68 percent figure back to a publication released by the Womens Research & Education Institute titled, Women's Health Care Costs and Experiences. That study was published in 1994 -- and if 1994 was the publication year, its reasonable to assume that the data in question are even older than that. (We couldnt find the full report online, and inquiries to the group and to the original author were not answered.) Is there newer data? Could Ginsburg -- or anyone else who cited the 68 percent statistic in recent years -- have used more up-to-date data? Yes. PolitiFact asked officials at the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality -- a part of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services -- to walk us through the data in the Medical Expenditures Panel Survey, which is the source several independent experts had suggested we use to test Ginsburgs statistic. It turns out that for 2011, women between 18 and 44 had out-of-pocket expenses that averaged 69 percent higher than men of the same age range. Thats virtually indistinguishable from what Ginsburg said. Still, its worth noting that alternative data comes up with somewhat lower estimates. Data from a different HHS source -- National Health Expenditure Accounts -- found that in 2010, women between 19 and 44 had 52 percent greater out-of-pocket spending than men of the same age range. And an annual study by the Health Care Cost Institute, which is based on information supplied by private health insurance companies, found an even smaller gender gap. In 2012, women's out-of-pocket expenses were 36 percent higher than men's. However, this figure is for all women through age 65, rather than just childbearing age, so its not an apples-to-apples comparison. The experts we checked with didnt doubt that women of childbearing age tend to pay more out of their pocket for health care. Women under 65 use a lot more health services than do men, especially preventive care, screenings and well-care, all of which is covered less by insurance than hospital expenditures, said Gail Wilensky, who headed Medicare and Medicaid under President George H.W. Bush. Still, there are indications that the gap is narrowing between men and women, perhaps because the insurance market has changed substantially over the past 20-plus years, with cost-sharing becoming much more significant than it was in 1994. The annual Kaiser Family Foundation/Health Research & Educational Trust study found a rising percentage of workers with employer-provided health coverage facing an annual deductible of $1,000 or more. The share of people in that category rose from 10 percent in 2006 to 38 percent in 2013 -- a far shorter time horizon than 20 years. Meanwhile, data from HHS national accounts series shows that out-of-pocket spending for men grew faster than it did for women between 2002 and 2010 -- a 3.9 percent growth rate for men, compared with 3.3 percent for women, Tanner said. The significance of an old statistic We cant be 100 percent sure that by citing Feinstein, Ginsburg was simply relying on a very old statistic without further checking. However, given the long history of the identical number being used, we suspect the statistic was repeated, in most or all cases, without being checked against more recent data. Ginsburg did not respond to an inquiry for this story sent through the Supreme Courts public information office; justices rarely if ever comment to the media. In any case, we found repeated mentions of this statistic by advocates, lawmakers and government officials without citing the original 1994 source, leaving the incorrect impression that the number was current. Our ruling Ginsburg wrote that women of childbearing age spend 68 percent more in out-of-pocket health care costs than men. Some estimates cited by a litany of politicians and advocates are based on 20-year-old data. But more recent data shows that women do still pay more out of pocket for health care than men do, with one estimate very close -- 69 percent -- and other estimates in the 40 percent to 50 percent range.",1.0,0.2,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.1,0.5,0.2,0.5,Mostly True

Final Rating: Mostly True  ",Says a portfolio managed by the Texas General Land Office earned 22 percent last year while the states emergency reserve account experienced a 1 percent gain.,"Criticizing a poke at his not releasing millions of dollars to support public schools, Texas Land Commissioner Jerry Patterson said that doing so might cut into double-digit returns on investments managed by the General Land Office.In a letter he made public Aug. 22, 2012, Patterson, a Republican, said that those who want him to transfer $300 million in investment earnings to the State Board of Education for school needs do not understand the value of keeping such money invested so the states education endowment, the Permanent School Fund, continues to gain value.A pro-Democratic group, Progress Texas, accuses Patterson of inappropriately hoarding the millions. Patterson counters that the School Land Board, which he chairs, has discretion over whether to transfer the money and, he told us by telephone, it has until September 2013 to decide. His spokesman, Jim Suydam, also told us by email that the board approved a resolution in early 2011 to release $250 million of earnings in both 2012 and 2013 to the State Board of Education.In his letter, Patterson said that draining off additional earnings as Progress Texas says he must is a bad choice... because last year the GLO-managed PSF earned 22 percent and, due to statutory liquidity requirements, the rainy day fund earned just 1 percent. He was comparing the portion of the Permanent School Fund managed by the land office to earnings on the states savings account, otherwise known as the Economic Stabilization Fund. If your family needed a quick infusion of cash, Patterson wrote, would you withdraw cash from the investment account earning 22 percent or the account earning 1 percent?Were not venturing that question, but wondered if Patterson made an accurate earnings comparison.Starting in 2005, the land office was given the authority to invest in real estate using proceeds received from selling lands or drawing on revenue from Permanent School Fund mineral leases and royalties, the agency notes on a web page. Professional fund management firms oversee the investments, the agency says, while the land board, consisting of the commissioner and two citizen appointees, manages the sale of Permanent School Fund land and mineral leases.To our inquiry, Suydam provided an agency report to the Legislature stating that through March 2012, the market value of the agencys investments made from the Permanent School Fund was $3.077 billion, about half of that reflecting externally managed direct real estate investments and nearly $1.2 billion attributable to short-term investments in the states treasury, which Suydam later said means money set aside so its on call for the agencys real estate investments.The report, dated Sept. 1, 2012, says that gross time-weighted returns on the portfolio in the 12 months through March amounted to nearly 22.9 percent, though that is without considering the short-term investments. Counting the cash-on-call portion, the report says, the time-weighted returns on the portfolio were 13.03 percent.Time-weighted returns?By email, Suydam told us the term describes a complex calculation that uses values for every day in the period being measured which, he said, explains why the 23 percent return shown for the real estate investments does not align with the 30 percent return that we calculated by comparing the market value of those investments at the end of March 2012 to the comparable figure at the end of March 2011.Asked how the earnings on real estate through March 2012 compare to recent 12-month periods, Suydam said such investments generated nearly 14 percent in market value in the 12 months through March 2011, but lost about 15 percent in the 12 months through March 2010.We checked on the rainy day funds earnings with Lauren Willis, spokeswoman for State Comptroller Susan Combs, who oversees state finances.Willis said by email that money in the reserve fund, created in 1988, is invested like other funds in the states treasury in stable, high-quality investments. In 2011, Willis said, the average yield on all those funds was 0.74 percent -- generating nearly $194 million in interest income including $51.9 million added to the rainy day fund. R.J. DeSilva, another Combs spokesman, said by email the rate of return might or might not have been about the same through the 12 months running through March 2012.In a telephone interview, we asked Patterson about why his letter mentions the higher returns on the real estate investments alone rather than also taking into account the lower returns influenced by the agencys cash-on-call funds.I dont count the cash, Patterson replied, because its not part of our investment portfolio.The land office, Patterson noted, is limited by law to managing just part of the overall education endowment. Suydam later said by email that as of the end of March, the market value of the agencys portion of the PSF, not including the value of minerals or state-owned land, was nearly $3.1 billion. He said the State Board of Education oversaw the funds remaining $25.6 billion.Our rulingPattersons reference to 22 percent in earnings over the 12 months running through March 2012 does not account for reduced earnings from nearly $1.2 billion in cash-on-call money supporting the agencys real estate investments. That clarification would be helpful, though it still seems reasonable, overall, to focus on the portion of the portfolio that would be expected to reap sizable gains. Separately, the claim seems to reflect the annual earnings on the rainy day fund, though the commissioners March-to-March time period does not match the calendar-year approach used by the state comptroller.",0.8,0.2,1.0,0.9,0.0,0.1,0.3,0.6,0.7,Mostly True

Final Rating: Mostly True  ","Says Paul Ryan voted for two wars that were unpaid for, voted for the Bush tax cuts that were unpaid for, voted for the prescription drug bill that cost as much as my health care bill -- but wasn't paid for.","In closed-door remarks to campaign supporters on April 14, 2011, President Barack Obama looked back in frustration at lengthy negotiations with Republicans over funding to keep the federal government operating.Obama opined, as a CBS News online story reported, that he expects Republicans to continue using the budget process to enact their political agenda under the guise of cutting spending.The president singled out U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis., the House Budget Committee chairman who has authored a long-term deficit-reduction plan.When Paul Ryan says his priority is to make sure, you know, he's just being America's accountant, trying to be responsible ...This is the same guy who voted for two wars that were unpaid for, voted for the Bush tax cuts that were unpaid for, voted for the prescription drug bill that cost as much as my health care bill -- but wasn't paid for, Obama told his supporters. So it's not on the level.In making the remark, Obama pointed to several big-ticket items approved during the Bush administration while Ryan was in Congress -- ones he says have helped drive the nations record deficits.Given the prominence of the protagonists and the timeliness of the comments, we decided to take a look at Obamas critique of Ryan.With the words, Obama is offering an opinion about how Ryan has framed his budget-cutting efforts. We cant fact-check the presidents opinion about Ryans message. But we can focus on the factual assertions, and try to put them into some context.We started with the White House, which declined to comment, saying the presidents remarks spoke for themselves.Lets look at the votes.There is no dispute Ryan voted for Afghanistan and Iraq war funding; for the major tax cuts enacted under President George W. Bush in 2001 and 2003 (and extended in 2010); and for the new Medicare prescription drug benefit created in 2003.All were big-ticket items.But Obama goes a step further to assert that all were unpaid for. Thats Washington parlance for bills not offset by corresponding spending cuts or tax increases elsewhere in the federal budget.Budget experts we consulted and the historical record confirm there were no direct offsets built into those bills.Obamas claim on the prescription drug bill was slightly different -- that it wasnt paid for and cost as much as my health care bill.Lets break this into two parts.Obama appears to refer to the gross outlays needed for the two landmark bills.For the Medicare prescription drug bill, passed in 2003 and effective in 2006, we found a range of cost estimates for 10 years: $395 billion to $720 billion. The official Congressional Budget Office estimate was the low end.That was at the time. Now, government estimates show the original cost projections were too high, perhaps by as much as 40 percent, said Jon Gabel, senior fellow in health care research at the National Opinion Research Center.Obamas health reform bill -- the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act -- was pricier, with estimates in the $800 billion to $1.4 trillion range. Ryan and Republicans opposed the bill.But the two measures were passed seven years apart, so inflation may be a factor.Paul Van de Water, a former Congressional Budget Office official who is now a senior fellow with the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, did an inflation-adjusted comparison and found the Medicare bill is probably two-thirds or three-quarters the cost of the Obama health care measure.That is, Obamas health care bill is still hundreds of millions of dollars more costly than the Medicare drug bill.So the president was off in equating the gross cost of the bills.On the offset question, the Medicare prescription drug bill, however, indisputably added to the federal deficit. It was not offset by new revenue or other spending cuts.In contrast, the official government estimate of the 2010 health care laws impact said it would actually reduce the deficit, in part because of the new taxes it enacts to help offset the cost of expanding health coverage.The source for that is the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.The CBOs estimate is hardly undisputed -- Ryan, other Republican leaders and various budget analysts have argued that the CBOs report was skewed by questionable assumptions given to it by the Obama administration. They contend the law would actually add to the deficit.Nevertheless, we -- and Congress -- have used CBO estimates as the gold standard on such matters. So Obama has a pretty firm leg to stand on in saying his health bill was paid for while the Medicare bill was not.That covers the details behind the presidents remarks. In this case, its important to put them into their proper context. We consulted several experts and sought Ryans take.Ryan was asked in a recent interview about Obamas citing the Medicare drug program, the two wars and the Bush tax cuts as major drivers of the deficit.He disagreed: We still had these enormous, building, unfunded liabilities, Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security -- I mean, the big drivers of our debt.His office sent us a defense of his votes on war funding, quoting his budget plan: Like all categories of government spending, defense spending should be executed with greater efficiency and accountability. But responsible budgeting must never lose sight of the fact that the first responsibility of the federal government is to provide for the defense of the nation.On the Bush tax cuts, Ryan aides said the congressman believes that we have deficits because Washington spends too much, not because Americans are taxed too little. He says the tax cuts helped fuel economic growth and bring in more tax revenue.Indeed, in December, Obama himself backed a compromise with Republicans, including Ryan, that extended the Bush tax cuts.Bottom line: Ryan has voted for massive new spending and so has the president, said Tad DeHaven, a budget analyst at the libertarian Cato Institute.Iraq war costs have topped $1 trillion, said Scott Lilly, former staff director for the House Appropriations Committee and now a research fellow at the left-leaning Center for American Progress. Neither Bushs war effort in Afghanistan nor Obamas escalation there has been paid for, both analysts noted.In April, both Obama and Ryan unveiled long-term deficit reduction plans in the neighborhood of $4 trillion over a decade or more.So where does this leave us?The president cherry-picked a handful of votes in an effort to show that Ryan is not pristine on the subject of the deficit.Obama got it right on Ryans support for the big-ticket bills, including war funding, Medicare prescription drugs and the Bush tax cuts. He was also on target in saying that none was offset or paid for by spending cuts or tax increases. Thats the main part of his claim.He was off the mark in asserting that one of the bills -- Medicare prescription drugs -- was as costly as his 2010 health care reform bill.That puts him at Mostly True.",0.8,0.2,1.0,0.7,0.1,0.3,0.5,1.0,0.9,Mostly True

Final Rating: Half True  ",A proposed ban on hollow-point bullets and bullets that expand upon impact essentially bans deer hunting.,"In the months following the Sandy Hook school massacre, Wisconsin Democrats moved to restrict access to firearms and ammunition.Those efforts included the drafting of a bill in the state Assembly by Reps. Frederick Kessler, Evan Goyke and Mandela Barnes, all Milwaukee Democrats.Among other things, the bill would restrict sales and possession of hollow-point bullets, a type of ammunition that expands on impact and creates even larger wounds. Authorities said Adam Lanza, the Sandy Hook killer, used bullets designed to inflict maximum damage by breaking up in a victims body. Kessler argued banning such bullets would give the victims of a mass shooting at least a chance of survival.But that bill would have a far greater impact, said conservative talk show host Vicki McKenna on Feb. 18, 2013.It would end deer hunting, a key part of the states culture, said McKenna, whose show is aired in Milwaukee, Madison and LaCrosse.Democrats in Wisconsin want to fight crime by banning deer hunting, McKenna said.She explained that the bill proposed taking hollow-pointed ammunition off the shelves. Which essentially bans deer hunting because you can only use an expanding bullet to deer hunt.That caught our attention. After all, the state sold more than 614,000 licenses as of the start of the gun deer season in November 2012. Thats equivalent to a little more than 10 percent of the states population.So is McKenna right? Would Kesslers bill blow away the gun deer hunt? (Well avoid picking nits and assume the bow hunting season would remain.)We turned to the experts to learn more about bullets and Bambi.The proposed legislationAccording to the Legislative Reference Bureau: This bill prohibits a person, with certain exceptions such as for law enforcement, from selling, transporting, manufacturing, or possessing any hollowpoint bullet, any bullet that expands or flattens easily in the human body, or any bullet with a hard envelope that does not entirely cover the core of the bullet.That bans a lot of bullets.But what does this have to do with deer hunting?We asked Tim Lawhern, the state Department of Natural Resources top official on such matters.For years, state law required hunters of deer and others species to use hollow-point bullets, said Lawhern, administrator of the DNRs enforcement and science division.The law was modified a couple years ago because more and more hunters were hunting with a different sort of ammunition -- often made of solid copper -- that also changed shape on impact, but was not a hollow point.State law now says its illegal to hunt deer with non-expanding bullets.Said Lawhern: It must be the expanding type of ammunition.The idea is that bullets that expand on impact do more damage, cause greater hemorrhaging, and the animal dies in a swifter, more humane manner, Lawhern explained.So Kessler and company want to ban the very kind of bullets that hunters are required to use.What ammo would that leave hunters with?Nothing, said Lawhern. Archery. You could use archery equipment.Banning hollow-point bullets would have a negative impact on deer hunting, said George Meyer, former DNR secretary and executive director of Wisconsin Wildlife Federation.If they dont have any ammunition they could use, it certainly doesnt sound good if youre a hunter, Lawhern said.Legions of hunters would have the same reaction about an expanding-bullet ban, he added.Youll have the largest army in the world saying, What, are you nuts?A change in plansApparently they wont have to worry.Shortly after word got out -- including on McKennas show -- Kessler admitted he and the other lawmakers had shot themselves in the foot.Theyre rewriting the bill to remove any conflicts of law and provide exemptions that honor our states great sporting heritage, Kessler said in a Feb. 19, 2013, statement, a day after McKennas show on the subject.The bill was never intended to conflict with current laws or codes related to Wisconsins rich hunting tradition and those who annually participate in it, Kessler said, adding that the draft bills contained unintended oversights.He added: We will be working with the Legislative Reference Bureau, Legislative Council and the Department of Natural Resources to ensure that any future bill drafts are consistent with current sporting and hunting regulations.Kessler said in an interview that he still wants to limit sales of hollow-point bullets, but with an exemption for hunters.Such ammunition would be available only to people who have licenses to hunt, who are on their way to hunt and its hunting season,  Kessler said.So lets bag this one.McKenna said a proposal to restrict sale and possession of hollow-point and flattening or expanding bullets essentially bans deer hunting.McKennas right on an important front. Deer hunters are required to use bullets that expand on impact -- including hollow points. And Kessler wanted to ban those very bullets. So it would leave gun hunters without bullets.But shes wrong by suggesting that the Democrats were seeking to ban hunting.Kessler admitted hunting never crossed his mind when the bill was drafted in an effort to protect mass shooting victims. The city slickers came up with a bill with a problem that stood out like a white tail between the cross hairs.As it stood, the law would have banned the bullets. But it didnt ban hunting.",0.7,0.6,0.8,0.6,0.2,0.4,0.5,0.8,0.5,Half True

Final Rating: True  ","If you just count all the deaths in the red states, we are number two in the world in deaths, just behind Brazil.","Former President Barack Obama once famously said the pundits like to slice-and-dice our country into red states and blue states -- instead of simply the United States. But in the lead-up to the 2020 presidential election, the candidates themselves are creating these separate countries to make their point about the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. In a campaign stop in Manitowoc on Sept. 21, 2020, Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden struck back at an assertion Republican President Donald Trump had made earlier in the month about coronavirus deaths: That so-called blue states were driving the countrys high death rates. Trump, trying to burnish his performance in combating the virus, had said if those states were removed from the equation, the United States would really be at a very low level of deaths. In Manitowoc, where Biden visited a foundry, he said Trump was wrong. If you just count all the deaths in the red states, we are number two in the world in deaths, just behind Brazil, Biden said. Trump is off track in claiming that U.S. coronavirus deaths, which have topped 200,000, would be low if some states were not counted — an illogical argument from the get-go, because the country cannot be split that way. Biden, meanwhile, is mostly on track in claiming that if red states somehow were split off, they would still account for the second-highest death counts in the world, depending on how you define red and blue states. Lets dig in. When asked for evidence for Bidens claim, a Biden campaign spokesperson pointed to a Sept, 16, 2020, analysis piece from the Washington Post, which tallies virus deaths by which 2016 presidential candidate a state supported. By that analysis, and as of that date, the author wrote, more than 90,000 deaths had occurred in red states, which would have ranked second in the world. The argument holds up even after considering more recent death tolls. The 30 states that Trump took in 2016 had recorded 97,329 deaths in total as of Sept. 28, 2020. Heres the breakdown, according to a New York Times case and death tracker: Alabama, 2,501; Alaska, 52; Arizona, 5,624; Arkansas, 1,329; Florida, 14,036; Georgia, 6,803; Idaho, 460; Indiana, 3,591; Iowa, 1,321; Kansas, 641; Kentucky, 1,195; Louisiana, 5,480; Michigan, 7,052; Mississippi, 2,921; Missouri, 2,119; Montana, 174; Nebraska, 487; North Carolina, 3,468; North Dakota, 237; Ohio, 4,746; Oklahoma, 1,007; Pennsylvania, 8,181; South Carolina, 3,337; South Dakota, 218; Tennessee, 2,362; Texas, 15,854; Utah, 453; West Virginia, 337; Wisconsin, 1,293; Wyoming, 50. If we were to only count these states, the death total as of that date would fit between Brazil at the top of the chart (141,741) and India at number three (95,542), making Bidens claim spot-on. Biden characterized red and blue states in a different way during his speech. Think about what (Trump) is saying. He's saying, if you live in a state like Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania, states with Democratic governors, you're not his problem. He has no obligation to you, the former vice president said. Thats defining blue states as states with Democratic governors, which Trump himself may have been getting at with his comment about blue states, in which, at one point, he cited blue state-managed leadership. It still doesnt make Trumps claim accurate. It does, however, make Bidens a bit less of a bullseye. The 26 states whose governors are currently Republicans had a combined total of 83,695 deaths as of Sept. 28, 2020, behind Brazil and India, coming in third in the world. Heres the breakdown: Alabama 2,501; Alaska, 52; Arizona, 5,624; Arkansas, 1,329; Florida, 14,036; Georgia, 6,803; Idaho, 460; Indiana, 3,591; Iowa, 1,321; Maryland, 3,938; Massachusetts, 9,415; Mississippi, 2,921; Missouri, 2,119; Nebraska, 487; New Hampshire, 439; North Dakota, 237; Ohio, 4,746; Oklahoma, 1,007; South Carolina, 3,337; South Dakota, 218; Tennessee, 2,362; Texas, 15,854; Utah, 453; Vermont, 58; West Virginia, 337; Wyoming, 50. Still, the facts here are clear. No one can split the nation in half based on political parties to spin death counts one way or another. Our death toll is what it is, and it is high — the highest in the world, by more than 50,000. Even when adjusted for population, the United States ranks 11th in the world for total deaths. Biden claimed that the U.S. death total from the coronavirus in red states alone would rank second in the world. Depending on how one interprets red states, this is either spot-on or close to accurate.",1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,True

Final Rating: True  ",Says an average of $4 billion is added to the national debt every day.,"Four billion dollars.Imagine what could be done with that amount of money. MARTA, metro Atlantas mass transit system, has said it could use $4 billion for various expansion projects. The Obama administration has set aside that much money for its Race to the Top education program. Or, perhaps, you can buy the New York Yankees andthe Beatles music catalog and still have about $1 billion to spare.Heres a disturbing figure concerning $4 billion.An average of $4 billion is added to the national debt every day, U.S. Sens. Saxby Chambliss, R-Ga., and Mark Warner, D-Va., wrote in a March 29 op-ed.Is it really that much money? We wanted to find out.The estimate is aimed at raising awareness among Americans into facing and dealing with what the two senators believe is one of the nations biggest problems -- its rapidly rising debt. Chambliss and Warner will come to Atlanta on Monday to talk about the debt to more than 500 business and community leaders at an event hosted by the Rotary Club of Atlanta.The two senators are part of whats been called the Gang of Six -- a group of six senators working on ways to lower the debt. The budget deficit and national debt are big issues in Washington as Democrats and Republicans debate how to best cut spending.Every dollar that we spend simply paying the interest on our nations staggering debt is disappearing into a fiscal sinkhole, they wrote. These are resources that cannot be targeted toward creating jobs, expanding the U.S. economy or addressing any of our other shared priorities.We wondered if Chambliss and Warner had their math right -- or are they trying to scare the public with false and gaudy numbers?PolitiFact Virginia checked out a prior claimin December by Warner that the debt grew by an estimated $15 billion in one weekend. They ruled his claim was on the money.There are two kinds of federal debt and interest -- the debt held by the public and the total debt. About $9.65 trillion -- yes, trillion -- of that debt is held by the public, which includes individuals, companies and state, local and foreign governments, according to the U.S. Treasury Department. The rest, about $4.6 trillion, is held by the Federal Financing Bank, government trust funds, other funds and accounts. The total debt is about $14.25 trillion. Those numbers are as of April 6, 2011, the most recent figures available. The interest on the debt for the federal fiscal year of 2010 was nearly $414 billion, Treasury Department figures show.So, to see how fast the public debt is growing, we looked at the total on two other dates.On Dec. 31, 2010, it was $9.4 trillion. A year earlier, the debt held by the public was $7.8 trillion.Between the end of 2009 and April 6, 2011, the public debt has risen by an average of just above $4 billion a day. In 2010, it grew by an average of $4.3 billion a day. The pace of debt increase does seem to have slowed this year. The debt has risen by $250 billion between the end of 2010 and April 6, an average of $2.6 billion a day.If you look at the total debt, the average daily increase is about $4.3 billion. In 2010, it grew by about $4.7 billion a day. In 2011, the total debt has risen by about $2.45 billion a day.Our math shows the debt has grown by an average of more than $4 billion per day since 2009. It grew by that rate during 2010 as well. The average daily rate has slowed to slightly less than $3 billion so far this year. Either number shows the debt is indeed a big problem.The senators op-ed did not detail what time frame they were discussing to spell out their claim. They said they were basing it off Warners claim that had been checked of what amounted to $5 billion a day and decided to be conservative and chose the $4 billion daily estimate. This year, their claim is off by about $1 billion. Over the last two years, its correct.",1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,True

Final Rating: Mostly True  ","More than 9,000 Rhode Island voters used the Moderate Party master lever mechanism and they didn't have a single Moderate on their ballot.","Rhode Island was among 14 states in the last election cycle that allowed voters to use the so-called master lever, enabling them to vote for candidates from one political party with one ballot mark. On Rhode Island ballots, it is the option called Straight Party.Kenneth Block, founder and chairman of the Moderate Party of Rhode Island, has launched a campaign to get rid of the master lever, saying its outdated and creates confusion for many voters.In a recent appearance on the State of the State television program, Block said that in the November 2012 election, More than 9,000 Rhode Island voters used the Moderate Party master lever mechanism and they didn't have a single Moderate on their ballot.Block, a businessman, gathered enough signatures to get on the ballot in 2010 as the Moderate Partys candidate for governor. He came in last in a four-way race, with 6.5 percent of the votes. But that was enough to win a spot on the 2012 and 2014 ballots for his party.We wanted to know how Block calculated that 9,000 figure.By e-mail, Block said that he started with 9,424 -- the number of people he said voted by the master lever for the Moderate Party. Then he did some estimating, based in part on the size of the communities and districts with a Moderate candidate on the ballot.He noted that the Moderate Party had a candidate in just three communities -- Burrillville, East Greenwich and South Kingstown -- and two legislative districts -- House District 65, in East Providence, and Senate District 16, which is all of Central Falls and a piece of Pawtucket.Block then estimated the number of voters he thought would have cast a straight-party Moderate vote in those communities and districts. He subtracted that estimated total from the total of all Rhode Island voters who selected the Moderate Party with one ballot mark.He didnt provide an exact final number -- just more than 9,000.When we checked Blocks number, we discovered he was close, but not directly on target.To begin with, both the secretary of states office and the Board of Elections said the number of Moderate Party straight-party votes was actually 9,295 -- not the 9,424 Block started with.Then we obtained exact numbers of master-lever votes for the Moderate Party in the communities and districts with Moderates on the ballot .Miguel J. Nunez, planning specialist at the Board of Elections, told us there were 208 such votes in Burrillville, where a Moderate candidate was running for School Committee. But that race was non-partisan and the candidates werent identified by party so, technically, it doesnt fit Blocks definition.In the other communities and legislative districts with identified Moderate candidates on the ballot, there were a total of 642 master-lever votes cast for the party.Subtract that number from the 9,295 statewide votes and you get 8,653 -- close to 350 fewer than Blocks more than 9,000. Even if you add the 208 votes from Burrillville, you still dont get to 9,000.Our rulingKenneth Block said, More than 9,000 Rhode Island voters used the Moderate Party master lever mechanism and they didn't have a single moderate on their ballot.He derived that number in part from guesswork. But according to the precise figures from the Board of Elections, he was off by nearly 350 -- roughly 4 percent.But Blocks underlying point that the master lever confuses many voters is valid. More than 8,000 used it to vote for Moderate Party candidates when there werent any on their ballots.For those reasons, we rule his claim Mostly True.(If you have a claim youd like PolitiFact Rhode Island to check, e-mail us at [emailprotected].

Final Rating: Mostly True  ",We will not ask for a tax increase to run city government.,"Its all about the schools, Memphis Mayor A C Wharton said the day before his administration made its first budget proposal to the City Council since Memphians, in another Wharton landslide, elected him to what is technically his first full four-year term as the citys CEO.Wharton said that while Memphians would be paying more in property taxes than they did for the 2011-12 fiscal year, it was because of the court-mandated funding of Memphis City Schools. He was asking for the City Council to set a total tax rate of $3.66 per $100 of assessed value, up from the current $3.19.In practical terms, that means taxes on a $150,000 home would jump to $1,372.09 annually, up $176.25 from the current $1,195.84.And yet, while Wharton freely acknowledges hes asking for a tax increase, he claims core city government services would be funded with the same amount of property tax revenues in FY 2013 as they were in FY 2012.It's all about the schools, Wharton said. We will not ask for a tax increase to run city government. The budget I present will be clear. We'll operate city government on the same amount we used last year.Wharton explains the apparent contradiction -- taxpayers paying more taxes but funding the same amount of government -- by pointing to the $65 million the city is required to give to MCS for one final year. The citys schools are being transferred to Shelby County after the 2012-13 school year, at which point the citys court-ordered obligation to help MCS with its nearly $900 million budget will end.*Wharton and his finance director, Roland McElrath, agreed to an interview to defend the mayors claims.For the 2012 budget year, when the property tax rate was $3.19 per $100 of assessed value, the city allocated only 18 cents for the schools -- the remaining $3.01 was for the general fund that finances government. The city cobbled together the remainder of the approximately $74.2 million needed for its portion of school funding in other ways. For one example, the city generated $20 million through a refinancing of its debt service.But for the 2013 budget year, Wharton wants a straightforward payment to schools to flow directly out of property taxes -- and since each penny of the tax rate generates $1 million in revenue, the city claims it is simply adding 0.47 to the 0.18 that was allocated for schools last year to get to 0.65. Add that 0.65 to the 3.01 and you get the 3.66 property tax rate Wharton proposes. Another way to think of it: Wharton is saying that the first 301 pennies on the tax rate for FY 2013 will go to fund city government with the remainder going to schools, just like the first 301 pennies on the tax rate for 2012 were allocated to fund city government with the remainder going to schools.Its important to note that the city draws revenues from many areas, including various other taxes and fees, but property taxes are by far the citys single-largest source of revenues, representing around half the citys budget.Jim Strickland, the budget chairman for the City Council, is among those asking Wharton to find ways to cut government services to lessen the impact on taxpayers. Strickland believes the mayor should do more to lower taxes, saying this is the third tax increase hes asked for since winning a special election in 2009 to finish out the final 27 months of Willie Herentons fifth term.But he said Whartons framing of the issue is technically accurate, even if it essentially allows him to shift blame for the spike in taxes: In that direct quote, Im pretty sure hes right.McElrath and Wharton did acknowledge this -- their budget proposal calls for $22 million more in spending on those core non-schools government services. The budget proposal for FY 2013 calls for $628 million in spending on non-schools government services; current projections for FY 2012 show $606 million in spending on non-schools government services.That reflects increases in spending in public safety, especially in the police division where the administration has every incentive to back police director Toney Armstrong in his second full year as chief. But Wharton said the budget also recommends serious cuts -- for instance, closing some libraries and a golf course and scaling back hours at some community centers and city pools. Wharton had the finance department send documents showing how spending trends in city government are all related to more money for public safety but less for everything else.To Strickland, Wharton is masking his decision to increase spending and avoid some difficult cuts by telling taxpayers that 65 cents of the tax rate is going directly to schools.The point is, it doesnt matter what you are asking for, its hitting the taxpayer in the same way, Strickland said. (EDITOR'S NOTE:UPDATE: The original version of this story included a claim from Strickland that Whartons proposed tax rate would be the highest weve ever had. We removed that quote because the administrations budget shows that the overall tax rate for FY 1980 for Memphis was, in fact, 3.74 -- higher thanWharton's proposed 3.66 this year.)Our rulingMemphiss mayor says that a property tax increase is not in fact a tax increase to fund core government services. Rather, its a one-time assessment to cover the citys final year of court-ordered funding obligations for the citys dissolving school system.Whartons finance team was able to create a budget allocating the various revenues so that the amount of the property-tax rate going to fund general government services is the same for 2013 as it was in 2012. But because the budget shows overall government spending increasing by $22 million -- about 3.6 percent -- that bit of needed clarification means the Truth-O-Meter dial points to Mostly True.-------------*In 2011, MCS and the City Council voted to surrender the systems charter, and voters concurred in a referendum asking to transfer control of Memphis public schools to Shelby County.",0.5,0.5,1,0.5,0,0.5,0.5,1,0.5,Mostly True

Final Rating: Mostly True  ",Simply being in this country without documentation is not a crime,"Albany Mayor Kathy M. Sheehan said in a national television interview that its not a crime for immigrants to live in the U.S. without documentation. Sheehan, a Democrat, was defending her citys status as a so-called sanctuary cityto Fox News host Tucker Carlson. The city's law enforcement officials donot report undocumented immigrants to federal authorities unless they commit a serious crime. Simply being in this country without documentation is not a crime,Sheehan said. The U.S. Supreme Court has said that. Carlson was left baffled. You just said that being here illegally is not illegal? Im not aware of that Supreme Court decision, Carlson said. How is that true? Sheehan cited a court ruling. In Arizona v. the United States, the Supreme Court said simply being here undocumented is not a crime, she said. There are civil violations and then there are criminal violations. So, whos right? Sheehan or Carlson? Whats Sheehan talking about? The Supreme Court case Sheehan cited involved a 2010 challenge to an Arizona immigration law from the Obama administration. The law required that immigrants carry documents proving their status in Arizona. Police were also instructed to stop and seek documents from anyone they suspected of being undocumented. Those without documents faced a state criminal charge. The Obama administration contended Arizona could not create a state level criminal charge for the violation because its already regulated by Congress. The Supreme Court agreed with the Obama administration and struck down that section of the Arizona law, among other parts. Civil or criminal Experts supported Sheehans claim by pointing out how the U.S. legal system works. People who break the law in the U.S. have committed either a criminal or civil violation depending on how the law defines it and how prosecutors choose to proceed. Being in the U.S. without documentation is considered a civil matter, said Nancy Morawetz, professor of clinical law at New York University School of Law. Being present in the U.S., that status, is not a crime, Morawetz said. That doesnt mean undocumented immigrants can live in the U.S. without consequence, said Rick Su, a professor at the University at Buffalo School of Law. Federal authorities can deport them. A criminal violation comes with a punishment, like time in prison. Civil cases come with penalties instead. Deportation is considered a penalty under federal law, not a punishment. Congress can decide what they want to make a crime and what they want to make a civil violation, Su said. What theyve decided is that immigration violations by themselves are civil violations. The Supreme Court confirmed that decision in Arizona v. United States. What the Supreme Court said in Arizona v. U.S. is that generally being unlawfully present in the U.S. is not a crime, and thats definitely true, Su said. What the court did, is say Congress had made these civil violations and Arizona is trying to make them criminal violations. Why a civil matter? Its easier to deport undocumented immigrants through civil proceedings, Su said. In deportation proceedings, immigrants face a special immigrant judge. The government does not have to provide a public attorney to immigrants who cannot afford one in these cases. The burden is then entirely on the immigrant to show they are in the country lawfully. They are also not entitled to any kind of due process. There are some immigration laws that can land an immigrant in criminal court. Entering the U.S. illegally is a crime, for example, but staying after a temporary visa has expired is a civil violation. As much as two-thirds of undocumented immigrants in the U.S. entered legally with a visa,according to the Center for Migration Studies. Our ruling Sheehan said simply being in this country without documentation is not a crime. It may be semantics, but Sheehan is right. Living in the U.S. without documentation is a civil violation, not a crime. PolitiFact Floridarated a similar claim Mostly True earlier this year. As its fact check noted, however, those in the U.S. without documentation may have committed a crime by entering the country illegally. Mark Krikorian, executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies, a group that generally opposes loosening immigration laws, told PolitiFact Florida that it's easy for such individuals to run into separate criminal problems even beyond their method of entry, such as filling out an employment eligibility form to get a job when they arent eligible to work. But their illegal presence is not a crime. Sheehan's statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information.",1.0,0.0,1.0,0.8,0.0,0.0,0.3,1.0,0.9,Mostly True

Final Rating: Mostly True  ",The United States has the highest corporate tax rate in the free world.,"Pundits dont just disagree about what tax rates should be; they also disagree about how high they actually are. On Fox Newss The Five, hosts Bob Beckel and Eric Bolling came down on either side while discussing how the economy has fared under President Barack Obama. America has the most number of deductions available to corporations, Beckel said. They pay lower taxes than a lot of European countries do, and under Obama, I have not seen corporate taxes go up all that much. Just to fact-check you a little bit, responded Bolling, we have the highest corporate tax rate in the free world. Beckel repeated his point, then Bolling pointed towards Pfizer and Burger King going overseas for what he called tax inversion. Theyre going there specifically to capture a lower corporate income tax, said Bolling. We separately checked Beckels claim about deductions, but in this check, well see whether Bolling is correct that the United States corporate tax rate ranks as the highest in the free world. The rate in theory We decided to focus on the countries that belong to the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development, a group that includes most advanced, industrialized nations. That fits our bill for a proxy for the free world. Out of the 34 countries in the OECD, America ranks first with a 39.1 percent corporate tax rate, compared to an OECD average of 24.1 percent. The OECD figure is whats called the statutory rate, meaning the base rate applied to corporate profits. According to the Tax Foundation, two non-OECD countries -- the United Arab Emirates (55 percent) and Chad (40 percent) -- have a greater statutory rate than the United States. But the UAE is governed by a monarchy and Chad is a developing country, so we dont think they would fit into the free world category Bolling used. The rate in practice PolitiFact, our sister site, has looked at several variations on Bollings claim and ruled them Mostly True almost every time. The reason for the mostly qualifier is that companies arent actually taxed at the statutory rate. Tax deductions -- on health insurance, pensions, and investment returns, for example -- allow corporations to reduce the pool of taxable profits. So economists often look at what they call the effective tax rate, which experts have told us is just as valid a measurement of corporate tax rates as the statutory rate. But whereas the statutory rate is relatively straightforward and uncontroversial, different, reputable organizations have published very different estimates of the effective tax rate that corporations pay. The most recent estimate comes from the World Bank and International Finance Commission, which put the United States effective rate for 2014 at 27.9 percent. Thats second-highest behind New Zealand among OECD countries and 15th-highest among the 189 countries measured. In 2011, the Tax Foundation published a survey of 13 prior estimates of the United States effective tax rate from 2005 to 2011. All 13 studies pegged the U.S.s rate as above average, but none had the U.S. rate first overall. Another 2011 study by the Congressional Research Service put the U.S. effective rate at 27.1 percent, slightly lower than the OECD average of 27.7 percent. Taxes are convoluted Different studies disagree on effective corporate tax rates because corporate tax rates tend to vary widely depending on the industry, said Alan Viola, resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute. The biggest deduction that varies across countries is how generous the depreciation schedule is, said Alan Viard, resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute. When a business does an investment, equipment, a building, they dont normally get to deduct the whole cost that year. They have to do it over time. Faster is better, said Viard, but depreciation rates vary depending on what types of equipment a company is buying. Many studies also dont account for what the United States classifies as S-corporations, meaning businesses that pay tax through the individual income-tax system rather than the corporate income-tax system, Viard said. This represents about 30 percent of American companies, he said. So while effective tax rates are a good estimate of the corporate tax burden in the United States, particular businesses burden may vary. Our ruling Bolling said the United States has the highest corporate tax rate in the free world. He was referring to the statutory rate, meaning the rate before deductions. On that score, hes right: The United States does have the highest statutory rate among developed countries. However, the United States corporate tax rate doesnt appear to be the highest once deductions and other exclusions are taken into account. So Bolling is correct by one valid definition.",1.0,0.2,1.0,0.8,0.0,0.1,0.5,1.0,0.6,Mostly True

Final Rating: Mostly True  ",Says Donald Trump has bankrupt four separate businesses.,"U.S. Sen. Mark Warner says presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton has a lot of ammunition to fire at Donald Trumps business record. To think that Mr. Trump is trying to lay out this proposition that hes a successful business guy. Hes failed miserably, bankrupt four separate businesses, Warner, D-Va., said during a June 21 interview on CNN. We looked at Warners contention that Trump bankrupted four businesses. Clinton has made similar charges against the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, including on July 6 when she spoke in front of the shuttered Trump Plaza Casino and Hotel in Atlantic City, N.J.. Earlier this year, many of Trumps GOP primary opponents also accused him of running businesses into the ground. Kevin Hall, Warners communications director, sent us a series of media reports about Trumps business problems. Some Trump companies indeed have sought protection under Chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy law, which shields businesses from creditors as as they reorganize with hope of remaining open. Under court supervision, the companies devise a plan to pay back some of its liabilities over time. Thats different from a Chapter 7 filing, which involves liquidating a companys assets and distributing the proceeds to creditors. PolitiFact National has explored several claims about Trumps business record and has tallied a list of bankruptcies for his companies. Lets take a look. 1991 bankruptcy Trumps first bankruptcy came when he sought protection for the Trump Taj Mahal in Atlantic City. Trump funded most of the casinos $1 billion construction by using junk bonds with high interest rates, according to the Philadelphia Inquirer. When it sought Chapter 11 protection a year after its opening, the casino had about $3 billion in debt. As part of the restructuring, Trump cut his ownership stake in the Taj Mahal by half and sold his airline as well as his personal 282-foot yacht, The Washington Post said in an August 2015 story. 1992 bankruptcies Two more of Trumps Atlantic City casinos - the Trump Castle and Trump Plaza and Casino - sought Chapter 11 protection amid heavy debt and cash flow problems, United Press International reported at the time. A fourth bankruptcy also occurred in 1992 when Trump sought protection for The Plaza hotel in midtown Manhattan. The hotel, which Trump bought for $390 million in 1988, had accumulated more than $550 million in debt. Trump gave up a 49 percent ownership stake and remained CEO, although he had little control over the day-to-day operations of the company, according to The New York Times. Most recent bankruptcies Trump Hotels and Casinos Resorts filed for bankruptcy in 2004 when his casinos - including the Trump Taj Mahal, Trump Marina and Trump Plaza in Atlantic City, and a riverboat casino in Indiana - amassed an estimated $1.8 billion in debt, according to The Associated Press. Trump agreed to reduce his share in the company from 47 percent to 27 percent in a restructuring plan, but he still was the companys largest single shareholder and remained in charge of its operations. Several years later, Trump Entertainment Resorts - formerly Trump Hotels and Casinos Resorts - was slammed by the Great Recession and missed a $53.1 million interest payment in December 2008, according to ABC News. The company declared Chapter 11 in February 2009. After negotiating with the board of directors, Trump resigned as the companys chairman and had his corporate stake in the company reduced to 10 percent. The company continued to use Trumps name in licensing. All told, the record shows that three of Trumps Atlantic City casinos as well as The Plaza hotel went bankrupt in the 1990s. His overall casino and resort company went bankrupt twice in the 2000s while operating under different names. So you could argue that five Trump companies have gone into bankruptcy. Beyond the numbers The next question: Is Trump personally to blame for driving these ventures into bankruptcy, as Warners statement says? Trump defends his use of bankruptcy laws, saying theyve allowed him to keep businesses afloat and that hes rarely relied on them during a career of making hundreds of business deals. In a statement released the day Clinton made her Atlantic City trip, Trump pegged the number of bankruptcies at four.  It is an effective and commonly used practice in business to use bankruptcy proceedings to restructure a business and ultimately save jobs, Trump said in a July 6 statement.  Experts told PolitiFact National last September that Trump has had a high number of bankruptcies. But they didnt entirely blame him for the Chapter 11 filings and noted that most occurred in the gambling industry, which has struggled. A 1991 article by United Press International about the financial woes of the Trump Castle and Trump Plaza and Casino said the Atlantic City gaming industry was depressed and that nine of the citys 12 casinos saw declining revenues in 1990, with those two Trump casinos seeing the biggest revenue losses. The New York Times noted in a story earlier this month that Trumps share of the overall Atlantic City casino market started to fall in 1997, and that while revenues for non-Trump gaming ventures in the city rose over the following five years, revenue at Trump casinos declined. Trump told the newspaper that his casinos ran into trouble because they began competing against each other - a statement that The Times said was a tacit acknowledgement that he overbuilt. Roger Gros, publisher of Global Gaming Business magazine, told the Los Angeles Times last year that Trump put his Atlantic City casinos in so much debt that subsequent managers couldn't manage them properly. But Michael Viscount, an Atlantic City lawyer who represented unsecured creditors during the 2004 Chapter 11 filing of the Trump Hotels and Casino resorts, doesnt blame Trump for the bankruptcies. He told Forbes magazine in 2011 that he didnt blame Trump for his Atlantic City casino bankruptcies. Viscount said creditors knew what they were getting into when they lent Trump money. Theyve all played this game before, in the insolvency space. The company that possessed his name filed bankruptcy because it was overleveraged, Viscount told Forbes. What does that tell you? People want to lend him money. He does grandiose things with it. Adam Levitin, a law professor at Georgetown University, said in an August 2015 post on a blog dedicated to bankruptcy and credit issues that a Chapter 11 filing alone doesnt demonstrate a lack of business acumen. Sometimes businesses go bankrupt because of poor management, but sometimes its because of factors beyond their control, Levitin wrote. And indeed, how much, if at all, was Trump involved in the management of the companies? Levitin wrote. I wouldn't be shocked if he was basically licensing his name. Levitin told PolitiFact National last September that its not fair to put all the blame on Trump for his companys bankruptcies because hes acted as any investor would. Investors often own many non-integrated companies, which they fund by taking on debt, and some of them inevitably file for bankruptcy, Levitin said. The only difference is that Trump puts his name on his companies, which means people associate them with him, but he's not at all the leader in the bankruptcy space, Levitin said. These bankruptcies were not defining moments for Trump and shouldn't color our view of him. Our ruling Warner said Trump has bankrupt four separate businesses. The number, if anything, is conservative. We count five. But beyond the number, Warners statement also asserts that Trump was the cause of the bankruptcies, and thats harder to parse out. Theres no doubt he had a role in many of the failings, having larded his casino operations with huge debts. But analysts note that Trump wasnt acting alone; he had willing investors who put up big sums of money in the risky gaming industry. Theres also questions about how involved he was in running all of the casinos that bore his name.",1.0,0.2,1.0,0.8,0.1,0.2,0.5,1.0,0.8,Mostly True

To read the others, click here. El Paso Democrat Beto ORourke, who announced Thursday that he is running for president, had been teasing a presidential bid for weeks. Speculation about his intentions prompted the conservative Club for Growth to release a television ad looking to weaken enthusiasm for ORourke among Democratic primary voters. The ad argues that ORourke has coasted through life due to white male privilege and that he is a far cry from former President Barack Obama, as many have drawn comparisons between the two Democrats. Obama went on to become the first African American editor of the Harvard Law Review, breaking barriers, the ad says. Beto crashed into them, causing a collision while driving drunk, then fleeing the scene to avoid accountability. Club for Growth provided a fact sheet detailing the source for each statement in the advertisement. Sources include newspaper articles and other sources online. ORourke did not return a request for comment. OUR PROCESS: Read howPolitiFact checks everyone. Police report details accident We looked at this incident in September last year and earlier, after allegations about his 1998 arrest were made during his 2018 Senate campaign and his 2012 congressional campaign. Here are the facts: ORourke was arrested in 1998 for driving while intoxicated in Anthony, a small town in El Paso County. A witness told police officers that they saw ORourke driving at a high speed on I-10 before losing control of his car and striking a truck traveling in the same direction, according to a police report of the incident published by the Houston Chronicle. The truck was sent across the center median and into the lane moving in the opposite direction. ORourke then attempted to drive away, but the witness stopped him. Law enforcement arrived at the scene and arrested ORourke. Police reported that ORourke recorded a 0.136 and 0.134 on police breathalyzers, above a blood-alcohol level of 0.10, the state legal limit at the time. Our ruling Club for Growth said ORourke crashed into barriers, causing a collision while driving drunk, then fleeing the scene to avoid accountability. A police report of the incident states that ORourke crashed into another car while driving under the influence of alcohol. A witness said he attempted to flee the scene, but was unsuccessful.

Final Rating: True  ","On day one, six people were able to sign up for health insurance through the federal marketplace.","The failed launch of the Obamacare website healthcare.gov continued to draw plenty of attention Nov. 3, 2013, on the Sunday morning talk shows. Jan Crawford, CBS legal correspondent, said the websites collapse stood out even more in light of the hype that led up to the opening day. With great fanfare they pointed to that date, Crawford said on Face the Nation. They had health care clinics across the country signing people up for appointments that day to get people in for this promise of affordable health care. On day one, six people were able to sign up. We wondered, was it true that just six people were able to successfully enroll in plans offered through the federal insurance marketplace created as part of the new health care law? Thats what well look into. For the most part, Crawford got it right. The figure of six people comes from documents released by the House committee investigating the failed rollout of Obamacare. The documents are copies of notes taken by staff at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, the agency in charge of the website project. At the top of the notes are the words War room. They were written two and three days after the site opened for business on Tuesday, Oct. 1. An entry from a meeting on Wednesday morning said six enrollments have occurred so far. By the end of the second day, the notes reported 248 people had signed up and about 40,000 applications were pending. A spokesperson for the U.S. Health and Human Services Department told reporters that these were not official numbers and that people could also enroll through other means, including filling out paper applications. Some states are also operating their own insurance marketplaces. Joanne Peters, Health and Human Services spokeswoman, told Bloomberg that by the last week of October, about 700,000 people had submitted applications, with about half coming through the federal marketplace and half coming through the states. There were ongoing issues with sending enrollment information to insurance companies, Peters said. Official numbers might be released by mid November. Our ruling Crawford said that only six people had been able to sign up on the first day of open enrollment for the federal health insurance marketplace. That fits with the internal notes released by the House committee. But those were initial numbers and there is some possibility that other people could have enrolled without using the website. Official numbers are not available.",1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,True

Final Rating: Mostly True  ","Despite attention on global warming, fewer Americans carpool today to work than carpooled in 1980 and SUVs have never been a larger proportion of the vehicles being sold in this country.","The two-week climate conference now under way in Paris, where President Barack Obama hopes for an international agreement to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, has generated attacks from conservatives such as syndicated columnist George Will. On Nov. 30, 2015, the first day of the United Nations gathering, Will made a two-part claim that we want to check. He made the statement on Fox News Special Report, and it was replayed the next day by Milwaukee radio talk show host Charlie Sykes, whose guests are nearly always fellow conservatives. Despite 30 years of propaganda about global warming, Will stated, fewer Americans carpool today to work than carpooled in 1980. SUVs have never been a larger proportion of the vehicles being sold in this country. The American people may profess occasionally to be concerned about global warming, but their behavior tells you that none of this propaganda has had any effect. The size of the cars Americans drive and how often they carpool are only two ways in which people produce greenhouse gases -- those such as carbon dioxide from vehicles that trap heat in the atmosphere and, scientists believe, contribute to global warming. But lets see how clean Wills claim is. Greenhouse gases A little first on greenhouse gases. When Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker stated in September 2015 that the Obama administrations own Environmental Protection Agency has said its Clean Power Plan will have a marginal impact on climate change (Half True), we noted that the United States and China are considered the worlds top greenhouse gas polluters. And as PolitiFact National reported the same month, the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has said it is extremely likely that humans are causing climate change, and very likely that greenhouses gases are the driver.  Weve also noted that according to the EPA, greenhouse gas emissions from vehicles in the United States amount to 27 percent of all sources of greenhouse gases, second only to electric power generation. Now to the first part of Wills claim. Carpooling The latest census figures show that slightly more than 9 percent of Americans carpooled to work in 2014. As Will suggested, thats down from nearly 20 percent in 1980, which was the first census to survey about carpooling. Driving alone rose from 64.4 percent to 76.5 percent. Among the reasons, according to experts: The rate of car ownership has risen, work schedules are less predictable, more people work from home and busier Americans want more freedom in managing their commutes with other tasks, such as getting kids to soccer practice. The other part of Wills statement, however, goes off road a bit. SUVs Well note that, strictly speaking, there are traditional sport-utility vehicles, such as the Jeep Grand Cherokee and Dodge Durango, which are built on a truck platform; and the newer crossover-utility vehicles, which are built on a car chassis. They include the Honda CR-V and the Buick Encore. Traditional SUVs peaked with a 17 percent market share in 2002, according to the Ann Arbor, Mich.-based Center for Automotive Research, an independent research group. In 2014, they made up only 7.1 percent of all new vehicle sales. But many people, as well as automotive experts, refer to both types of vehicles simply as SUVs. The car site Edmunds.com told us that SUVs have reached their highest-ever market share in 2015, at 35.5 percent of sales. And the Center for Automotive Research provided us similar figures. In 2014, traditional SUVs and crossovers accounted for 34 percent of new-vehicle sales, as high as any year going back to 1995. Our rating Will said that despite attention on global warming, fewer Americans carpool today to work than carpooled in 1980 and SUVs have never been a larger proportion of the vehicles being sold in this country. Will is correct on carpooling to work and essentially correct on SUVs, when taking into account both traditional SUVs and the smaller crossover vehicles. But its worth noting that the market share for the traditional SUVs is down from its peak in 2002. ",0.7,0.5,1.0,0.7,0.0,0.5,0.6,1.0,0.6,Mostly True

Final Rating: True",I have filed every disclosure that has ever been required.,"The race for the Democratic nomination for Georgias next secretary of state has turned downright ugly.A June 27 debate on Georgia Public Broadcasting between the five Democratic candidates seeking the partys nomination turned into little more than a prime-time mudslinging. The debate was sponsored by the Atlanta Press Club. State Sen. Gail Buckner (D-Jonesboro) quickly found herself on the defensive when she was accused of not filing a personal financial disclosure report as required by the state Ethics Commission. Challenger Gary Horlacher alleged Buckner had not filed within the seven days required after she qualified to run for statewide office. Buckner, a 18-year veteran of the state Legislature, shot back that she had. Buckner was in the state House of Representatives 16 years and has served two in the state Senate. I have filed every disclosure that has ever been required, she said. So whos right?Horlacher, a metro Atlanta attorney, said Buckner was required to file a personal financial disclosure report within seven days after she qualified to run for secretary of state. But the only disclosure she filed was back in January, before she qualified to run for statewide office. She qualified to run for secretary of state in April.The state Ethics Commission Web site has this to say about the required filing:A Personal Financial Disclosure Statement covering the period of the preceding calendar year shall be filed no later than the fifteenth day following the date of qualifying as a candidate. Candidates for statewide office file not later than seven days after qualifying for office. Only one Personal Financial Disclosure Statement is required per calendar year.That seems clear-cut. But not so much in this case, according to Stacey Kalberman, executive secretary for the Ethics Commission. Kalberman said Buckner filed a statewide form earlier this year that effectively covers her subsequent decision to run for secretary of state. That fulfills the Ethics Commissions requirements, Kalberman said.She filed a statewide form in January, so shes good, Kalberman said. A check of the Ethics Commissions Web site shows Buckner electronically filed the form on Jan. 8 at 8:04 p.m. It lists everything from Buckners salary, to the value of her home and vehicles. Horlacher said he still thinks Buckner has violated the letter and intent of the filing requirement. And he vowed not to drop the issue.I am down to deciding whether to formally request an advisory opinion from the [Ethics] Commission, he said. I think the state might be better off just to get clarification on this so it is not repeated. But as of now, Buckner appears to have done what is required of her.

Final Rating: True  ","Since that famous day in February where the governor campaigned with Barack Obama on behalf of the stimulus program, 211,000 Floridians have lost their jobs.","You knew it wouldn't take long for the hug to get some love during Sunday's debate between Republicans Marco Rubio and Charlie Crist. Minutes into the 40-minute Florida Senate Showdown, Rubio made a case that he'll stand up to President Barack Obama's agenda and Crist won't.Everyone knows that you won't stand up to the Obama agenda because just a year ago you were campaigning for it, the former House speaker said, referring to Feb. 10, 2009, when Crist embraced the president at a Fort Myers campaign event for the federal stimulus package.We've fact-checked several claims about Crist's support for the stimulus. Indeed, he earned a Pants on Fire rating for saying he didn't endorse it. So it was a Rubio comment later in the program that drew our attention. FOX News Sunday host Chris Wallace asked Rubio, Why is $8 billion and 87,000 jobs bad for a state that has 12 percent unemployment?Well ... if it's bad for America, it can't possibly be good for your state, Rubio said. Let me tell you why the stimulus has failed. The stimulus has failed because since that famous day in February where the governor campaigned with Barack Obama on behalf of the stimulus program, 211,000 Floridians have lost their jobs.211,000 is a big number, so we wanted to check Rubio's facts.Conveniently, the state's Agency for Workforce Innovation released a report on state employment figures just two days before the debate. In it, Florida's record 12.2 percent unemployment rate is announced, along with many statistics on the state's jobs picture, including year-over-year numbers from February 2009, the month Crist campaigned with Obama. The report shows Florida had 8,356,000 jobs in February 2009 and 8,125,000 in February 2010, the difference being 231,000. These are the seasonally adjusted numbers for the civilian population.However, if you look at seasonally adjusted nonagricultural employment --- a less-inclusive number --- you see the basis for Rubio's claim. There the job loss in a year's time is 211,500.It's the latter number that the Rubio campaign points to. Spokesman Alberto Martinez also shared a report from House Way and Means Republicans that seeks to highlight the stimulus as a job-killer, rather than a job creator, where Florida is said to have lost 240,400 jobs since the stimulus passed.Like any statistics, these are easily sliced and diced to make the key point. But Rubio is very close to the precise number, and in fact, he underestimates it slightly when his point is that Florida has lost a lot of jobs.

In the meeting, James McAdams, the Department of Revenue's property tax oversight program director, gave an update on property tax collections across Florida.According to McAdams, Florida property taxes collected between 2007 and 2009 dropped by $2.28 billion, or 7.5 percent, the Associated Press reported.McAdams was unable to delineate how much of the drop was attributed to tax reforms implemented by the Legislature, and how much was a result of falling property values.I would classify that as dropping like a rock, said Senate Finance and Taxation Committee Chairman Thad Altman, R-Viera.Altman's comment prompted a response from Crist during his televised remarks in front of a joint session of the Legislature.Sen. Altman, we agree that does, indeed, qualify as 'dropping like a rock,'  Crist said.The Department of Revenue's 2009 annual report, meanwhile, included an even bigger reduction. The annual report said property tax collections fell from $31.04 billion in 2007, to $28.14 billion in 2009. That's a $2.9 billion decrease in three years. (See page 32 of the report).In his State of the State address, Crist said 2009 property taxes were almost $3 billion below 2007 property taxes. A report prepared for a Senate committee pegs the number at about $2.28 billion and the Department of Revenue's annual report pegs the number at $2.9 billion. With the qualifier almost, that's close enough not to distort the broader point.",1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,True

Final Rating: True  ","In Afghanistan, over 100 billion dollars spent on military contracts.","The debate over how the United States left Afghanistan, and the chaos it created, will likely last for years. So will the debate over the war itself, and whether nearly 20 years of deployment was worth it. Lt. Gov. Mandela Barnes of Wisconsin, one of at least 10 Democrats hoping to win the seat held by Republican U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson, made his position clear in an Aug. 16, 2021 tweet: Thousands of American lives lost, plus over 100,000 Afghan civilians and military personnel. Over 100 billion dollars spent on military contracts. And for what? The cost in human lives has been well documented. Here are the stark totals as reported that same day by The Associated Press: American service members killed in Afghanistan through April: 2,448. U.S. contractors: 3,846. Afghan national military and police: 66,000. Other allied service members, including from other NATO member states: 1,144. Afghan civilians: 47,245. Taliban and other opposition fighters: 51,191. Aid workers: 444. Journalists: 72. Those casualty totals tragically increased August 26, 2021, when a suicide bomber attacked crowds of Afghans flocking to Kabuls airport. The attacks killed at least 169 Afghans and 13 U.S. troops, Afghan and U.S. officials said. The death toll could rise as authorities examine the scene. On August 30, 2021, the last plane carrying U.S. forces left Afghanistan after 20 years of war. But were focused on the second part of Barnes tweet, and his claim about money spent on military contracts. Has more than $100 billion dollars been spent on military contracts? Lets take a look. When asked for back up for the statement, Barnes spokesman Christian Slater pointed us to a April 23, 2021 Bloomberg Law report which found that Since 2002, the Pentagon has spent $107.9 billion on contracted services in Afghanistan, a Bloomberg Government analysis shows. Contractor support includes lodging, laundry, private security, mechanics, food, transportation, equipment maintenance, and fuel, according to the article. Texas-based Fluor was the biggest defense contractor in Afghanistan. The Defense Department had spent $3.8 billion for Fluors work in Afghanistan since 2015, federal records show, mainly for logistics services, according to an Associated Press report. A Bloomberg report noted that in April 2021, 16,832 workers were employed by contractors in Afghanistan, with 6,147 of them being U.S. citizens. That was more than double the remaining 2,500 U.S. troops at the time. According to a July 21, 2021 US News & World Report article, the number of contractors in Afghanistan dropped over the previous three months from nearly 17,000 in April to 7,800 in July. Here is Bloombergs list of top Department of Defense contractors for fiscal years 2016-2021.  Fluor Corp.: $3.1 billion Amentum Parent Holdings: $1.7 billion Columbia Helicopters: $970 million PAE: $930 million Raytheon Technologies: $830 million Secure Movement Logistics: $680 million National Fuel: $480 million Boeing Co.: $400 million Bravura Information Tech.: $310 million FedEx Corp.: $310 million Waste and fraud reported To be sure, all that money was not spent without controversy -- or even all spent appropriately. In an August 2021 report on Afghanistan Reconstruction, Special Inspector General John F. Sopko, noted that fraud and financial waste was rampant: Because contract work was often performed with little to no oversight, waste and fraud often went virtually unchecked. In 2012, GAO reported that a number of new, contractor- built facilities had to be repaired or completely rebuilt because oversight personnel were unable to adequately measure contractors performance, resulting in wasted resources, low morale, and risks to safety of base and installation personnel where the deficient guard towers, fire stations, and gates were constructed.  Congress created the inspector generals office as an independent agency focused on the Afghanistan mission and its reconstruction issues. Of the approximately $145 billion the U.S. government spent trying to rebuild Afghanistan, about $83 billion went to developing and sustaining its army and police forces, according to the the office. The $145 billion is in addition to $837 billion the United States spent fighting the war, which began with an invasion in October 2001. Barnes said Over 100 billion dollars spent on military contracts. A Bloomberg Law report found that the Pentagon has spent $107.9 billion on contracted services in Afghanistan. Those contracted services include lodging, laundry, food, transportation, equipment maintenance and fuel. For a statement that is accurate with nothing significant missing, our rating is True.

Final Rating: True  ",Says Mitt Romney has flip-flopped on abortion rights.,"On Fox News Sunday, Texas Gov. Rick Perry said fellow Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney has changed positions on pivotal topics, including abortion rights. You go back through my record for 20-plus years, I have been a consistent conservative, Perry told Chris Wallace on Oct. 30, 2011. Perry said he has always been pro-life, while Romney has been on both sides of that issue. Hes been ... pro-abortion, Perry said. Perry has lobbed flip-flop charges at Romney, a former Massachusetts governor, since soon after entering the presidential race. During a Sept. 22 Republican presidential debate, Perry, in a halting verbal attack, hit that idea hard, saying that Romney previously had stood up for Roe v. Wade before he was against it. Perry was referring to the 1973 landmark Supreme Court ruling that struck down a Texas law prohibiting nearly all abortions and said states could not prohibit a woman from having an abortion before a fetus is viable, the time at which it can survive outside a woman's body. So, has Romney flip-flopped on abortion rights? For another fact-check, PolitiFact National looked into that question. Romney made several statements about abortion rights earlier in his political career. Here are two of his clearest statements about his position: • In a debate during his unsuccessful 1994 challenge to U.S. Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., Romney said, I believe that abortion should be safe and legal in this country. He added: I believe that since Roe v. Wade has been the law for 20 years, it should be sustained and supported. And I sustain and support that law and support the right of a woman to make that choice. • In his successful 2002 campaign for governor, Romney said during a debate, I will preserve and protect a woman's right to choose and am devoted and dedicated to honoring my word in that regard. Those comments — made in public forums eight years apart — struck us as solid evidence that Romney was then an abortion-rights supporter. What about his views today? The issues portion of his website doesnt have a section on abortion, but Romney wrote an op-ed that was posted on the National Reviews website June 18, 2011, presenting his abortion views. It was written after he risked alienating anti-abortion activists by declining to sign a pledge offered by the Susan B. Anthony List, an anti-abortion group. The pledge includes a promise that if the signer becomes president, he will appoint pro-life candidates to head certain federal agencies such as the Justice Department and to advance legislation cutting off funding to Planned Parenthood clinics and other abortion providers. In the op-ed, Romney wrote: I am pro-life and believe that abortion should be limited to only instances of rape, incest, or to save the life of the mother. I support the reversal of Roe v. Wade, because it is bad law and bad medicine. Roe was a misguided ruling that was a result of a small group of activist federal judges legislating from the bench. I support the Hyde Amendment, which broadly bars the use of federal funds for abortions. And as president, I will support efforts to prohibit federal funding for any organization like Planned Parenthood. Romney goes on to say that if he is elected president, he will push for a law to protect unborn children who are capable of feeling pain from abortion and appoint judges who adhere to the Constitution and the laws as they are written, not as they want them to be written. Our ruling Romneys views on abortion rights today are clearly different from what he expressed in 1994 and 2002. Most significantly, Romney earlier voiced support for the Roe decision; now, he says it should be reversed.",1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,True

Final Rating: Half True  ","When the New York State Senate voted to legalize abortion in 1970, 12 Republican senators voted in favor of it.","A leaked draft opinion from Justice Samuel Alito to overturnthe U.S. Supreme Court's landmark abortion rights decision Roe v. Wade has mobilized abortion rights advocates in New York state, where Democratic leaders said that they would maintain access to abortion. State Senate Majority Leader Andrea Stewart-Cousins, D-Yonkers, whospoke to reporters after the draft was leaked, said that when New York state legalized abortion, three years before Roe v. Wade was decided, Republicans held power in the Senateand some of them joined Democrats in supporting a measure to repeal the states ban on abortions. Under a Republican majority in the Senate, those reproductive rights laws were passed, Stewart-Cousins said. And not only was it a Republican majority leadership in the Senate, but 12 Republicans joined the majority of Democrats in order to pass our reproductive rights bills here. Since then, the party has moved to the right on abortion. In 2019, when another abortion bill passed in New York, no Republicans in the state legislature supported it. Stewart-Cousins is right that Republicans supported legalizing abortion in 1970. At the time, Republicans controlled the Senate, the Assembly and the governor's office - but she got the tally wrong by one vote. The New York State Libraryand librarian Michael Meyer sent us photocopies of the Senate vote on bill 8556-A, which was voted on by the Senate on April 10, 1970. A vote on March 18, 1970, in the Senate on a more liberal version of the legislation had an identical tally. Thirteen Republican senators voted for the bill, which passed 31-26. The Senate had 57 districts in 1970. There are 63 districts today. We approached Stewart-Cousins office, and spokesperson Emily Bruggeman sent us a New York Times article stating that in the Senate, the vote was 31 to 26, with 13 Republicans and 18 Democrats in favor, and 20 Republicans and six Democrats voting against it. Stewart-Cousins is correct that Republican leadership in the Senate allowed the bill to come to the floor, though the majority leader at the time, Sen. Earl Brydges of Niagara Falls, was no proponent of abortion. Brydges could have stopped the vote, but he did not. An abortion rights supporter told the New York Times that Brydges miscalculated, that he allowed a vote for a full repeal of the abortion ban, without restrictions, because he did not think it would pass. Brydges reserved his comments during the floor debate for the roll call vote, and he said he was disturbed by the bill. I have kept my word to do nothing to keep this bill from coming to the floor or not to lobby personally against it, Brydges said, according to the New York Times. But I have a deep, real, abiding conviction that this is the wrong way for the state to go because we are a bellwether state and many other states will follow our lead. Gov. Nelson Rockefeller had been calling for changing the states abortion law and signed the measure in 1970. When a repeal of the legalization was passed in 1972, he vetoed it. Stewart-Cousins said that legalization of abortion in New York state was approved with the support of 12 Republicans in the Senate. She missed one vote.Theroll call shows 13 Republicans in the Senate supported the bill.",0.5,0.5,1,0.5,0,0,0.5,1,0.5,Half True

Final Rating: True  ",Says Your kid just ate 16 packs of sugar.,"In recent days weve heard a revival of an age-old question that highlights our nations shared love of sugar yet calls out our regional differences: Is it pop or is it soda? Or maybe its just Coke? While in bubbly debate over what to call soft drinks -- your PolitiFact Oregon staff does not agree on this -- a colleague of ours suggested a potential fact check that anyone might find intriguing, no matter what they call their carbonated beverage of choice. Youve probably seen the Sugar Packs ads around Multnomah County, put there by the Health Department as part of a healthy living and anti-obesity campaign that started in 2010.Its the one with a pile of packets of white sugar draining into a 20-ounce bottle of generic cola. Your kid just ate 16 packs of sugar, the ad states. All those extra calories can bring on obesity, diabetes and heart disease.Sixteen packets? Our collective stomachs cramped. Our teeth ached. We swallowed our distaste and started checking.Soda-sleuthing turned out to be quite easy, namely because theres a lot of pop in a newsroom. In fact, we found more than a dozen empties within spitting distance. A 12-ounce can of Coca-Cola regular, we learned, contains 39 grams of sugar, usually from high-fructose corn syrup in the United States. A 20-ounce bottle would then contain 65 grams of sugar. Corn syrup is not the same as white table sugar, but the county is talking equivalents. A packet of table sugar as shown in the ad is equal to about a teaspoon, or about 4 grams of sugar. So, indeed, there are at least 16 packs of sugar in every 20-ounce bottle of regular cola.Theres no arguing that thats a large chunk of sweet. The American Heart Association recommends no more than nine teaspoons -- nine packets -- of added sugar a day for adult men. For women, its six.But just for the fun of it -- no, were not on a sugar high -- we wanted to know what else could contain the equivalent of 16 packets of granulated white. And bingo: A 16-ounce Jamba Juice Banana Berry contains 60 grams of sugar. A 12-ounce Chocolate McCafe shake from McDonalds has 76 grams.A Starbucks Grande non-fat, no-whip Caramel Frappucino Blended Beverage contains 59 grams of sugar, although to be fair, the drink also includes 4 grams of nutritious protein. The iced lemon pound cake contains 46 grams of sugar -- but then, all you adults knew that -- and PolitiFact Oregon has fallen into tangential research.Back to the point.We figure children dont usually indulge in diet sodas, which are made with artificial sweeteners like aspartame, and not with corn syrup or sugar. Were told by a beverage trade publication that 12-ounce cans are the top sellers -- but a 20-ounce bottle doesnt seem out of line in this age of super-sized drinks and Double Big Gulps.Its whats available in our environment, said Sonia Manhas, who manages the program for the county.After all, McDonalds markets a 16-ounce soda as a small-sized soft drink and a 12-ounce drink as child-sized. We figure parents are smart enough to figure out the sugar-gram-to-cola-ounce ratio themselves. The smaller the drink, the fewer the sugar packets.All this really means is that we find the countys statement accurate. And thats the unsugar-coated truth.",1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,True

Final Rating: True",Says COVID-19 has killed more North Carolinians in a year than the flu has in 10 years.,"Like many states, North Carolina is tracking a record number of COVID-19 cases this holiday season. And in an attempt to explain the severity of the illness, the states top health official compared coronavirus deaths to data on the flu. Sadly more than 5,000 North Carolinians have lost their lives from this virus since our first death on March 12 of this year, Health Secretary Mandy Cohen said during a Dec. 1 press conference. To give some perspective, just under 1,500 people died from the flu in the past 10 years, Cohen said. In just 11 months, Covid has killed more than three times that number. Is it true that the coronavirus has killed more North Carolinians in a year than the flu has in 10 years? According to the states data, yes. North Carolinas Department of Health and Human Services tracks both COVID-19 and influenza deaths. As of Wednesday morning, the state had counted 5,284 COVID-19 deaths. DHHS says those deaths include people who have had a positive molecular or antigen test for COVID-19, who died without fully recovering from COVID-19, and who had no alternative cause of death identified. The deaths are reported by hospitals and clinicians directly to the local and state health departments. The first reported COVID-19 death did, indeed, occur on March 12. The states health department also tracks flu deaths and reports each flu seasons data on its website. Flu deaths are reported by health providers and were confirmed as influenza by an appropriate laboratory or rapid diagnostic test. PolitiFact reviewed the last 10 flu seasons, dating back to the 2010-2011 season. In total, we counted 1,486 reported flu deaths. DHHS spokeswoman Kelly Haight confirmed to us by phone that our total is accurate. Heres a list of the flu death counts by season, and a link to the report for each respective season: 2019-2020: 186 2018-2019: 203 2017-2018: 391 2016-2017: 218 2015-2016: 59 2014-2015: 218 2013-2014: 107 2012-2013: 59 2011-2012: 9 2010-2011: 36 The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention also tracks flu deaths by state. At a glance, it might seem like the CDC and North Carolina reports contradict one other. For instance, the CDC reported North Carolina had 2,064 flu deaths in 2018, while the states health department reported far less. Thats because the CDC sometimes combines flu and pneumonia deaths together, officials said. Under the flu & pneumonia section on the CDCs flu deaths by state website, most of those deaths are pneumonia deaths, said Jeff Lancashire, acting associate director for communications for the CDCs National Center for Health Statistics. Some pneumonia deaths are caused by the flu, but some can be caused by many other viruses, bacteria, bacteria-like organisms and fungi, said Kelly Haight, DHHS spokeswoman. The year 2018 is the most recent year of flu deaths available on the CDC site. If you start in 2018 and look back 10 years to 1999, Lancashire said there were 1,806 deaths from exclusively flu alone – without pneumonia (from the public database CDC WONDER – wonder.cdc.gov). So if Dr. Cohen was citing deaths from flu alone, she would be correct that COVID19 deaths have exceeded that (number) in NC, he said. The CDC has noted, however, that tallying death counts for COVID-19, flu and pneumonia is complicated and sometimes its data can be incomplete. Cohen said COVID-19 has killed more North Carolinians in a year than the flu has in the last 10 years. By the North Carolina health departments count, there have been 5,200 COVID-19 deaths this year and 1,486 flu deaths over the last decade. Cohens claim also tracks with data collected by the CDC, according to an agency spokesman. However, the CDC points out that exact numbers can be tricky to count because there are sometimes delays in processing death information.",1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,True

Final Rating: True  ","Says if current trends continue, by 2040, one out of three Texas workers will not have a high school diploma.","In an opinion piece published in Texas newspapers in August 2012, the chairman of the Texas Association of Business opened his call for funding successful preschool programs by suggesting potential among the states toddlers.Our homes and preschools are filled with aspiring astronauts, firefighters, teachers and computer scientists, Bill Hammond wrote. Unfortunately, if current trends continue, by 2040, one out of three Texas workers will not have a high school diploma. That's not dreaming big, that's a Texas-sized nightmare. It's a formula for broken dreams, dead-end jobs and a strain on the state's economy.Are we on track for one of three adult Texans to lack even a high school diploma? That would be more than double the nearly 15 percent of the states 10.2 million workers aged 25 through 64 who had not graduated from high school as of 2010, according to the U.S. Census Bureaus American Community Survey. Asked for his backup, Hammond pointed us toward Steven Murdock, the former state demographer who directs the Hobby Center for the Study of Texas at Rice University.In a telephone interview, Murdock said Hammond was echoing a projection included in a 2003 book, The New Texas Challenge, written by several authors led by Murdock.Murdock told us the projection, to be updated within the next year, was based on changes in the states racial and ethnic populations and assuming that people would continue to have the same levels of education in 2040 as 2000.Broadly, he said, generally highly-educated baby boomers have started retiring from the workforce and will continue to do so for the next 15 years. He said the baby boomers are being replaced with less-educated workers.Its a simple simulation, he said. What were simply saying is that the share of workers lacking a high school diploma will absolutely be the case if we have the population growth we project and we do not have a change in the educational attainment of our different racial and ethnic groups.The relevant section of the book says that in the absence of change in the educational characteristics of Blacks and Hispanics -- populations that are projected to grow more rapidly than the Anglo population -- the states labor force will be less well educated in the future than in 2000.A chart in the book shows that in 2000, nearly 19 percent of the states labor force lacked a high school diploma while 30.1 percent of the workforce will fit that category as of 2040. The projection, Murdock writes, is predicated on assuming that migration rates by age, sex and race-ethnicity remain what they were from 1990 to 2000.According to the chart, some 29 percent of the workforce will consist of high school graduates, about the same as in 2000, and about 24 percent of the workforce will have completed some college, compared to 29 percent in 2000. Finally, about 13 percent of the workforce will have a bachelors degree compared to 18 percent in 2000 while about 4 percent will have a graduate or professional degree compared to 5 percent in 2000.We asked Murdock if anything could knock his 30 percent projection askew.A lot of things could, he replied, including whether some slowing in Hispanic immigration and/or a drop in Hispanic birth rates in the state prove permanent. Another factor, he said, would be state decisions to step up, or ratchet down, educational spending.Next, we asked an outside demographer, Elwood Carlson, a professor of sociology at Florida State University, if the methodology behind the projection seems solid. Carlson said the approach -- a cohort component survival projection model -- is a standard way of reaching such a forecast.Our rulingHammond said if current trends continue, by 2040, one out of three Texas workers will not have a high school diploma. Murdocks projection is that all factors staying the same, about 30 percent of workers will lack a high school diploma.",1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,True

Final Rating: True  ",Says the state budget includes spending on commercials for Fortune 500 companies.,"State Rep. David Simpson says the state budget lawmakers sent to Gov. Rick Perry spends money in the wrong places — such as on Walmart commercials.Despite conservative boasts of cost cutting, not raising taxes and not using the Economic Stabilization Fund, or rainy day fund, the budget still preserves about $500 million of pork for special interests including film and music makers, video games and commercials for Fortune 500 companies, the Longview Republican said in a June 5 op-ed in the Longview News-Journal.Its well-reported that the state promotes music, film and even video games. But this is the first weve heard about funding TV spots for the top 500 U.S. companies that Fortune magazine ranks by revenue every year.To back up the statement, Simpson aide Michael Bullock noted that the 2012-13 budget the House approved on May 28 appropriates $32 million for film and music marketing, a program overseen by the governors office. The budget provides $16 million each year to market Texas as a film location and promote the Texas music industry, according to the May 26 House-Senate conference committee report.What does that have to do with Fortune 500 TV spots?Bullock pointed us to a March report by the Texas state comptroller analyzing the states economic development incentives for 2010. According to the report, lawmakers in 2007 revised the Film Industry Incentive Program, created in 2005, so its grants could be extended to companies working in the entire moving image industry, sweeping in makers of commercials, TV programs and video games.In 2009, the Legislature appropriated $64 million in incentives for the biennium.According to the report, from April 2009 through August 2010, the Texas Film Commission approved 152 applications to help fund the production of commercials, awarding $2 million to grantees who, all told, said theyd spend $37.4 million in Texas.And did any of the commercials promote Fortune 500 companies? The report lists a handful.As of Aug. 31, the company Action Figure No. 1. Inc., had received more than $8,000 for an AT&T television commercial, which was one of three commercials made for AT&T, a Fortune 500 company, by three different companies using state grants totaling about $25,600, the report says. Also, the company Radical Media received $32,000 in grant money to make a commercial for Walmart, another Fortune 500 company, and the company Modern Times received $11,133 to make a commercial for the TV show Friday Night Lights. That show aired on NBC, a network owned by the Fortune 500 company General Electric.We wondered if each Fortune 500 company benefits from grants going to separate production companies. Perry spokeswoman Lucy Nashed told us the grants can go to either the production company, advertising agency or the client — such as a Fortune 500 company — involved in a supported TV ad. Lastly, we turned to the Texas Film Commission, which says on its website that certain commercials — such as ads for state agencies or those that portray Texas negatively — arent eligible for incentives.Otherwise, state law permits incentives for a TV commercial project of up to 5 percent of the amount spent on the project in the state, according to the commission. To qualify, the maker must spend at least $100,000 in Texas, at least 60 percent of its shooting days must be completed in the state and at least 70 percent of the paid crew, cast and extras must be Texas residents.Nashed told us TV commercial projects will continue to be eligible for incentives in 2012-13.",1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,True

Final Rating: True  ",There are more job openings than there are people on unemployment in Iowa.,"Democrats were quick to criticize Iowas Republican Gov. Kim Reynolds when Reynolds announced on Tuesday, May 11, that the statewill stop takingfederal funds for supplemental $300 payments to Iowans receiving unemployment benefits. The shift away from that COVID-19-related federal aid program, which means an end to the payment to out-of-work Iowans, is to take effect after June 12, 2021. The announcement came one day after an Iowa Workforce Development memorandum that said Iowa has a workforce shortage, which led Rep. Lindsey James (D-Dubuque) tostate on Twitter: There are more job openings than there are people on unemployment. Lets name the real problem here – Iowa needs higher wages. #ialegis More available jobs than people on unemployment to fill them? Yes, that is what theIowa Workforce Development report, from director Beth Townsend to Reynolds, states. Iowa had 60,900 unemployed workers in March for a 3.7 percent unemployment rate, that report stated, relying on U.S. Bureau of Labor Statisticsdata. More than 66,000 job openings showed up on the IowaWORKSwebsiteon May 10, Townsend wrote in the memorandum. Claims, continued and initial, continue to trend down, Townsends memorandum stated. Terminating the federal unemployment programs will not affect individuals eligible for regular state unemployment insurance claim benefits. Republicans, backed by business owners and trade groups,have arguedthat employers are having difficulty attracting workers in Iowa because of the jobless benefits money those prospective workers are receiving.The overwhelming message we receive from employers these days is the lack of workforce that is adversely affecting their ability to recover from the pandemic, Townsend said in a statement released by the governors office. Democrats, like James, counter that employers need to offer higher wages. Iowa had a labor shortage pre-COVID and it has continued now that we are recovering from COVID,James wrote in an email to PolitiFact Iowa.Moreover, she wrote,Iowa has more job openings that arent on the IowaWORKS website. Registered nursing jobs are most in demand in Iowa, the IowaWORKS website shows, but those jobs require special training and are an example of job requirements and pay disparity that exists. Other jobs, such as wait staff that Iowa restaurant owners toldThe Gazettenewspaper in Eastern Iowathey need, dont require the specialized college education a registered nursing job needs. Wait staff starting pay is around$8.45an hour, far less than the$23.84an hour entry pay for registered nurses in Iowa, state wage data show. After hearing about pandemic-related layoffs and job cuts the past year, seeing that more people are seeking jobs in Iowa than are taking unemployment benefits might surprise some. But the numbers back it up and both sides of the argument on what Iowa should do about unemployment benefits do not dispute it. We are confining our rating to the numbers and rate the claim to be True.",1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,True

Final Rating: Mostly True  ",Says 94 percent of (Marco Rubio's) constituents support a universal background check.,"Former astronaut Mark Kelly, the husband of Arizona shooting victim Gabby Giffords, said that while gun control doesnt poll very well, theres incredible momentum to pass a universal background check law. Never mind five Republican senators, including Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., who say that theyre going to filibuster any new Second Amendment restrictions. I would say to Marco Rubio that 94 percent of his constituents support a universal background check, Kelly told Fox News Sunday host Chris Wallace on March 31, 2013. National polls this year show strong support for universal background checks, from Pew Research Centers 85 percent to Quinnipiac Universitys 92 percent. We wondered, is it true that 94 percent of Floridians —who share their state with NRA superlobbyist Marion Hammer and a Stand Your Ground law — favor universal background checks? The polls We reached out to Kelly and Giffords advocacy group, Americans for Responsible Solutions, but didnt immediately hear back. Still, we quickly found a poll supporting Kellys 94 percent figure. It came from a group co-chaired by New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, Mayors Against Illegal Guns. The February survey of 600 voters was conducted by the polling firm of Democratic consultant Doug Schoen. We wouldnt call that an independent survey. However, Quinnipiac University conducted state surveys in March. And its poll of 1,000 registered voters found 91 percent support for universal background checks. The question: Do you favor or oppose requiring background checks for all gun buyers? That also supports Kellys 94 percent claim — within the Quinnipiac polls 3.1 percentage point margin of error. Its also decent evidence that Floridians are in line with the country on expanding background checks from just sales by federally licensed dealers to sales between private sellers, sometimes referred to as closing the gun show loophole or private seller loophole. Even among Florida Republicans, the Quinnipiac poll showed 87 percent support. Rubio hasnt been so clear. In January, he gave an interview that made it sound like he was open to universal checks. (I think you'll find support for that so long as there's not a public database that people can look up and see who owns what guns and where they live.) Then his spokesman clarified he wasnt. (Expanding it to private sales is problematic because you are asking an individual to conduct a background check on another individual. That is expensive and hard to do, and he does not support that.) His most recent statement doesnt endorse background checks and opposes new Second Amendment restrictions. Our ruling Kelly said 94 percent of (Rubio's) constituents support a universal background check. A major state poll conducted in March shows 91 percent of Florida voters favor requiring checks for all gun buyers. Kellys claim is within the polls margin of error.",1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.5,0.5,1.0,1.0,Mostly True

Final Rating: True  ",Twice as many children are inBorder Patrolcustody under Biden than Trump peak in 2019.,"Unaccompanied minors have been arriving at the southern U.S. border in record numberssince President JoeBiden took office,andRepublicanleaders in border stateshave beenquickto highlight the challenges the federal government is facing. Gov. Greg Abbotthas hammered the Biden administration on border issues throughoutMarch.First heaccusedthe administration ofreckless border policiesthathave released migrantswho tested positive for COVID-19into theU.S. And in recent weeks, the governor has focused on the uptick of unaccompanied minors arriving at the border. On March 30,Abbottclaimedin a tweetthat twice as many children are in Border Patrol custody under Biden than Trump peak in 2019. The Biden Admin. is unprepared for the crises they have caused,Abbottcontinued, adding that state police andNationalGuardforces have been dispatched to assistinthe situation. 2019 wasthe last year border authorities recorded a surge in migrant children and familycrossings. And authorities believe that the number of encounters this year will surpass levels seenthen. But is it true that the number of unaccompanied minorsin federal custody today isalready twice thehighestnumberrecordedin 2019 underformer PresidentDonaldTrump? Abbotts claim cited an article published Tuesday by the Washington Examiner, a conservativeWashington,D.C.,newssite.Citing federal data exclusively obtained Monday evening, the website reported the same claim. U.S. Customs and Border Protectionconfirmedthe numbers. Under Trump, the government recordeda peak of 2,600 unaccompanied minorsin federal custody in June 2019.In 2020, the Trump administrationstopped taking minors into custody after it implemented a policy that immediately expelled all people crossing the border, including children, citing COVID-19 precautions. The Biden administration suspended that policy for children in January and now allowschildren who cross the border aloneto remain in theU.S. while they await immigration courtproceedings. U.S. Customs and Border Protectionalso released to PolitiFact a daily memo reporting the number of unaccompanied children in government custody. As ofMarch 29, the number of unaccompanied children in custody was 5,160,whichisnearly twice the number recorded in June 2019. The memo also reported that an average of 492 unaccompanied children were being placed in federal custody each dayinMarch, whilean averageof399were being transferred out of custody daily. With facility intake consistently outpacing output,obviously, those numbers are going to stack up, a seniorU.S. Customs and Border Protectionofficial told reporters during aMarch 26briefing. Migrant childrencanbeheld atBorderPatrol facilitiesfor a maximumof72hours, a rule set forth under theTrafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of 2008.From there, children are referred to the Office of Refugee Resettlement, within U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, which is tasked with providing care for the minors and connecting them with suitable sponsors. But the strain the high number of migrant children has placed on the system has caused many minors to be held up at theBorderPatrol facilitiesbeyond the 72-hour limit.(The Trump administration also struggled with meeting thatlimit.)As of March 30, for instance,more than2,000 children being held at a Border Patrol facility in Donna had been there for more than 72 hours, according toPro Publica. We need to do a better job of ensuring that HHS and ORR has greater capacity, and we need to speed up the transfer of these children from our custody to their custody much faster, theBorder Patrolofficial said. The Biden administration has raced to establishgreater capacity in the Office of RefugeeResettlementto relieve the bottleneck withinBorder Patrolfacilities.The agency has activated or opened what it calls influxcare facilities, which areunlicensed care facilities that offer surplus shelter space and can be set up in a matter of weeks, and emergency intake sites, which are new facilities that serve as waystations forunaccompaniedchildren moving fromBorderPatrolcustody to Office of Refugee Resettlement custody, according to the U.S. Committee for Refugees and Immigrants. Many of these new or temporary shelters have been opened across Texas. Influx care facilities now operate inCarrizoSprings and Pecos; emergencyintake sites have been openedin a Dallas convention centeranda former oil workers' camp in Midland. Its difficult to pinpoint the precise factors that are causing todaysnumbersof unaccompanied children to double2019s peak, experts say. Immigration experts often separatemigration driversintotwo categories:push factors,or theconditions in origin countries that are causing people toleave home;and pull factors,orthe conditionsof a destination country that make it a more attractive place to live. Immigration policies in the U.S. are often listed as a significant pull factor, and Bidenrelaxing those policies following Trumps immigration austerityis often cited as a significantone. But many experts say thatitsthepush factorsinmigrants home countries that are strong drivers of migrationinto the U.S.In2019, Honduras struggled with civil unrest and an increase in gang violence, while Guatemalans wrestledwith environmental issues that impacted the populations food security. This year, Honduras, Guatemala andNicaragua suffered two category-4 hurricanes that struck the region within a two-week span.Withmillions left in need of aid, the hurricanes exacerbated poverty and worsened access to clean water, giving an extra nudge to people considering northern migration. The hurricanes made a huge difference, saidYael Schacher, senior U.S. advocate at Refugees International. People were in a situation where they were just getting by, and then the hurricane wiped them out. Abbott said in a tweet that twice as many unaccompanied children are inBorder Patrolcustodypresently than during the peak number seen in 2019 under Trump. Numbers from U.S. Customs and Border Protection verify this claim.The Trump administration recorded 2,600 minors inBorder Patrolcustody in June 2019, which was the highest amount seen during Trumps term. As of March 29,5,160 minors were inBorder Patrolcustody waiting to be transferred to the Office of Refugee Resettlement, which is 40 minors short of double 2,600.",1.0,0.0,1.0,0.9,0.0,0.0,0.1,1.0,1.0,True

Final Rating: True  ",The potential Iran nuclear agreement would limit Iran to the number of centrifuges needed for a weapon but too few for a nuclear power program.,"The deadline for an agreement on Irans nuclear program is something of a moving target,but right nownegotiators need to wrap things up by June 2015. The five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council — China, France, Russia, the United Kingdom and the United States — along with Germany, have until then to strike a deal with the Islamic republic. If all goes the way the United States hopes, a signed agreement will keep Iran out of the nuclear weapons club. For now, the two sides are operating under an interim agreement, which rolls back Irans stock of enriched uranium and freezes the countrys capability to produce nuclear materials that could be used to make a nuclear bomb. In exchange, Iran can sell its oil more freely and gain access to millions of dollars in frozen assets. One element thats fully expected in a long-term arrangement is a limit on the number and kinds of centrifuges Iran can use to enrich uranium. Former CIA deputy director Michael Morell said theres an irony in that. If you are going to have a nuclear weapons program, 5,000 is pretty much the number you need, Morell, now a CBS analyst, said on Charlie Rose. If you have a power program, you need a lot more. By limiting them to a small number of centrifuges, we are limiting them to the number you need for a weapon. Morell told PunditFact he said 5,000 because that was lowest number he had heard was in play. The number of centrifuges in place today is a hair over 20,000, and a likely goal is to cut that to about 5,000. But Morells basic point struck us as just plain intriguing. We wanted to learn more about this idea that a nuclear power program would require many more centrifuges than youd need for a bomb -- which by extension means that limiting centrifuge capacity is just onenegotiating point out of many. The consensus among the experts we reached is that Morell is on the money. Matthew Kroenig at Georgetown University told PunditFact the Morell is is absolutely correct. Ditto for Daryl Kimball of the Arms Control Association and David Albright of the Institute for Science and International Security. Matthew Bunn at Harvard agreed with his colleagues.  People think surely you must need a bigger enrichment system to make 90 percent enriched material for bombs than to make 4-5 percent enriched material for power reactors, Bunn said. But exactly the opposite is true. Bunn said there are two reasons. First, you need tens of tons of material to fuel a power reactor for a year, but just tens of kilograms to make a bomb. According to the International Atomic Energy Agency, the threshold amount for a bomb is about 25 kilograms of the most highly enriched U-235. And while yes, its harder to make 90 percent enriched uranium (bomb) than 4-5 percent enriched uranium (power), its not that much harder, Bunn said. The toughest part in the process comes when you start with the raw uranium. By the time youve brought that to 4-5 percent, youve already done more than 2/3 of the work of going all the way to 90 percent U-235 for weapons, Bunn said. So the amount of work needed to make bomb material is only a modest amount more per kilogram, and the number of kilograms you need for bombs is 1,000 times less. Bottom line: Making bombs takes fewer centrifuges. And without a lot of centrifuges, its hard to make nuclear power. For the record, some centrifuge modelsare better than others, so that's also a factor. Today, Iran has just one nuclear power station, the plant at Bushehr that it bought from the Russians. To keep that facility running, Iran would need to increase its centrifuge capacity ten-fold. A steady supply of fuel from Russia is what keeps Bushehr online. Centrifuges and a nuclear deal This fact that bombs require fewer centrifuges than power is a source of frustration for Albright, a physicist with the Institute for Science and International Security. I wish it were reversed, he told us. Then we could easily tell if the program was for weapons. As the clock clicks down to reach an agreement, the number of centrifuges and their level of sophistication will draw a lot of scrutiny. Kimball, of the Arms Control Association, said the specific terms on this front will have to resolve a crucial question: What are Irans practical needs, and how do you square that with international concern about the real purpose? Ideally, Kimball said, Russia or another nation would continue to supply the fuel, but barring that, the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council and Germany aim to put on cap on the number of centrifuges for as many years as possible. Allowing about 5,000 would help. With that, it would take 12 months for Iran to produce enough material for one bomb, Kimball said. That would give you enough time to detect that activity. But Bunn underscored that an agreement would have many moving parts and a key element would be the number of years that Iran agreed to rein in its centrifuge capacity. Because the sides have already agreed in the (interim agreement) that after the agreement expires, Iran is to be treated like other parties to the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. That would mean it could build up its enrichment capacity to have enough to fuel Bushehr or even more reactors, Bunn said. The variables dont stop there. If Iran ramped up production of fuel for nuclear power, it would need a ready supply of raw ore, which it might need to purchase on the international market. During his interview with Charlie Rose, Morell warned that the focus on declared centrifuges is misplaced, because he expects that if Iran were to try to build a bomb, it would do so in secret. The only protection against that, Morell said, is unannounced inspections at any place in the country at any time. Our ruling Morell said that it takes fewer centrifuges to make bomb-grade nuclear material than it does to supply fuel for a nuclear power plant and argued that the focus on centrifuges can go too far. That argument aside, experts agreed that Morrell has his facts right. A power plant requires tons of fuel each year. A bomb requires about 25 kilograms of U-235 enriched to the 90 percent level. If an agreement limits Iran to about 9,000 centrifuges, that would be sufficient to produce enough bomb-grade material but would leave Iran well short of the capacity to generate fuel to power nuclear power plants.",1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,True

Final Rating: True  ","Under Mayor Tom Barrett, the number of Milwaukee police officers has not increased.","Milwaukee Ald. Bob Donovan, a candidate for mayor in 2016, worries that upcoming retirements could further reduce what he sees as an undersized police force under Mayor Tom Barrett. In his state of the city speech Feb. 24, 2014, Barrett noted he had added 120 new officers in his 2014 budget. Donovan hit on that number when interviewed in the wake of his mayoral announcement. The reality is the number of officers has not increased, Donovan said during a July 29, 2014 appearance on the Charlie Sykes show on WTMJ-AM. Now the mayor will continue to say were hiring 120 cops this year. That doesnt take into consideration the fact that weve had 150 retirements, or that we havent filled positions going way back. When we asked Donovan about the comment, he did not cite hard numbers, but told us he figures unfilled positions and retirements have outstripped the addition of recruits over the 10 years Barrett has been in office. Is Donovan right? Has police strength -- at least by the numbers -- been flat or gone down on Barretts watch? To answer that question, we turned to the citys Fire and Police Commission, which issues an annual report that details the size of the overall force. To be sure, the actual number of bodies on the force on any given date is constantly changing, since retirement dates vary while recruit classes mean a wave of new bodies joins the force at once. The Fire and Police Commission reports, available online, are as close to an official tally of police strength as we found. They list, by race and gender, the number of persons on the Police Department payroll as of the last pay period of each year. The latest covers 2012, so we obtained figures for 2013 and so far in 2014 directly from the commission. We used 2004 as the pre-Barrett baseline for our comparisons, because Barrett didnt take office until spring 2004 and therefore did not propose the budget for that year. All figures factor in retirements, terminations and new hires. Police officers At the end of 2004, 1,402 police officers were on the payroll. That number fell to 1,357 by the end of 2013, a 3 percent drop. By that measure -- the one the public sees -- Donovan is correct that officer strength has not increased. Barrett administration officials note it can be misleading to look only at strength of force at any one point in time. A new class of officer recruits came on line in late 2004, boosting the number, they said. A comparison of pay period one in 2004 to the same period in 2014, for example, actually shows a small increase in officer strength. A better measure than point in time comparisons, they said, is average strength across the whole year. That was 1,349 in 2004, they said, and based on the first half of 2014 its 1,341 now -- a smaller decline. Still, that approach does not change the accuracy of Donovans claim. Total sworn officers City officials often will refer to this larger figure when discussing officer strength, and Donovan did as well when we contacted him. It includes not only patrol officers but detectives, supervisors, various technicians and specialists as well as the police chief and the top command staff. At the end of 2004, the figures show 2,006 sworn officers were on board. That number fell to 1,828 by late 2013 and to 1,875 by mid-July 2014. Earlier in 2004, according to Barretts budget staff, the figure was 1,932. And Barretts office released figures using the average strength throughout the year that show a smaller drop in overall sworn strength. Again, those figures change the angle of descent, but not the downward direction of the trend. Within those numbers, the detective ranks fell by more than one fourth. So by this broader measure, Donovan is on target again. Ten-year trend The staff strength figures from the Fire and Police Commission show that the police officer ranks grew early in Barretts tenure, but have slipped gradually with one exception since then.  Year 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 P.O.s* 1,402 1,362 1,390 1,441 1,406 1,392 1,362 1,348 1,384 1,357 1,345** As for the broader sworn ranks, a similar trend is evident. By way of explaining the lack of growth in the police force, Barrett chief of staff Patrick Curley and city budget officials said state shared-revenue aid to Milwaukee has dropped by $25 million since 2004 while the police budget is $65 million higher. They said the department under Chief Edward Flynn has re-deployed officers from administrative tasks to community policing. That was accomplished by hiring more civilians to do those desk jobs, they said. Efficiencies have helped avoid layoffs seen in some big cities, Barrett spokeswoman Jodie Tabak said. The Barrett officials told PolitiFact Wisconsin that our inquiry for this fact check led the mayor to quickly unveil a proposal to add 15 more officers to a training class that will graduate in April 2015. It already had been under consideration to announce later this year, they said. The mayor will propose his 2015 budget in September. Our rating Donovan said the number of Milwaukee police officers has not increased under Mayor Tom Barrett. Donovans claim is on target because reports from the citys Fire and Police Commission indicate a decline in the number of officers since 2004. And other measuring sticks offered by Barretts office show the same trend.",1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,True

Final Rating: Half True  ",The state budget proposal has been submitted on time and [it's] the earliest that a governor has done so in over two decades.,"Just 16 days into the new year, Rhode Island Gov. Lincoln Chafee went before the General Assembly to offer his third State of the State address and talk about his proposed $8.2-billion 2013-2014 budget.Earlier in the day he released details of his budget package to the media and by the next day, his complete budget had been posted online.During his Jan. 16 speech to members of the House and Senate, Chafee declared, I submit this budget to the General Assembly on Jan. 16th – on time and the earliest that a governor has done so in over two decades.State law requires governors to submit their budgets to the legislature by the third Thursday in January (or the first Thursday in February if it's their first year in office). Chafee beat that deadline by one day.Submitting a budget early sounds like a good thing. At a briefing for reporters, Chafees director of administration, Richard Licht, said the early submittal reflected the discipline the governor has tried to bring to the whole budget process. And it will give the General Assembly more time to analyze it properly.We wondered whether Chafee's claim that his budget is the earliest to be submitted in more than two decades was true.We called his office to ask for their evidence.Meanwhile, we turned to the always-helpful Thomas Evans, the state librarian.Evans doesn't keep track of when a governor's budget is released, but he had data for when governors gave their State of the State/budget addresses and when their proposed budgets were submitted as legislation.It turns out, there can be a big gap between the two. For example, in 1989, the second year on Evans' list, Gov. Edward DiPrete addressed the General Assembly on Jan. 4, yet his budget bill wasn't introduced until March 1.In the previous 25 years, no governor has submitted a budget bill by the original deadline set by state law, according to Evans' data. (Extensions were written into the law for budgets submitted from 2005-2007 and for 2011 and 2012). Usually submission comes sometime in February. In eight years it was in March and in one year -- 1991 when Gov. Bruce Sundlun was dealing with the banking crisis -- it came April 9.We confirmed Evans dates using The Journal's archives and found that details of the budget are usually released a day or two before the budget bill is introduced.The earliest the budget bill itself has been submitted in the last 25 years is Feb. 1, said Evans. That was in 2005 and 2007 (during the administration of Gov. Donald Carcieri) and 2012 (Chafee's second year).Chafee's budget bill is on his website and Chafee spokeswoman Christine Hunsinger said it has been sent to the House.However, it has not been officially introduced and referred to a committee for analysis.Said Hunsinger: We hope they will introduce it Tuesday,That would be Jan. 22, still ten days earlier than the previous record.(If you have a claim youd like PolitiFact Rhode Island to check, e-mail us at [emailprotected].

Final Rating: Mostly True  ",Says Oregon is near the top or at the top of the list when it comes to capital gains tax,"Capital gains taxes have quickly become a hot topic at the state Capitol. Of course, theres been a buzz surrounding them ever since the gubernatorial campaign in 2010 when now-Gov. John Kitzhaber and his Republican opponent sparred over just how much to adjust the states rate.Now, the jockeying has been left to lawmakers who have crafted at least three bills amending the tax to various degrees. At a recent hearing on the bills, Rep. Tobias Read, who favors something of a moderate approach, noted that having a capital gains tax that can, at the highest bracket, reach 11 percent is a barrier for some.Having a rate that puts us near the top or at the top of the list makes it more difficult for us as a state to get to the rest of the discussion about the other great things that are in Oregon, he said.This is something wed heard before -- that Oregons rate was one of, if not the, highest in the nation. But when he said it, it occurred to us, wed never actually checked to see if that were the case. So we set off to correct that oversight.To start, we contacted Chris Allanach, a senior economist with the House Revenue Committee (the committee where Tobias made his remarks). Allanach said that to the best of his knowledge, Read was onto something -- not only is it among the highest rates, he said, but as far as I can tell, it is (the highest).(He did caution that this was set to change pretty soon here. When voters approved Measures 66 and 67, they voted to decrease the top income tax rate from 11 percent to 9.9 percent. That means, as of Jan. 1, 2012, the maximum capital gains tax rate will also be 9.9 percent.)Allanach cited his source as the Federation of Tax Administrators. We went to that site and looked up a comparative table of state income tax brackets. Indeed, it showed that as of Jan. 1, 2011, Oregon was tied with Hawaii for the highest rate at the upper bracket -- 11 percent.Generally speaking, a states capital gains tax rate is only as high as its highest income tax rate. In fact, states often keep it lower than that as an incentive of sorts, Allanach said. That seemed reasonable, but we wanted to make sure that there wasnt a state out there that might have an unconventional tax rate.So, we dialed up Ronald Alt, senior research associate with the Federation of Tax Administrators, and asked if he knew of any states that went higher with their capital gains than they do with their income tax. It turns out one does: Massachusetts.Massachusetts makes a distinction between short term (those held for less than a year) and long term corporate gains. For the former, the state charges a rate of 12 percent.Where does all that leave us?Well, Read was right -- were among the highest in the nation. If you dont count Massachusetts system, we tie for the No. 1 spot. Even when 2012 rolls around and the rate drops to 9.9 percent, Oregon will still rank as one of the highest -- second only to Hawaii (and, in some cases, Massachusetts).

Final Rating: True",My Treasury team eliminated a 900-case backlog in the Crime Victim Compensation Program.,"As a candidate for governor, state General Treasurer Gina Raimondo has been touting her experience in the venture capital business as an asset when it comes to running the treasurers office, and possibly the rest of state government. On her campaign website, under the headline Making Government Work, she says she implemented a strategy to streamline management in her office. As evidence, she claims that under her tenure, the treasurers office cleared a 900-claim backlog in the state Crime Victim Compensation Program that had been building up for years. She makes a similar claim on the treasurers website. We decided to check her claim on those claims. The Crime Victim Compensation Program pays grants to Rhode Island crime victims or their family members. Awards can be used to help pay for expenses such as health insurance deductibles, medical care, lost wages, mental health therapy, crime scene cleanup or funeral costs. Individual victims often file more than one claim, but the maximum amount any one person can receive is $25,000. Most of the programs money comes from fines and assessments levied in the state courts, augmented by federal funds.  When we asked Raimondos office for backup, her staff provided a breakdown of the unresolved claim backlog that they said they found after sorting through the compensation programs files when she took office in 2011. It comprised 912 claims by 415 people. The names of the individuals and the doctors or health care providers who were paid were redacted from the documents we received. Treasurers office spokeswoman Joy Fox said fund staffers began going through the paperwork in the files around the middle of 2011, finishing around November. During that time they found instances in which claims had been filed but not decided, and others in which claims had been approved but not paid. The accounting listed the date that each backlogged claim was filed, how much was sought, when it was approved or denied, how much was awarded if it had been approved, when the check was issued and the check number. The earliest claim went back to 2007. After the list was compiled, Fox said the effort to resolve them began in January 2012. According to the payment accounting from Raimondos office, by June of 2012 about 95 percent of the claims had resolved. The remainder, 47 claims, were finished by December 2012. Since then, the average wait time for a new claim to be resolved is 28.9 days, the treasurers office said in its 2013 annual report on the program to the General Assembly. Of the 912 claims, 391 were approved for some kind of award, about 43 percent. The total amount paid out on those came to $681,890.67. We wanted to find independent verification of that figure.  So we went to the treasurers office online transparency portal, which lists the checks issued by the state in given fiscal years. We looked for the 391 checks on the backlog list and found 310 matches -- enough to give us confidence in Raimondos figure. Fox said the rest dont show individually on the transparency portal because the state consolidates multiple payments to single health care service providers into a single combined number for each payee. Our ruling Gina Raimondo said her office was able to resolve 900 pending claims from the states Crime Victim Compensation Program since she became general treasurer in 2011. Her staff provided an accounting that outlined the effort. It showed 912 claims resolved, 12 more than she said. We independently verified enough of the claims to rule her statement True.

Final Rating: True  ","The status quo led the General Assembly to reduce pension payments four straight years starting in 2005, costing billions of dollars as the delay in contributions essentially borrowed from pension funds at a very high interest rate.","Illinois Gov. Bruce Rauner has been pushing for changes to the states pension funds since he first began running for governor in 2013. His proposed FY 2016 budget suggested moving all state employees into a pension plan with lower benefits. He moved away from that approach once the Illinois Supreme Court declared unconstitutional a law that sought changes to pension benefits. He hasnt, however, stopped blaming the Illinois General Assembly, with its Democratic majorities, for contributing to the states mushrooming pension debt. As he launched an extended media crusade this year, Rauner said legislators who approved pension contribution breaks from 2005 to 2009 cost state workers and taxpayers billions. The status quo led the General Assembly to reduce pension payments four straight years starting in 2005, Rauner wrote in Springfields Capitol newspaper, costing billions of dollars as the delay in contributions essentially borrowed from pension funds at a very high interest rate. For several years now, Illinois has had the dubious distinction of having the worst pension debt in the nation. Illinois current debt was listed at $129.8 billion in November by the state General Assemblys bipartisan Commission on Government Forecasting and Accountability.  We decided to dig in to Rauners claim that reducing payments cost billions and was like borrowing at high interest rate. Borrowed time A 2013 settlement Illinois officials made with the federal Securities and Exchange Commission confirms the reduced pension payments for the four years in question, said Laurie Cohen, senior analyst with the Institute for Illinois Fiscal Sustainability at the Civic Federation, a nonpartisan government finance research group. The SEC said that despite state claims that pension holidays would be offset by increased fund contributions from 2008 to 2010, a 2005 amendment allowed lawmakers to skip increasing contributions to make up for the pension contribution holidays. The SEC settlement document underscores Rauners claim that the delay in contributions exacerbated the state pension funds condition. Although the State disclosed the basic fact of these reduced contributions, it reads, the State did not disclose that each of these deviations exacerbated the Structural Underfunding, deferred contributions further into the future, impaired the ability of the State to meet its pension obligations, and negatively impacted the States creditworthiness. Daniel Hertz, a senior policy analyst with the progressive Center for Tax and Budget Accountability, agreed Rauners claim was supported by the facts. In an email, Hertz said, The legislation Rauner referenced did have the effect of reducing pension contributions below what they otherwise would have been for four years, and that additional underfunding was, essentially, borrowing that increased costs down the line. According to a 2006 COGFA report, Hertz said, the net effect of the law was to increase pension payments from the State by $6.8 billion between FY2006 and FY2045. Our ruling In an opinion piece published by a Springfield newspaper, Republican Gov. Bruce Rauner said lawmakers in the Illinois General Assembly authorized reduced pension payments from 2005-2009. He said those lowered contributions cost billions and were akin to borrowing from the funds at a high interest rate. The General Assemblys own finance agency and a federal settlement with the SEC confirms four years of reduced contributions. The SEC said the move aggravated the funds condition and ability to meet its obligations and worsened its creditworthiness. A 2006 report said the underfunding required $6.8 billion more in payments.",1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,True

Final Rating: Mostly True  ","Last week's three most-viewed television programs wereSunday Night Football, Thursday Night Football and Monday Night Football.","Not even the Ray Rice scandal could yank professional football games from the top of television viewership rankings, said conservative commentator George Will. Will participated in a Fox News Sunday political panel dissecting the NFLs response to the video showing Rice, a former Baltimore Ravens running back, assaulting his now-wife in an elevator. NFL Commissioner Roger Goodells performance has been widely criticized, but Will predicted he will survive the scandal. Why? Americas real pastime is an economic behemoth that cant be stopped. Last weeks three most-viewed television programs were Sunday Night Football, Thursday Night Football and Monday Night Football, he said. And money talks and it will continue to talk. And this will pass over, and football will go on its merry way. Its no secret that professional football has a big TV audience. We wanted to know just how big. By the numbers To check Wills claim we looked to a top-10 ranking of shows by the Nielsen Company, which tracks consumer trends, including television viewership, from the week of Monday, Sept. 8, through Sunday, Sept. 14. It is the most-recent week available. That Monday, TMZ released a video showing Rice punching his now-wife in an elevator. On the same day, the Baltimore Ravens terminated their contract with Rice, and Goodell announced that Rice was on indefinite suspension. Later in the week, the Associated Press reported that NFL executives were supposedly aware of this video months earlier. Nielsen has separate top-10 lists for broadcast television and cable television. Because Monday Night Football appears on ESPN, we decided to combine the lists into one overall ranking. Here are the top 10 shows and their viewership (in millions) that week: 1. NBC Sunday Night Football (22.1) 2. CBS Thursday Night Football (20.8) 3. NBC Sunday Night NFL Pre-Kick show (16.7) 4. CBS NFL Thursday Night Pre-Kick show (13.9) 5. ESPN Monday Night Football - New York/Detroit (13.7) 6. CBS60 Minutes (12.3) 7. NBC Football Night in America (12.4) 8. ESPN Monday Night Football - San Diego/Arizona (11.5) 9. CBS NFL Thursday Night Kickoff (10.6) 10. CBS Americas Got Talent (10.5) As you can see, theres a lot of love for professional football. Americans dont just love the games -- they love the pregame shows, too. The popularity of the pregame shows on NBC and CBS pushed the Monday Night Football game between the New York Giants and Detroit Lions to No. 5. So Wills comment, by Nielsens metrics, is a tad off. Still, the point holds: Pro football games and pre- and post-game analysis dominated 8 out of 10 of the top 10 shows. Only CBS Americas Got Talent and 60 Minutes cracked the list. Of course, excitement for NFL games is high since the season started just a couple weeks ago, and the networks fall television programming hasnt fully kicked in just yet. Even so, NFL games and analysis will continue to dominate the rankings as the season goes on, said Marc Berman, editor-in-chief of TV Media Insights, in an interview with PunditFact. When new shows begin to air, the number of households using television goes up, but they dont take viewers away from football, Berman said. The popularity of the teams playing and whether the game is exciting have a bigger effect on football viewership ratings. Numerous Nielsen statistics show professional footballs seemingly permanent first-place spot. In the 2013-14 season, NBCs Sunday Night Football was the most-watched primetime show, with 21.7 million average viewers. ESPNs Monday Night Football was the No. 1 most-viewed cable television show in 2013. The NFL holds 34 of the 35 most-watched individual shows in the fall of 2013. (The odd one out was NBCs Macys Thanksgiving Parade at No. 22.) And in four of the past five years, the Super Bowl has broken the record for the most-watched television event in history. Professional football stands out from other sports, said Dan Lebowitz, executive director of Northeastern Universitys Center for the Study of Sports and Society. In football, there are only 16 games in a typical season -- as opposed to baseballs 162 games and basketballs 82 games -- so each game becomes a major event. The rise of fantasy football has further solidified the sports popularity, Lebowitz said. The scandals involving Rice and other NFL standoutscant make even a small dent in this trend because of footballs widespread popularity and importance in American culture, Berman said. Football will outlive all of us, he said. Our ruling Will said, Last weeks three most-viewed television programs were Sunday Night Football, Thursday Night Football and Monday Night Football. Football games and related programming accounted for eight of the top 10 most-viewed TV programs between Sept. 8-14, 2014. Even though Monday Night Football came in fifth, not third, Will was right to say that football dominated the rankings. Experts say it will continue to do just that.",0.8,0.1,1.0,0.8,0.0,0.0,0.2,1.0,0.9,Mostly True

Final Rating: Mostly True  ",Todays marijuana is 300 percent to 800 percent more potent than the pot of yesteryear.,"Editors note: This item was revised on April 1, 2014 to reflect the fact that increases of 300 and 800 percent represent four- and nine-fold increases respectively. The ruling remains the same. In the debate over whether marijuana should be legalized, one issue is the question of potency. Critics of legalization argue that the street drug now available for sale is not the marijuana that a lot of baby boomers and Generation Xers have used. One of them, Heidi Heilman, director of New England field development for Smart Approaches to Marijuana and president of the Massachusetts Prevention Alliance, raised the issue March 13 in a commentary in The Providence Journal. Todays marijuana is 300 percent to 800 percent more potent than the pot of yesteryear, she wrote. Such dangerous levels of THC heighten mental illness and addiction risks for those who smoke marijuana — especially for kids with developing brains. THC or tetrahydrocannabinol, available by prescription, is the key active ingredient in marijuana. It's well established that the potency of marijuana has increased over time. On Jan. 24, PolitiFact national ruled that when former Rhode Island Congressman Patrick Kennedy said that marijuana today is genetically modified, with THC levels that far surpass the marijuana of the 1970s, his statement was Mostly True. Heilman was being more specific. Because something 100 percent more potent is actually twice as potent, she was saying that the potency of today's marijuana is now four to nine times greater than yesteryear, a rather vague starting point. Nonetheless, we wanted to see if her statement was on target or her statistic was a bit high. Heilman was quick to send us several pieces of information. The first was a graph showing a rapid increase in potency from 1960 to 2011, a 52-year span. It shows the ratio of THC in marijuana going from 0.2 percent to 11.4 percent. That's an increase of 5,700 percent, well outside the range cited by Heilman. But are those numbers reliable? The graph says the information came from a study in the Journal of Forensic Science. But that study was published in 2010, and only covered a 16-year period that ends in 2008. Its authors, researchers at the National Center for Natural Products Research at the University of Mississippi, examined 46,000 samples of marijuana seized during law enforcement raids. They found that the THC concentrations of marijuana had risen by about 171 percent in that time period, well below the 300 to 800 percent increase cited by Heilman. We also contacted the Drug Enforcement Administration in Boston and Washington and the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy. They referred us back to the research center at Ole Miss, which has been monitoring THC content at least since the early 1970s. The researchers there sent us copies of their reports, all published in the journal, along with test results that included the most recent data. We also secured some of their quarterly reports. We found that even though the report Heilman cited didnt back up her claim, the Ole Miss data did. YEAR Tested % THC YEAR Tested % THC YEAR Tested % THC 1972 34 0.18 1986 1370 2.36 2000 3148 4.92 1973 33 0.22 1987 1550 2.96 2001 2716 5.36 1974 114 0.36 1988 1640 3.18 2002 2413 6.4 1975 149 0.48 1989 1075 3.04 2003 2517 6.31 1976 209 0.98 1990 1108 3.24 2004 2637 7.24 1977 251 1.76 1991 2148 3.09 2005 3004 7.24 1978 130 1.73 1992 3336 3.08 2006 2891 7.76 1979 220 1.53 1993 3031 3.38 2007 3114 8.74 1980 151 2.15 1994 3024 3.50 2008 2775 8.89 1981 249 2.11 1995 4792 3.77 2009 3079 8.34 1982 435 3.07 1996 2451 4.09 2010 2720 10.7 1983 1145 3.30 1997 2496 4.64 2011 2342 11.13 1984 1030 3.31 1998 2283 4.47 2012 2055 12.3 1985 1449 2.83 1999 2692 4.6     In 2012, the most recent year in which testing has been completed, the average THC concentration was 12.3 percent. That would be 300 percent higher (or four times stronger) than 1992 levels, when the average was 3.08 percent. And it would be 800 percent higher (or nine times stronger) than the average level of 0.98 percent found in 1976. How high could the THC content potentially go? One specimen, seized on Sept. 11, 2007, was found to have a THC content of 37.2 percent. Our ruling  Heidi Heilman said, Todays marijuana is 300 percent to 800 percent more potent than the pot of yesteryear. Long-term testing shows that, on average, today's marijuana is three times more potent than pre-1993 marijuana and eight times more potent than grass seized in 1976 and earlier.

Final Rating: True  ","Again today (Ahmadinejad) made light of 9/11, and said that he's not even sure it happened and that people actually died.","Discussing global threats and whether it's wise to directly engage Iran in talks on matters such as its nuclear program, Sen. Hillary Clinton during the April 16 Democratic debate ruled out meeting with Iran's President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. As she criticized the Bush administration for failing to deter Iran from pursuing its nuclear program, Clinton said Ahmadinejad's most recent inflammatory remarks would make it impossible for her to speak with him directly. I certainly would not meet with Ahmadinejad because even again today he made light of 9/11, and said that he's not even sure it happened and that people actually died, Clinton said. Ahmadinejad, who has a history of provocative statements on such things, including saying the Holocaust was a fake, did indeed, question the U.S. version of the events of 9/11 on three occasions in just over a week. He said U.S. claims about being attacked were a pretext for military action against Iraq and Afghanistan. Four or five years ago a suspect event took place in New York, Ahmadinejad said in an April 16 speech in the holy city of Qom that was broadcast live on state television, according to Agence France Presse. A building collapsed and they said that 3,000 people had been killed, whose names were never published. Under this pretext they (the United States) attacked Afghanistan and Iraq and since then a million people have been killed. Ahmadinejad first expressed his doubts about the attacks on April 8 at a ceremony in the holy city of Qom celebrating Iran's nuclear program, which U.S. officials worry could be used to make weapons. He questioned how aircraft could have evaded radar and intelligence and crashed into the twin towers undetected. Ahmadinejad repeated his doubts the next day at a speech at a Shiite holy shrine in the city of Mashhad, according to press accounts. Iran condemned the attacks soon after they occurred. The government at the time was headed by moderate President Mohammad Khatami. Ahmadeinejad has been given to bellicose pronouncement in the past and provoked a global outcry when he described the Holocaust as a myth. During his controversial visit to the United States in September 2007, Ahmadinejad, when asked about the death penalty Iran imposed on homosexuals, denied there were homosexuals in Iran. He has repeatedly called for Israel's destruction. On Wednesday, he reaffirmed his intention to change the international order, Agence France Presse reported. We have two missions, Ahmadinejad proclaimed. To construct Iran and change the global situation. It is impossible to reach the summits of progress without changing the corrupt and unjust order of the world. Tehran insists its nuclear program is peaceful and intended to expand energy supplies for a growing population. The statement may be startling, but it's true. Clinton accurately summarized Ahmadeinejad's recent comments about 9/11. We judge her statement to be True. ",1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,True

Final Rating: True  ",Says Mitt Romney suggested that employers should be able to make the decision as to whether or not a woman gets contraception through her insurance coverage.,"President Barack Obama and Republican candidate Mitt Romney clashed over contraceptives coverage in their second debate, with Romney ultimately declaring, the president's statement of my policy is completely and totally wrong.That sounded like a request for some fact-checking.So, was Obama totally wrong?The issue emerged in the Oct. 16, 2012, debate at Hofstra University after a question from the audience about how the candidates intended to fix income inequality for women.Obama touted signing the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, then said: Romney later responded: It's worth noting that they were talking past each other. Obama was referring to whether an employer should dictate whether employees insurance covers contraceptives. Romney sidestepped the issue about insurance coverage and said he opposes a different concept — whether employers can tell someone whether they can have contraceptive care.For this fact-check, were asking whether Romney has suggested that employers should be able to make the decision as to whether or not a woman gets contraception through her insurance coverage.The Blunt amendmentObamas support for his claim centers on something called the Blunt amendment.Early this year, congressional Republicans made a big push to roll back a provision by Health and Human Services under Obamas health care law that requires most employers to provide birth control coverage without any out-of-pocket costs, with a limited exception for certain religious institutions.In the Senate, Sen. Roy Blunt, R-Mo., sponsored an amendment that would exempt employers from providing any service that went against their beliefs or moral convictions. At the time, the issue put the Obama administration on the defensive and the president himself appeared at the White House briefing room to explain a work-around for religious affiliated hospitals, universities and the like.A few weeks later, with a vote on the Blunt amendment pending, Romney was asked where he stood. He told a Boston radio interviewer Of course I support the Blunt amendment.CNSnews.com, a conservative news service, put the question directly to the Romney campaign.Will Mitt Romney, on day one, rescind this mandate in its entirety — as the Catholic Church has urged the current administration to do — so that individuals, employers and insurers who have a moral or religious objection to contraception or sterilization will not be forced to violate the tenets of their own faith or act against their consciences?Romney campaign spokesman Ryan Williams responded: Yes. Gov. Romney would rescind the mandate in its entirety.In April, Romney reiterated his opposition to the rule at a meeting of the National Rifle Association. He said, As president, I will abolish it.So the Obama campaign argues if Romney supports an employers ability to decline to provide a service that goes against beliefs or moral convictions, that means he supports employers making the decision as to whether or not a woman gets contraception through her insurance coverage.Romneys responseWe asked the Romney campaign to explain his objection to Obamas claim. Here's a statement from spokeswoman Andrea Saul: The statement acknowledges that Romney opposes a nationwide mandate for contraception coverage. In the absence of a federal mandate, that would sometimes leave the decision to employers whether to offer coverage for birth control.(Before Obamacare, some 27 states already required such coverage, though were not sure how many had religious exceptions.)Our rulingObama said Romney suggested that employers should be able to make the decision as to whether or not a woman gets contraception through her insurance coverage.Romney says he doesnt believe bureaucrats or employers should make the call whether a woman can use contraceptives. But his support for the Blunt amendment endorses the approach that employers should be able to make the decision about whether contraception is covered by employees insurance.",1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,True

Final Rating: True  ",The National Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year 2019 includes the largest pay raise in nearly 10 years.,"Part of being a politician requires helpingdecide how much money to set aside to sustain and provide for members of the U.S. military. This process, which is reviewed annually, is lengthy and often quite partisan. U.S. Sen. Roy Blunt, R-Mo., sent out a tweet praising the National Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year 2019. He said it includes the largest pay raise in nearly 10 years and provides our service members with the resources, equipment and training they need. We wanted to take a closer look and see if service members were getting everything that Blunt asserted that they would. Thegoal of the act,as stated in its introduction, was to restore readiness and increase capability and capacity in a force that has been asked to do too much with too little for too long. The bill, approved in August, proposed a military budget $639.1 billion with funds divided into areas including: $17.7 billion to rehabilitate and replace worn out Army equipment. $23.5 billion to sustain, repair and rebuild crumbling military buildings and other infrastructure. $36.3 billion to restore Americas strength at sea. $40.8 billion to overcome the crisis in military aviation by getting more aircraft in the air. $69 billion to fund Overseas Contingency Operations. Overseas Contingency Operations are defined as a separate pot of funding that is set aside and operated by the Department of Defense and the State Department. They are sometimes referred to as war funds. The other large component of the act was to provide a 2.6 percent pay raise for those currently serving. This also extended special pay and bonuses for those in high demand fields. To compare the pay raise that service members could receive in 2019 to the ones they have received in the past decade, we reached out to Blunts team. It sent usrecords of the annual pay adjustmentsfor those who have served dating back to 2007. Fiscal year of 2010 was the last time a pay raise greater than 2.6 percent was awarded. From 2011 to 2016, the pay raise remained under 2 percent. Mark Cancian, a Center for Strategic and International Studies senior advisor on the International Security Program, shared records of military and civilian pay increases, including estimates up to 2023. The information was published by the Department of Defenses Comptroller inTable 5-12of National Defense Budget Estimates for fiscal year 2019. Experts we reached out to agreed that the first part of Blunts statement rang true. Although last years pay raise is just shy of 2.6 percent, the last pay raise higher that was higher was offered nine years ago. Todd Harrison, the strategic centers director of defense budget analysis, said that is is fair to say that the bill fully authorizes the level of total funding that the Department of Defense requested. Blunt said that members of the military would receive their highest pay raise in nearly 10 years thanks to legislation signed in August. Military compensation records and experts in defense analysis and government spending fields verified that this was correct.",1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,True

Final Rating: Mostly True  ","In a recent year, the Milwaukee Police Department collected more guns per capita off the streets than in New York.","Gun violence has racked the city of Milwaukee for decades, and May saw a weekend with a new set of shocking headlines, as 21 people were injured in three late-night shootings near Milwaukee's crowded Deer District after a Bucks playoff game. Tackling gun violence was among the issues at the top of Cavalier Johnson'spriority list in his successful bid to win the Milwaukee mayors office. Days after his historic win, Johnson had this to say April 9, 2022, on PBS Wisconsins Here & Now show, telling anchor Frederica Freyberg: Unfortunately, at the local level, we dont control gun law. We just react to it. In one of the more recent years in Milwaukee, our police department collected more guns per capita off the streets than in New York. That caught our attention, given the vast difference in size —and reputations —between the two cities. Is Johnson right? Lets start with gun recoveries by the Milwaukee Police Department, a number that has been on the rise in recent years. 2015: 2,504 guns recovered 2016: 2,421 2017: 2,753 2018: 2,908 2019: 2,621 2020: 3,097 2021: 3,279 As of April 20, 2022, the police department had recovered 927 guns —compared with the 681 reported at about the same time the year before. To be sure, a per-capita approach is the best way to compare Milwaukee and New York City, which is approximately 10 times larger. In this case, though, Johnson was pretty vague in declaring the city led in one of the more recent years. Which year? When asked for backup, Johnsons staff pointed to 2016 and provided two articles —one published by the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, the other by Wiscontext, which is part of PBS Wisconsin. Both articles reported that Milwaukee had a higher gun recovery per capita versus some of the countrys largest metropolitan cities. In 2016, the 2,421 guns recovered by Milwaukee police translated into a rate of 406.84 guns per 100,000 people, according to the Journal Sentinel article. That same year, New York City reported 3,583 gun recoveries, which translated into about 42 per 100,000 people, according to a 2017 report issued by the city of Chicago. The numbers do not include any guns obtained through turn-in or buyback programs. The city of Chicago report was comparing its experience withthat of other large cities, and was largely aimed at determining where guns used in crimes come from. In any case, that means the rate in Milwaukee, in that year, was 10 times that of New York. Milwaukee even surpassed two other major U.S. cities featured in the report: Chicago and Los Angeles. In 2016, Chicago counted 6,644 gun recoveries, with a rate of 244 per 100,000 people, while Los Angeles had 5,908 gun recoveries in the same year, with 149 per 100,000. Many factorsgo into gun recoveries, including more aggressive policing, special patrols and initiatives and the like. But Johnson made a narrow, focused claim, and on it hit the mark. Indeed, as the Journal Sentinel article noted, Milwaukee police routinely recover guns at a higher rate than many other major cities —so, truly, Johnson probably would have been safe even if he had been more expansive in making his point. Johnson claimed that in a recent year, the Milwaukee Police Department collected more guns per capita off the streets than in New York. Although the time frame Johnson referredto was vague, the claim was on point, as Milwaukees gun recoveries per capita numbers in 2016 were more than 10 times higher than what New York City reported for that year.",1.0,0.0,1.0,0.8,0.0,0.1,0.5,0.5,0.7,Mostly True

Final Rating: True  ","Wisconsin property taxes, as a percentage of personal income, are the lowest that they've been since the end of World War II.","Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker recited a number of statistical accomplishments during his seventh state of the state speech on Jan. 10, 2017, including one that dates back to two decades before he was born. Property taxes -- as a percentage of our personal income in this state -- are the lowest that they've been since the end of World War II, the 49-year-old Republican said. Think about that -- since the end of World War II. Cutting property taxes has been a priority since Walker took office in 2011, as is shown on our Walk-O-Meter, which tracks the governors campaign promises. But on the measure Walker cited, are property taxes lower than they have been in generations? The speech Figures highlighted during a formal address such as the annual state of the state speech are likely to have been well vetted. But as we found during our live fact checking of Walkers speech on Twitter, the governor made some statements that could benefit from clarification. Walker said more people were employed in Wisconsin in 2016 than at any time in history. When that same claim was made in June 2016 it rated Mostly True. But we pointed out economists generally prefer the unemployment rate, which accounts for population growth over time. Walkers speech also touted listening sessions he has held throughout the state. But as we found in checking an August 2016 claim by a potential 2018 gubernatorial candidate, Democratic state Rep. Dana Wachs of Eau Claire, Walkers sessions were invite-only and excluding the press. World War II times To back Walkers statement on property taxes, the governors office pointed to a July 2015 memo from the nonprofit Wisconsin Taxpayer Alliance. The memo stated that Wisconsins property tax burden was at 3.6 percent of personal income, the lowest since 1946 (when it was also 3.6 percent). Dale Knapp, the alliances research director, gave us the raw numbers: The levy was $9.45 billion in 2015 on property taxes payable in 2016. That figure amounts to 3.6 percent of total personal income of $263.3 billion in 2015. Knapp told us comparing property taxes to income is one way to see how much of a take property taxes have on the states economy. He said the memo reflects the most recent figures available. (A note: In a January 2017 report, the nonpartisan Wisconsin Legislative Fiscal Bureau measured property taxes versus income at 10 intervals dating back to 1970. Wisconsins property tax level per $1,000 of personal income exceeded the national average during each period and ranked 12th nationally in 2014, the latest year covered in the report.) Tamarine Cornelius, an analyst with the nonprofit Wisconsin Budget Project, didnt dispute the taxpayer alliances 3.6 percent figure. But she told us one thing to note is that some people havent benefited as much from Walkers property tax cuts. For instance, Walkers 2011-13 state budget stopped inflation adjustments for the state Homestead Credit, which softens the impact of property taxes and rent on persons with lower incomes. The program can put more than $1,100 back in peoples pockets through income tax refunds. For 2016, people with a household income of less than $24,680 could qualify for the credits. Cornelius cited figures from the state fiscal bureau showing that the credits have been reduced by $133.5 million since Walker ended the inflation adjustments. That means the money stayed in state coffers rather than being refunded to residents. The office of state Senate Minority Leader Jennifer Shilling, D-La Crosse, also pointed to Walker's budget moves, including limits on how much school districts can levy in property taxes,in noting thatmore than half of Wisconsin's 424 school districts have passed referendum initiatives since the beginning of 2012. Our rating Walker said Wisconsin property taxes, as a percentage of personal income, are the lowest that they've been since the end of World War II. Its worth noting that one change Walker made reduces income tax refunds given to lower-income taxpayers through the state Homestead Credit, which is aimed at softening the impact of property taxes. But an analysis by the respected Wisconsin Taxpayers Alliance shows that on the measure Walker cited, property taxes are the lowest they have been since 1946.",1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,True

Final Rating: True  ",Says Central Texas river water sent to downstream rice farmers in 2011 equaled about three years worth of Austins water use.,"Austin-area residents worried about drought might rue an agencys 2011 decision to let thousands of gallons of water from the Highland Lakes flow past the capital to downstream farmers, the head of the Austin Water Utility said. A May 27, 2014, news story said: Massive releases of water to rice farmers downstream that greatly reduced lake levels in 2011, the single driest year in Central Texas history, didnt help either. The story--by StateImpact Texas, a collaboration of KUT Austin and KUHF Houston--then quoted Greg Meszaros, the utilitys director, as saying: Comparison-wise, about three years worth of Austins water use was sent to rice farmers that year. That much? Asked the basis of Meszaros comparison, utility spokesman Daryl Slusher referred to annual reports on water use from the Lower Colorado River Authority, which oversees water releases from the chain of man-made lakes along the Colorado River running through Austin: Buchanan, Inks, LBJ, Marble Falls, Travis and Austin. By email, Slusher said the reports show that in 2011, the latest year the authority sent water downstream to rice farmers, the provided water was three times the amount of water used by Austin in 2011, 2012 or 2013. According to the authoritys March 30, 2012, report on water use in 2011, the authority that year released 529,580 acre-feet in water for downstream agricultural purposes, including rice farming. That broke down to 433,251 acre-feet let go from the Highland Lakes plus 96,329 acre-feet of water used by farmers from the river alone, the report says. An acre-foot, 325,851 gallons, is roughly equal to the water used by three average Austin households in a year. And the 529,580 acre-feet of water that went to farmers compares to Austin using 168,334 acre-feet of water that year, the report states, including 61,712 acre-feet diverted from the Colorado River at Lake Austin and 106,622 acre-feet obtained from the Highland Lakes under a city contract with the authority. This result suggests the water released to farmers was equal to a little more than three times what Austin used that year. Also, Slusher pointed out that according to the authority, Austin used less water in 2012 (151,495 acre-feet) and even less again (142,027 acre-feet) in 2013, widening the 3-to-1 ratio for those years. Another way to suss Meszaros claim, Slusher wrote, lies in adding up the last three years worth of Austins water use, which gets us 461,856 acre-feet, or 13 percent less than the 529,580 acre-feet released to farmers in 2011. Our ruling Meszaros said billions of gallons of river water released to downstream rice farmers in 2011 equaled about three years worth of Austins water use. Equaled or exceeded is the long and short of it. TRUE – The statement is accurate and theres nothing significant missing.

Final Rating: True","Rep. Paul Ryan's budget proposal cuts nothing from Medicare, Social Security or defense in the next two to three years, and in three years, he does not cut one dime from the debt.","President Ronald Reagan's former budget director, David Stockman, has taken on a new public role calling out both Democrats and Republicans for failing to address budget deficits quickly, using spending cuts and tax increases.Democrats need to accept cuts to entitlement programs like Social Security and Medicare, Stockman wrote in a recent New York Times op-ed, while Republicans should accept tax increases, not only for the rich, but also for the middle class. Stockman appeared on the roundtable This Week with Christiane Amanpour on May 1 to make similar arguments.Prior to the roundtable, Amanpour interviewed Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wisc. As the chair of the House Budget Committee, he created a broad budget proposal that the U.S. House of Representatives approved, mostly along party lines, on April 15. It's unlikely the proposal will become law; Senate Democrats and President Barack Obama oppose the plan.Stockman didn't have kind words for Ryan's outline.I think both parties are delusional in thinking that this is a long-run problem. The Ryan plan gets the balanced budget in 2030, the fiscal hereafter. We have a here-and-now problem, Stockman said. Now, what does Ryan do in the next two or three years? Nothing. He cuts $600 (billion) or $700 billion of spending, mostly from a small part of the budget, discretionary and the safety net, leaves Medicare totally untouched for three years, leaves Social Security totally untouched for 10 years, leaves defense totally untouched for the next three years, and then, after cutting that small amount, gives it all back by extending all the Bush tax cuts that we can't afford. ... In three years, he does not cut one dime from the debt. Ryan's budget proposal accepts cuts already proposed by Secretary of Defense Robert Gates but doesn't suggest additional reductions. Ryan's budget proposal uses the same numbers for defense spending as the White House's proposed 2012 budget, though Obama has since suggested additional cuts to defense. The reductions amount to $78 billion over the next five years, a small number considering defense got approximately $720 billion in 2011 alone. Ryan's budget slows the future growth of defense spending, but he doesn't actually reduce it.Ryan's proposal says explicitly that the first job of government is national defense and rejects deep, across-the-board cuts in funding for national defense. (On this point, Ryan's proposal has attracted critics both for proposing too much and too little. A commentator with the libertarian Cato Institute says defense should be cut more, while one from the conservative Heritage Foundation says the spending isn't enough to achieve U.S. security goals.)We checked the proposal's numbers with Todd Harrison, an expert on the defense budget at the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments, a research institute that focuses on defense. Even with Gates' suggested reduction, the Department of Defense budget would not actually go down -- it would essentially stay flat (only growing with inflation) for the next 12 years, Harrison said via e-mail.In three years, Ryan does not cut one dime from the debt.As Stockman noted in his comments, Ryan's proposal does cut some discretionary spending in the short term. But it's not enough to make a dent in the public debt. Keep in mind what the debt is: It's the total of all the money we've borrowed. The deficit, on the other hand, is the yearly shortfall. So making the deficit smaller each year doesn't cut the debt. As long as annual deficits exist, the debt will grow every year.Ryan's proposal reduces deficits but it does not eliminate them until 2040, 29 years from now, according to the CBO analysis. The Path to Prosperity document includes projections for the public debt between 2011 and 2021, and it shows debt going up every single year. Congress is now debating an increase in the debt limit from its current level of $14.3 trillion; Ryan's budget shows the debt increasing to $16.2 trillion in 2012 and rising every year after that up to $23.1 trillion in 2021.So Stockman's right on this one, too. True.Other viewpointsWe checked with Ryan's office for a response to Stockman's complaints. A spokesperson describes Ryan's plan as common sense gradual reforms, and pointed out that it reduces deficits compared with current policy and compared with President Obama's budget.Economic growth, combined with a real solution to rising health care costs, is the key to putting our budget on a path to balance and our economy on a path to prosperity. Tax increases kill growth, and simply cutting benefits for current seniors is not a real solution to rising health care costs, said spokesperson Conor Sweeney via e-mail.Meanwhile, we should point out that liberal critics who dislike Ryan's plan would also disagree with Stockman's critique. Short-term spending should not be reined in because it would hurt the economic recovery, they've said.Here's how New York Times columnist Paul Krugman put it recently: Why not slash deficits immediately? Because tax increases and cuts in government spending would depress economies further, worsening unemployment. And cutting spending in a deeply depressed economy is largely self-defeating even in purely fiscal terms: any savings achieved at the front end are partly offset by lower revenue, as the economy shrinks.Our rulingWhether the deficit should be reduced quickly or slowly is no doubt a debate that will continue to burn. Stockman urges a dramatic approach to cutting spending and increasing taxes quickly, while Ryan's proposal offers a more gradual approach to cutting spending, and it doesn't advocate raising taxes. Stockman said Ryan's plan leaves Medicare totally untouched for three years, leaves Social Security totally untouched for 10 years, leaves defense totally untouched for the next three years, and then, after cutting that small amount, gives it all back by extending all the Bush tax cuts that we can't afford. ... In three years, he does not cut one dime from the debt.",1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,True

Final Rating: Mostly True  ","This March, for the first time in human history, the monthly average carbon dioxide in our atmosphere exceeded 400 parts per million. The range had been 170-300 parts per million for hundreds of thousands of years.","Sheldon Whitehouse gave his 100th speech on climate change on the floor of the U.S. Senate on May 18, 2015. Over the past three years, the senator has served up several climate claims worth checking during his running series Time to wake up. So we examined his 100th installment and noticed this statement: This March, for the first time in human history, the monthly average carbon dioxide in our atmosphere exceeded 400 parts per million. The range had been 170-300 parts per million for hundreds of thousands of years. Scientists, who see climate change as Whitehouse does, say the concentration of carbon dioxide (CO2) in the earths atmosphere is increasing due, in large part, to the burning of fossil fuels. And they say rising CO2 levels are an indicator that humans are degrading the health of the planet. We went looking for evidence and quickly found a report from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration that seemed right on target. On May 6, NOAA announced that the monthly global average of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere had exceeded 400 parts per million — for the first time since it had been compiling the data in 1979. This seemed to leave only the human history part of Whitehouses claim in question. But when Whitehouse addressed the issue May 18, he did not specify his source. And, confusingly, he spoke of a monthly average not a monthly global average, the term used by NOAA. The distinction is relevant: While the NOAA monthly global average had never exceeded 400 over a period of more than 35 years, the agencys scientists had previously measured monthly average carbon dioxide levels exceeding 400 ppm in several single locations. In 2012, for example, the monthly average at the NOAA observatory in Barrow, Alaska, exceeded 400 ppm for the first time. Then the agencys observatory in Mauna Loa, Hawaii, reported that its monthly average CO2 level had exceeded 400 parts per million in April 2014. These earlier records, which were reported extensively, were based on observations from single locations while the NOAA monthly global average is based on data from 40 different sites. So Whitehouse seems to have been off a bit with his description of the monthly CO2 data. But what about human history? The senators spokesman, Seth Larson, referred us to ice-core data from Antarctica.  Scientists take core samples in Greenland and Antarctica and study the CO2 level of air bubbles — some of which have been trapped in the ice for hundreds of thousands of years. Data from Carbon Dioxide Information Analysis Center, which serves as the primary climate-change data hub of the U.S Department of Energy, show carbon dioxide concentrations ranging between 170 and 300 parts per million over the last 800,000 years. That more than covers Whitehouses in-human-history claim as humans have only been around for about 200,000, according to the Smithsonian Museum of Natural History. Before we closed the book on this one, we contacted Anthony Watts, an often-quoted global-warming skeptic. Watts claimed Whitehouse was wrong and cited the individual monthly data and a 2005 article in Nature that he said challenged the senators statement. We tracked down the lead author of the Nature, Swedish scientist Anders Moberg, and asked him about the Watts challenge. Impossible, Moberg said, explaining that his study was about temperatures in 1100 AD to 1150 AD — not carbon dioxide. For CO2 data, Moberg and John King, an oceanography professor at URI, pointed us to the ice-core research, the same data cited by Whitehouses office. The ice core records would support the Senator's statement, said King. The highest natural levels are around 300 ppm. Our ruling In his 100th speech on global warming on May 18, Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse said: This March, for the first time in human history, the monthly average carbon dioxide in our atmosphere exceeded 400 parts per million. The range had been 170-300 parts per million for hundreds of thousands of years. He probably could have been more precise if he had used the phrase global average, because there have been times when the monthly average exceed 400 parts per million at observation sites in Alaska and Hawaii. Beyond that small point, Whitehouse and his staff were on solid ground. (If you have a claim youd like PolitiFact Rhode Island to check, email us at [emailprotected].

Final Rating: True  ","The Confederate battle flag at the South Carolina statehouse must fly at a height of 30 feet. Any changes -- taken down, or even at half-staff, if that can be done -- must be passed by a supermajority of the General Assembly.","The massacre of nine African-Americans at a Charleston, S.C., church June 17 has renewed calls to remove a Confederate battle flag flying at the South Carolina statehouse. The NAACP, which has long requested the flags removal from a monument to Confederate soldiers at the statehouse in Columbia, reiterated its call this week, joined by countless politicians and almost 400,000 petitioners. Hundreds marched June 21 in South Carolina cities to protest the flag remaining unfurled on government property. One of the oddities is that while the U.S. and South Carolina flags are flying at half-staff, the Confederate flag remains at full-staff. CNN reporter Jean Casarez explained the situation to viewers on June 21. By law, it must fly at a height of 30 feet, she said. Any changes — taken down, or even at half-staff, if that can be done — must be passed by a supermajority of the General Assembly. Weve seen many versions of this claim, so we wanted to give it a closer look. South Carolinas Code of Laws allows the governor to order the lowering of the state and U.S. flags flying atop the capitol building to half-staff, which Gov. Nikki Haley has done. But according to her spokesperson, its the Legislature, not the governor, who has the legal authority to alter the Confederate flag. Title 1 Chapter 10 of state law spells it out: The flag authorized to be flown at a designated location on the grounds of the Capitol Complex is the South Carolina Infantry Battle Flag of the Confederate States of America. This flag must be flown on a flagpole located at a point on the south side of the Confederate Soldier Monument, centered on the monument, 10 feet from the base of the monument at a height of 30 feet. The provisions of this section may only be amended or repealed upon passage of an act which has received a two-thirds vote on the third reading of the bill in each branch of the General Assembly. The two-thirds vote applies to both permanent changes and temporary adjustments alike, according to the Democratic State Rep. James E. Smith, who doubts the laws constitutionality and whos been working on removing the flag since it was first moved to the grounds. The Confederate flag has been displayed at its current location since 2000, when the state passed the Heritage Act, a compromise that removed the flag from its place of sovereignty atop the capitol but allowed it to remain on the grounds. (The same piece of legislation also requires a two-third'svote by the General Assembly to make changes to Civil Rights monuments.) While the flag can be lowered physically, no one we spoke to could recall a time -- be it Memorial Day or 9/11 -- when it wasnt flying at full-staff. Its not a flag of sovereignty, its a veterans battle flag.  Should that flag be on the dome, which it should, it would be lowered, but its not, said Thomas Leland Summers, commander of the South Carolina division of the Sons of Confederate Veterans, who noted that the Confederate flag wasnt lowered to honor Civil War anniversaries. Smith, a Democratic state lawmaker, agreed, but also said: Thats beside the point. It shouldnt be flying anyway. If we were to lower it, it would give it the status of a sovereign flag, a status greater than it deserves. It should just be furled. Republican State Rep. Norman Doug Brannon told MSNBC on June 19 that he plans to sponsor a bill to remove the flag in the next legislative session. Most likely, Brannon wont be the only one, said Statehouse Report editor and publisher Andy Brack. (Smith says he wants to do better than supermajority, hed like a unanimous vote.) These deaths — especially of one of their own (Democratic State Sen. Clementa Pinckney) — might be the best chance in a decade to get the flag out of a place of prominence, Brack said. If the issue becomes a hot-button issue — so hot that legislators fear they'll lose their seats or face a challenger in the primaries for doing nothing — they could move promptly. They moved with the legislative equivalent of light speed after the death of Walter Scott in April and by June passed a bill to help pay for body cameras for police. The atmosphere is changing it appears, said Don Gordon, political science professor at Furman University in Greenville. The attempts to remove the flag from visibility off Gervais Street in front of the Capital may gain traction. The pictures on the shooter's Last Rhodesian website and the clearly racist message some feel have moved the flag from a symbol of heritage to one of blatant hate, a shifting symbolism. Our ruling A CNN reporter said, By law, (the Confederate flag at the South Carolina Capitol) must fly at a height of 30 feet. Any changes -- taken down, or even at half-staff, if that can be done -- must be passed by a supermajority of the general assembly. In 2000, South Carolina passed legislation that mandated the flags location, a height of 30 feet, and a supermajority vote to make any changes. The Confederate flag has never been removed or, to our knowledge, lowered since it was raised on the Confederate Soldiers Monument on the capitol grounds.",1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,True

Final Rating: True  ","Wisconsins 2019-21 budget produced the first positive general fund balance since 2000, and the governors proposed 2021-23 budget would return it to a deficit.","Wisconsins state government is diving into another battle over how its budget will look for the upcoming two-year period. In February, Gov. Tony Evers, a Democrat, proposed a $91 billion spending plan for 2021-23, seeking to expand Medicaid, roll back Act 10-era collective bargaining limits, legalize marijuana and raise the minimum wage -- among scores of other items intended to put the state back on its feet after the coronavirus pandemic. On May 6, 2021, the Republican-controlled Joint Finance Committee stripped nearly 400 items from Evers budget, with the co-chairs saying it included a tremendous amount of excessive spending, pet projects, tax increases and divisive non-fiscal policy. Democrats say Evers budget would fix long-standing problems in the state and honor measures that are widely popular with voters. But Republicans say their plan would keep Wisconsinites from facing a higher tax burden. Theyve also argued that the governors budget would send the states general fund back into a deficit based on a common accounting standard, after its 2019-21 budget created the first positive balance by that standard that the general fund had seen since 2000. Staff of Sen. Howard Marklein, R-Spring Green, created a chart showing as much that several members of the Republican caucus have shared on social media. Is the claim correct? Lets dig in. The chart cited depicts Wisconsins general fund deficit dating back to 2000, at which time the deficit totaled around $1 billion based on Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, or GAAP. The line peaks in fiscal year 2010-11, when the general fund deficit was nearly $3 billion, by this measure. In 2020, the chart shows a negative deficit — or rather, a positive general fund balance. An arrow then indicates that Evers proposed 2021-23 budget would return the general fund to a deficit. Gov. Evers budget is a bounce back to larger GAAP deficits, Sen. Duey Stroebel, R-Saukville, tweeted along with the chart on April 7, 2021. Adam Gibbs, communications director for the office of Senate Majority Leader Devin LeMahieu, R-Oostburg, provided an analysis from the nonpartisan Legislative Fiscal Bureau that bears some of the claim out. The analysis, which Marklein requested in December 2019, indeed shows the states general fund had been in deficit since 2000, with the largest — $2.99 billion — during fiscal year 2010-11. It ends with fiscal year 2017-18, at a $1.25 billion deficit. The general fund deficit for the following year is detailed in Wisconsins Comprehensive Annual Financial Report. In 2019, it was just under $800 million in deficit. In 2020, the tide turned and the general fund reached $1.5 million under those standard accounting principles, according to the Comprehensive Annual Financial Report for the fiscal year ending June 30. At the time, Evers credited his government for working on issues important to Wisconsinites without running up the states credit card. It was the first time Wisconsin had reached a positive GAAP fund balance since the state began issuing the comprehensive annual financial reports, he said. Evers 2021-23 budget in brief, released in February 2021, outlines a return to the general fund deficit over the next two years. In 2021, the estimated closing GAAP fund balance is still positive, at about $921 million. In 2022, its estimated at a deficit of nearly $2 million. In 2023, the estimated deficit is about $938 million. This deficit doesnt mean the states budget isnt balanced — in fact, Wisconsin is required by law to pass a balanced budget where estimated revenues are at least equal to estimated expenditures. The GAAP system, however, counts future expenditures at the time that the state commits to spending on them, even if they wont be paid until the next budget cycle. The states other method of accounting, called cash modified accrual, doesnt count expenditures until it comes time to pay them. Members of the states Republican caucus claim that Evers proposed budget would return the state to a GAAP fund deficit, after its first positive balance in the fund in decades in the biennium prior. The Legislative Fiscal Bureau analysis shows the funds deficit through fiscal year 2018, and the states annual financial report shows it turning around in 2020. In the Department of Administrations estimation of the next two years, the deficit would return in 2022 and persist through 2023.  ",1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,True

Final Rating: True  ","Contends that President Obama literally said (if) his cap-and-trade proposals were to pass, that utility rates, his words now, would, 'necessarily skyrocket.'","With Congress debating a cap-and-trade plan to reduce global warming, House Republicans are touting an alternative that they say will be less expensive.Instead of regulating carbon dioxide by forcing power companies to buy and trade polluting credits, why not subsidize renewable fuel production and build new nuclear reactors, posited GOP Congressman Mike Pence on MSNBC's  Morning Joe  on June 10, 2009. Otherwise, he said, power companies will pass the cost of buying those credits on to the consumer, driving up the price of energy.Pence wanted to make clear that he was not taking credit for that economic prediction.I don't think you need to look any further than the president himself ... who literally said [if] his cap-and-trade proposals were to pass, that utility rates, his words now, would, 'necessarily skyrocket,' said Pence. He added that Democrat John Dingle of Michigan and the Commerce Committee said people don't realize this is a tax, and a 'great big one.'It didn't take us long to find Barack Obama's original quote, which came from a videotaped interview he did with the  San Francisco Chronicle  editorial board very early in the presidential campaign, January 2008.Under my plan of a cap-and-trade system, electricity rates would necessarily skyrocket, Obama told the  Chronicle  . Coal-powered plants, you know, natural gas, you name it, whatever the plants were, whatever the industry was, they would have to retrofit their operations. That will cost money. They will pass that money on to consumers.While Obama was talking specifically about cap-and-trade, he was also making a larger point that the biggest challenge will be making sure voters understand why such a plan is necessary.The problem is can you get the American people to say this is really important, Obama said.So, Pence is right. Obama did say that cap-and-trade would be costly to power plants and to consumers.What's fuzzy, however, is  how  costly. PolitiFact has already  looked into the issue  and found that estimates vary. Republicans say each household will pay $3,100 a year, a figure they came up with based upon a Massachusetts Institute of Technology study that predicted a cap-and-trade proposal would generate $366 billion annually. On March 24, 2009, we gave the claim a Pants on Fire ruling because the GOP's calculation was badly flawed and because the GOP used the figure even though the author of the MIT study had told them it was wrong. And in an April 1 letter to House Republicans, authors of the MIT study said that the report was being misinterpreted; by their count, estimates hover closer to $340 per family.Congress has its own estimate: A 15 percent cut in carbon emissions would cost the average household about $1,600, according to a March 12, 2009, Congressional Budget Office testimony.It is worth noting that the climate debate has changed substantially since Obama sat down with the  Chronicle  nearly a year and a half ago. Legislators have opted to give 85 percent of the polluting permits away for free instead of putting them up for sale, as Obama pledged to do on the campaign trail. In theory, this approach should reduce costs to consumers. Furthermore, revenue from auctioned permits will help consumers pay for increased energy prices, according to Obama's first budget.Despite those potential cost cuts, there's still little disagreement that consumers will pay for cap-and-trade, whether it's $3,100 a year or $340. Because that hasn't changed since Obama first said that utility rates would necessarily skyrocket, and because Pence got Obama's words just right, we give Pence a True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/6ffafdf4-5637-4e52-8ff3-7d5f0ecab7f6",1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,True

Final Rating: True  ","Financial conflict-of-interest laws don't apply to the president, right? So, the president doesn't have to have a blind trust.","How President-elect Donald Trump will handle his extensive businesses and financial holdings — and the potential conflict of interest that comes with them — when he gets into the Oval Office remains an open question. Trump has said his children will manage his business dealings. Many presidents in the past have put their assets in a blind trust, which is when an independent trustee manages another persons assets without the persons input. But Trump doesnt actually have to do any of this because the financial conflict-of-interest laws dont apply to him as president, said former New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, who is reportedly on the short list for a seat on Trumps cabinet. Well, first of all, you realize that those laws don't apply to the president, right? Giuliani told CNNs Jake Tapper Nov. 13. So, the president doesn't have to have a blind trust. For some reason, when the law was written, the president was exempt. Giuliani has the law pretty much right. Trump, as president, has no legal obligation to detach himself from his businesses and financial interests. The law at issue is Title 18 Section 208 of the U.S. code. It says federal executive branch employees cant participate in government matters in which they or their immediate family has a financial interest. Because of this law, some federal employees put their investments in a blind trust. This allows them to sidestep the regulation and participate in a matter that might otherwise pose a conflict of interest. But the president and the vice president, despite being executive branch employees, are exempt. According to the laws definitions, Title 18 Section 208 does not apply to them, nor does it apply to members of Congress or federal judges. It appears that presidents have mostly escaped the normal web of ethics and conflict-of-interest laws, said Scott Amey, general counsel at the Project on Government Oversight, a nonpartisan government accountability watchdog. Amey added that presidents are allowed to accept gifts in many cases, too. Its been this way since at least 1974, when the Justice Department issued a letter saying Title 18 Section 208 did not apply to the president. Congress expressly codified the exemptions in 1989. In the 1974 letter, the Justice Department said the legislative history of this conflict-of-interest provision indicated that it was never intended to apply to the president. Additionally, the Justice Department said placing conflict-of-interest laws on the president could constrain him in a potentially unconstitutional manner, though it did not give specific examples. As the head of the executive branch, the president may not be able to — and arguably under the Constitution it might not be possible to require the president to — recuse from government decisions, said Richard Briffault, a professor of legislation at Columbia Law School. While Title 18 Section 208 is the primary conflict-of-interest provision, there are other relevant rules, including a couple that dont exempt the president. Trump and Vice President Mike Pence will have to disclose their finances, which is required of all high-level federal employees, Briffault said. But the disclosures are not as detailed as federal tax returns, which Trump has not released. Then theres the Constitutions Emoluments Clause, which bans U.S. government employees from accepting presents or compensation from foreign governments, noted Kathleen Clark, an expert on legal ethics and a law professor at Washington University in St. Louis. The Trump Organization has numerous foreign ties, including several overseas real estate deals with possible foreign government connections. In 2012, for example, Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan attended a ribbon cutting ceremony for Trump Towers Mall in Istanbul. If any of Trumps business arrangements involve the receipt of payments from foreign governments, I believe that he, or his entities from which he receives money, would have to forgo those payments, or he would have to detach from those entities, Clark said. But it's not fully clear that presidents arebound by the Emoluments Clause, and no court has weighed into answer this question. The way the clause is constructred — that itdoesn't specify the president,unlike other provisions inthe Constitution, for example— and the fact that President George Washington himself took gifts from the French government without asking Congress for permission, together make a good case that it doesn't apply to presidents,said Seth Barrett Tillman, a professor at Maynooth University in Ireland who has studied the clause. Our ruling Giuliani said financial conflict-of-interest laws don't apply to the president, right? So, the president doesn't have to have a blind trust. The president is, in fact, exempt from the primary conflict-of-interest provision in the U.S. code. So presidents do not have any legal obligation to put their financial holdings in a blind trust or to detach themselves from their financial interests in any way. As president, Trump will have to comply with financial disclosure requirements, however, and it's possible he is constrained by a clause in the Constitution regarding income from foreign governments.

Final Rating: True  ",Georgia has more illegal aliens than the state of Arizona.,"(Update: The Pew Hispanic Center recently emailed PolitiFact Georgia its latest numbers on unauthorized immigrants that update numbers in the original report below. It does not impact our ruling since that was based on numbers from the Department of Homeland Security. The report is entitled: A Portrait of Unauthorized Immigrants in the United States. It can be found at http://pewhispanic.org/reports/report.php?ReportID=107. Pew found California had the greatest number of unauthorized residents and estimated that number at between 2.5 and 2.85 million. Arizona came in sixth on the Pew Hispanic Center list with between 475,000 and 550,000 unauthorized immigrant residents. Georgia came in seventh on that list with 425,000 to 500,000.)   Cracking down on illegal immigration has become a mega-mantra for Republicans who want to be Georgias next governor.That became evident at a June 17 Republican gubernatorial debate, sponsored by the Georgia Chamber of Commerce and the Georgia Press Association.The five Republican candidates who showed up for the GOP debate all favored Georgia adopting a get-tough measure like the one passed in Arizona. But candidate Jeff Chapman, a state senator, went further. He stated that Georgia has actually surpassed Arizona in the number of immigrant residents who broke the law to enter the United States. Georgia having more illegal aliens than the state of Arizona is clearly taking away jobs, Chapman said at the debate. Georgia, a state in the Deep South, has more illegal immigrants than Arizona, a state that sits on the Mexican border and is at the epicenter of the illegal immigration political storm? We at PolitiFact Georgia were dubious.Chapman made the statement not only at the debate; he repeats it in detail on his campaign Web site. On the site, Chapman states: Officially, we have 480,000 illegal aliens in the state of Georgia. Officially, Arizona has 460,000.Georgia is, of course, a much bigger state, population-wise, than Arizona. It has a total population of 9.8 million residents, while Arizona has about 6.6 million residents. To check the numbers of illegal immigrants, we first went to the Pew Hispanic Center, which keeps a wide array of statistics on illegal immigration. Pews Web site numbers indicated California had the greatest number of illegal residents and estimated that number at between 2.5 million and 2.7 million. Arizona came in fifth on the Pew list with between 400,000 and 450,000 illegal immigrant residents. Georgia came in seventh on that list with 350,000 to 450,000.But there was a problem with the Pew numbers. They were from 2005, nearly five years old. We also checked the Web site Statemaster.com, which listed Georgia seventh with 228,000 illegal immigrants and Arizona sixth with 283,000. But those numbers turned out to be 10 years old, based on a report done in 2000.So we called a Washington-based organization known as FAIR -- Federation for American Immigration Reform. Spokesman Jack Martin said their numbers show Arizona ranks sixth with 500,000 and Georgia seventh with 495,000.But Martin said the latest numbers are kept by the Department of Homeland Security. And he recommended we contact that agency for the most updated information.That sentiment was echoed by Tom Edwards of the U.S. Census Bureau. The Census Bureau, he said, just keeps numbers on immigrants who live in the U.S., with no distinction of their legal or illegal status. If you want the most updated numbers, Edwards said, go to the Department of Homeland Security. So we did. What we found was a report titled: Estimates of the Unauthorized Immigrant Population Residing in the United States: January 2009. It was authored by Michael Hoefer, Nancy Rytina and Bryan C. Baker.The report said its estimate began with the American Community Survey (ACS) of the U.S. Census Bureau, which estimates the total foreign-born residents in the U.S. From that report, using various filters, the DHS estimated the number of illegal residents. Its a bit art, a bit science. And even the report itself cautioned that estimating the number of illegal residents is a slippery business. Annual estimates of the unauthorized immigrant population are subject to samplingerror in the ACS and considerable nonsampling error because ofuncertainty in some of the assumptions required for estimation, the report cautioned.Still, it is a highly regarded number by those in the business of counting people. And it comes up with some interesting conclusions. The greatest percentage increases in the unauthorized population between 2000and 2009 occurred in Georgia [115 percent], Nevada [55 percent], and Texas [54 percent], the report noted. The DHS report still listed California in the top spot, with 2.6 million illegal immigrants. But it placed Georgia at the No. 6 spot with 480,00 illegal residents and Arizona seventh with 460,000. Interestingly, just 10 years ago, Arizona was far ahead with 330,000 illegal immigrant residents while Georgia had only 220,000.Chapman appears to have done his homework on this subject.

Final Rating: True  ","We, the bishops of the United States -- can you believe it -- in 1919 came out for more affordable, more comprehensive, more universal health care.","The Catholic church and the White House have been clashing over contraception requirements in President Barack Obamas signature health care law. As weve noted before, the Affordable Care Act requires Catholic hospitals to provide all birth control approved by the Food and Drug Administration to their employers with no out-of-pocket costs, including birth control pills, Plan B, diaphragms and hormone shots. Coverage for emergency contraception, but not abortion, is required. Religious employers are exempt from the requirement, but the hospitals dont qualify for exemptions because they both employ and serve people who may not share their religious beliefs. In an interview with David Gregory on NBCs Meet the Press, Cardinal Timothy Dolan of New York, perhaps the most prominent member of the Catholic heirarchy in the United States, spoke out against a mandate for hospitals to provide these services, including emergency-contraception pills. At the same time, though, Dolan cited some common ground between the church and the administration its been battling. We bishops have been really kind of in a tough place because we're for universal, comprehensive, life-affirming health care, Dolan said. We, the bishops of the United States -- can you believe it -- in 1919 came out for more affordable, more comprehensive, more universal health care. That's how far back we go in this battle, okay? We wondered whether the bishops support for comprehensive health care really goes back nearly a century. Experts pointed us to the history of the National Catholic Welfare Council, the predecessor of the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops. The council held an annual meeting in which U.S. bishops discussed national policy issues such as education, welfare and health care. During the February 1919, meeting, held just after World War I, a group of bishops, led by a Catholic social reformer, Father John A. Ryan, published the Bishops Program of Social Reconstruction, a guide to overhauling U.S. social justice. Dolan was referring to a section on social insurance, his spokesman said. The state, the guide read, should make comprehensive provision for insurance against illness, invalidity, unemployment, and old age. That wasnt the last time the USCCB has supported health care expansions. For example, the group has publicly supported a variety of proposals, including former President Bill Clintons ultimately defeated health care plan in 1993. The flap is over the (contraception) issue, said Maria Mazzenga, a Catholic history archivist at The Catholic University of America. Thats where it comes to appear that theyre against universal health care. Mazzenga said that, despite opposition to one specific part of Obamacare, all but the most conservative bishops have consistently supported health care efforts over the years. Our ruling Dolan said U.S. bishops have supported expanding health care since 1919. Hes correct that the National Catholic Welfare Council published pro-health-care expansion literature that year, and experts told us that the bishops have regularly supported proposals to expand health care over the years, despite disagreements over specific provisions enacted under Obama, including contraception regulations.",1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.5,1.0,1.0,True

Final Rating: True  ",The National Park Service has an annual budget that is less than the city of Austin.,"From the mountains to the valleys and to the oceans, the U.S. government spends less money running parks than Austin devotes to city government, a federal honcho told Congress. Jonathan Jarvis, director of the National Park Service, prefaced his June 14, 2016, mention of Austin with some agency self-celebration, telling the U.S. House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform: The NPS manages many of our nations most iconic and beloved landscapes and historic sites. We are responsible for managing more than 400 individual parks with more than 84 million acres of land, stretching from Acadia National Park in the State of Maine to the National Park of American Samoa in the South Pacific. The NPS also manages numerous wild and scenic rivers and national trails; programs that recognize our nations historic structures; and programs that help local governments and organizations provide recreational opportunities and protect open space. We are seeing record-breaking visitation -- more than 300 million last year -- and the resulting economic activity created by the parks topped $16 billion. We are accomplishing all of this, Jarvis said next, on an annual budget that is less than the city of Austin, Texas. Right off, Jarvis seemed right on the numbers. For the fiscal year that began Oct. 1, 2015, the park services budget amounts to $3.4 billion, which folds in $2.85 billion appropriated by Congress plus expected fee revenue, a park service spokesman, Jeff Olson, advised by email. The service has 22,000 employees, he said. Olson, asked how Jarvis came to single out Austin, said that in preparing for the House hearing, Jarvis was looking for another government entity's budget with which to compare the NPS. Jarvis settled on Austin for his comparison after looking online for the budgets of various cities, Olson said. For the same fiscal year, the Austin City Council approved a $3.5 billion budget, according to the published city budget. A city spokesman, David Green, conceded the numerical differences though he indicated that comparing the total budgets obscures vast differences between the federal agency and Austin city government. While it is accurate to say Austins $3.5 billion budget is larger than that of the National Park Service, Green said by email, it is difficult to make a direct comparison. The City of Austin has over 13,000 employees spread across more than 40 departments – including our own Water and Electric utilities – that provide daily direct service to more than 900,000 residents. The scope and mission of the city is simply too varied to make an apples-to-apples comparison, Green said. Olson, reacting to Greens analysis, said by email: It may be difficult to compare Austin to the NPS. While the city serves 900,000 residents, the NPS serves more than 300 million visitors each year, many of them from Austin, no doubt. A federal wrinkle? We asked a pro-parks group, the National Parks Conservation Association, about Jarvis claim. By email, spokeswoman Kati Schmidt said association experts pegged the services fiscal 2016 budget at $3.377 billion after adding appropriated funds plus fees and other mandatory funding. But Schmidt also illuminated additional money coming to the park service for federal road projects. Park service roads also benefit from Highway Trust Fund dollars for maintenance totaling $268 million this year, Schmidt wrote. That $268 million would drive up the agencys total expected 2016 spending to $3.645 billion by our calculation--which would exceed Austin city governments $3.5 billion budget. But hold on: We ran this thought past the park services Olson who said by phone its fair to say the additional roads money is being spent by the agency. Yet Olson said by email the $268 million is part of the U.S. Department of Transportation budget. The associations Schmidt further told us the park services resources/facilities also benefit at times from a variety of other random smaller sources like state grants and private donations (both monetary and in-kind), but we dont have any sum total of all funding sources that benefit the system. These other sources are not technically part of the NPS budget so in terms of Jarvis reference to an annual budget, indeed the claim appears to be defensible, Schmidt said. Citing insufficient knowledge about the citys budget, Schmidt declined to speculate about whether the director made a fair apples-to-apples comparison. Some differences beyond budget totals Its worth noting the park service and Austins city government draw on divergent revenue sources. Congress, which spends tax revenue, appropriated 84 percent of the park services budget. In contrast, just 24 percent of the citys 2015-16 budget, or $818 million, was penciled in to come from tax revenue. On the other hand, the city budget shows $1.9 billion in revenue from utility charges, largely meaning income from the sale of electricity, water and wastewater services; that chunk of money covers 54 percent of the city budget. Notably, too, the city has a capital improvements budget supported by debt, grants and fund transfers. In 2015-16, the Austin City Council appropriated $629.6 million for such projects; that amount is not part of the $3.5 billion total budget, city spokeswoman Alicia Dean told us by phone. So, the city plans to spend more than $4 billion in fiscal 2016, counting the regular and capital improvements budgets. Olson told us the park services 2016 budget folds in more than $192 million budgeted by the agency for comparable construction and repair/rehabilitation purposes. Put another way, he said, that money is part of the $3.4 billion total budget. Our ruling Jarvis said the National Park Service has an annual budget that is less than the budget for the city of Austin. For the fiscal year through September 2016, this is so by $100 million--though there are arguably plenty of differences between the agency and Austin city government that keep this comparison from meaning a great deal.

Final Rating: True",Says the media distortedwhat happened with a baby at his rally.,"Donald Trump is crying foul at news reports alleging he kicked a crying baby out of a Virginia rally last week. The media is going crazy. They totally distort so many things on purpose. Crimea, nuclear, the baby and so much more. Very dishonest! he tweeted. We looked into his widelyreported comments on Crimea and a host of other issues. But is it true that babygate isnt based on reality? Trumps charge of media distortion sticks. The scandal started at an Aug. 2 Trump rally in Ashburn, Va. As he was talking about trade, a baby began to cry in the audience, prompting the famously off-the-cuff Trump to chime in. I love babies. I hear that baby cry, I like it, he said. What a baby. What a beautiful baby. Don't worry, don't worry. The mom's running around, like, don't worry about it, you know. It's young and beautiful and healthy, and that's what we want. As the baby continued to cry, Trump continued to comment. Actually I was only kidding, you can get the baby out of here, he said. I think she really believed me that I love having a baby crying while I'm speaking. That's okay. People don't understand. That's okay. These sentences caught fire in the press. Heres a smattering of headlines from a variety of media outlets: • New York Daily News: SEE IT: Donald Trump kicks crying baby out of rally • Rolling Stone: Watch Donald Trump Throw Crying Baby Out of Rally • New York Times: Donald Trump Jousts With a Crying Baby at His Rally • Fox News: Trump has infant removed from rally for making noise • Salon:  You can get that baby out of here: Donald Trump, upstaged by crying baby, orders it removed from rally • Wired: Trump didnt just banish a baby. He banished a mother • Baltimore Sun: Trump banished the baby, humiliated the mother But, as our friends at the Washington Post Fact Checker reported, Trump didnt actually kick the baby out of his rally.  Toronto Star reporter Daniel Dale cleared things up that day, writing that Trumps get the baby out of here comment came as the mother was already exiting. A joke? Possibly. An insensitive, heartless, ordinary-person-embarrassing remark? Possibly. Trumps tone is eternally hard to read, Dale wrote. But, to my eyes, it certainly was not an ejection — it was an unusually barbed endorsement of the mothers own decision to depart. NBC reporter Katy Tur was also at the event and said comment was very clearly a joke and the baby stayed. Tur reported about the incident on Bloombergs With All Due Respect (around the 30 minute mark). Another guest on the program, the Washington Posts Phil Rucker, agreed: I was there, too. It was a joke. It was definitely a joke. The Associated Press reported that after saying you can get that baby out of here, Trump then seemed to suggest that he was joking and the baby could stay. The child soon stopped crying. Devan Ebert, the mother herself, said as much in widely circulated Facebook posts soon after the news reports began appearing. Ebert confirmed to PolitiFact that this statement came from her: I excused myself and my child when he awoke from his nap and began to cry. It was only because I had to grab my child's belongings and then make my way out of the aisle I was seated in that I wasn't out of there sooner. ... I fully support Mr. Trump. I thought he responded very graciously to my child crying and he made a lighthearted moment out of what I usually consider to be stressful. I actually was out of the auditorium before he even made his follow up comment about my child and even then, when I was informed of his comment. I laughed. I understand he says things jokingly, and I understand no one wants to speak over or struggle to listen over a crying baby. I am in no way offended and I again reiterate, Mr. Trump NEVER kicked me or my child out of the Briar Woods High School, Trump rally. Ebert reiterated this in an interview, telling us she was never kicked out of the rally and Trump still has her vote. I appreciate that Mr. Trump made light of an otherwise stressful situation, she said. At the time of this report, none of the publications listed above have issued corrections or updated their stories. Our ruling Trump said the media distortedwhat happened with a baby at his rally. Many media outlets reported that Trump threw out or ejected a crying baby from a campaign event in Virginia, based on his commentary on the incident. But this isnt true. Trumps comments came as the mother was already voluntarily exiting from the rally. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/598870c7-2bbd-47a5-8d22-04f0a67ebc97",1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,True

Those ads ran for 20 years, starting in the mid-1970s.So whats the latest at the companys huge central city plant?The lock maker, a division of Fortune Brands Home & Security, Inc., was founded in Milwaukee in 1921.Fifteen years ago, Master Lock had about 1,154 workers at its Milwaukee plant, 2600 N. 32nd Street, a sprawling facility thats been described as the size of seven football fields. That year, Master Lock announced that it would begin importing locks from China, a move that began a string of large job reductions in Milwaukee.Two years later, the company announced that it would open a lock assembly factory in Nogales, Mexico. Because of the outsourcing and competition from those cheaper locks made elsewhere, employment in the Milwaukee plant fell to about 270 employees in 2003, the company said.The cost advantages of overseas production began to decline in the late 2000s. By the end of 2010, the company said, several dozen jobs were moved back to Milwaukee. Employment grew to 379, news reports said.In early 2011, company executives used the full capacity description of production in a Journal Sentinel story about the return of the outsourced jobs. That message returned at a White House meeting in January 2012, and again in the State of the Union address.The White House meeting was a in-sourcing forum. At that event, the president singled out Master Lock for praise.The company says employment in Milwaukee is now 412. Master Lock still operates factories in China and Mexico.So what does it mean when the company and Obama say that the plant is operating at full capacity? After all, there are nearly 750 fewer people working there than 15 years ago.Without providing specifics or revenue figures, Master Lock said in a written statement that the Milwaukee plant is a far different operation than it was in 1997.The Milwaukee plant is producing parts and components at a much higher volume than in 1997, reflecting our regained market share and Master Lock's overall revenue growth, which is approximately double 1997 revenues, the company said. Moreover, Milwaukee-made production is now being sold directly to Master Lock customers in China, reflecting its new competitiveness. Master Lock said it decided to re-size and convert Milwaukee into a more automated and highly efficient manufacturer of parts and components regardless of final assembly destination.Such lean manufacturing efforts have paid off for many companies, said Nick Hayes, a partner with FiveTwelve Group Ltd., a business research and consulting firm in Milwaukee.Manufacturers can become far more efficient by using automation, high-tech equipment and streamlining the way they move supplies and inventory around a factory, he said.Hayes offered an example of a factory he worked with that adopted lean manufacturing. The company downsized from a 60,000 square foot factory and 100 workers to one that was two-thirds smaller, with half the work force. Production increased 10-fold.The question I would have for Master Lock is how primitive were they before? Hayes said.Consumer demand for the product is another critical factor, he said. And Master Lock indicated that sales had increased.Without providing specifics, Master Lock said it hoped to continue to add jobs in Milwaukee.We plan to invest in the plant this year to add capacity as we in-source more work. We are also investing in training and working with area technical colleges and universities to find and equip skilled workers.Our conclusionObama singled out Master Lock saying the company brought back outsourced jobs and is operating at capacity for the first time in 15 years. Thats the same thing Master Lock executives said more than a year ago, and theyve continued to add jobs and said they would continue to do so. It also tracks with their efforts to attract a more highly skilled work force to run an updated operation.",1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,True

Final Rating: True  ",The number of inmates since 2000 on death row dying of natural causes has now surpassed the number of inmates executed.,"House Speaker Dean Cannon thinks the Florida court system overstepped its authority last year when it removed three Constitutional amendment questions from the statewide ballot. So, in 2011, he's talking about comprehensive court reform.Addressing a group of nearly 50 reporters and editors at the annual pre-session meeting organized by the Associated Press, Cannon again made his case that the court system should not have removed constitutional amendments that, if approved by voters, would have granted tax breaks for first-time home buyers and affected state redistricting. A third amendment was drafted in response to the new federal health care law to prohibit Florida from participating in any health insurance exchange that compels people to buy insurance.All three amendments were stripped from the ballot after judges ruled that the attached ballot language was either flawed or misleading.Cannon said he will propose legislative changes to effectively remove or diminish judicial review of ballot questions.But that's not all.Florida's judicial system has the authority to take away not only a person's liberty, but also a person's life. Understanding the severity and irreversible nature of that penalty, we have a responsibility to ensure that justice is administered not only fairly, but also efficiently, Cannon said. Criminal cases are complex in nature and in recent years we've seen cases overturned, and there have been errors. The number of inmates since 2000 on death row dying of natural causes has now surpassed the number of inmates executed. Significant and unreasonable delays plague the current process of conducting state post-conviction review in these cases and it appears that there is little the Supreme Court can do to improve or streamline the process.Cannon said that is where the Legislature can step in.I believe the Legislature can and should work with the judicial branch to significantly improve the administration of justice in death penalty cases, he said. I am hopeful that reform could lead to a more equitable judicial system for all Floridians, and as we move forward toward the 2011 legislative session, we will continue to explore this issue to determine when and what the right course of action for Florida may be.Cannon hasn't specified what court reform legislation might look like, though by his comments it sure sounds like he wants the appeals process in death row cases hastened. In that vein, we decided to check his facts about Florida's death row, focusing on this claim: The number of inmates since 2000 on death row dying of natural causes has now surpassed the number of inmates executed.Of the 392 people now on Florida's death row,House records indicate that145 inmateshave been there for 20 years or longer and 34have been there for 30 years or more, according to Cannon spokeswoman Katie Betta.Gary Alvord has been on Florida's death row since April 1974, according to the Florida Department of Corrections. Alvord escaped a Michigan mental hospital and wound up in Tampa, where he killed three women. Alvord, who turned 64 on Jan. 10, 2011, has been on death row for more than 13,400 days. This April, he will have been awaiting execution for37 years.John Vining, who was sentenced to death in 1990, is the oldest person on death row. On March 13, 2011, he will turn 80.Vining wasconvicted of shooting and killing a woman who was trying to sell him a $60,000 diamond.Since Florida reinstated the death penalty in 1976 (and began carrying out sentences in 1979), 69 people have been executed -- a rate of a little over two per year. One reason, for starters,is a lengthy and costly appeals process. But politics plays a role as well. The governor must sign a death warrant for an execution to proceed.And sometimesother complicating factors are cited.Alvord, for instance, has a long history of mental illness and has been declared mentally incompetent by several courts.The last person to be executed in Florida was Martin Grossman in February 2010. Grossman was convicted of shooting a Pinellas County wildlife officer who happened upon Grossman shooting a stolen handgun in a wooded area.Gov. Charlie Crist signed the death warrant of David Eugene Johnston in 2010 as well, but Johnston died while awaiting his sentence. He was convicted of stabbing an 84-year-old Orlando woman to death in 1983.That transitions naturally to Cannon's claim.The Florida Department of Corrections provided PolitiFact Florida with a list of 55 inmates who died on death row starting Jan. 1, 2000. Thirty of the 55 somehow died while awaiting their sentence (the state does not describe the nature of a person's death), and 25 were executed.For example, Eddie Lee Sexton Sr. died on Dec. 29, 2010, while living on death row. Sexton was convicted of murder after a jury found that he ordered his mentally impaired son to strangle Sexton's son-in-law at a Florida park. Sexton feared that the son-in-law was going to report family abuses to local authorities, prosecutors said. Sexton was sentenced to death in 1998.Robert Power died on Dec. 3, 2010, while awaiting sentence for the rape and murder of a 12-year-old Orange County girl. Power had been on death row for 20 years. The waiting and appeals process certainly comes with additional cost. The Death Penalty Information Center, a Washington policy group that does not advocate for or against the death penalty, published a 2009 report discussing the cost of enforcing the death penalty. The group cited a 2000 Palm Beach Post analysis, which said that the state spends $51 million a year enforcing the death penalty. That's $51 million a year more than it would cost to punish all first-degree murderers with life in prison instead. The figure has been repeated by several other news publications as well as Rex Dimmig, chief assistant public defender of the 10th Judicial Circuit, in testimony before a state Senate committee discussing the death penalty.Make no mistake, the death penalty is a controversial and complex policy issue. But here, we're focusing on Cannon's call for reforms based on death row inmate data. He said: The number of inmates since 2000 on death row dying of natural causes has now surpassed the number of inmates executed. He's right. Of the 55 death row inmates to die since Jan. 1, 2000, only 25 actually were executed.",1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,True

Final Rating: True  ",Sherrod Brown has voted with Barack Obama 95 percent of the time.,"Republicans in Washington, D.C., and Ohio have vast ideological differences with U.S. Sen. Sherrod Brown, an Ohio Democrat.Brown says the government plays a positive role in peoples lives when it provides a safety net (new health insurance programs, financial regulation, help for cash-strapped cities and schools) while supporting the private sector. Republicans say the government needs to step back to propel the economic engine that is the private sector.While lofty, that makes for a poor sound bite. But the GOP knows this, and is prepared to frame its November election effort against Brown like this: When you look at his voting record, what's going to stick with voters is that he has voted with Barack Obama 95 percent of the time. He can talk about differences some of the time, but you've got to look at the record.That quote comes from Christopher Maloney, communications director for the Ohio Republican Party. Maloney made the claim to The Plain Dealer during a telephone interview in December 2011, and again with a slight variation on Jan. 22, 2012, that well discuss in a moment. It is that variation that we're checking here.The interview was for a story, published Jan. 23, on how Republicans plan to campaign against Brown in the coming political season. While the newspaper checked out the figure and had reason to believe it was accurate, it also believed -- for purposes of PolitiFact Ohio -- that the figure deserved further examination, and a ruling on the Truth-O-Meter. After all, voters are likely to hear the claim a lot this year.Maloney said his figure came from Congressional Quarterly, a nonpartisan journalism organization that reports on Capitol Hill lawmaking dispassionately. CQ, as it is known, serves as a bit of a bible for journalists, congressional offices and even lobbyists, because it goes into the weeds of legislating like few other publications do. Its reporting winds up in CQ Today, CQ Weekly, CQ online products, and an annual hard-bound political almanac, Politics in America.Besides covering hearings and more, CQ examines voting patterns for every member of Congress and sorts them in ways that allow comparisons. One of those ways is through an annual examination of presidential support, or the number and percentage of votes by each lawmaker on bills in which the sitting president has staked a position.So, for example, CQ counted a vote for the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, better known as the economic stimulus bill, as a vote in support of the president. The same principle applied to the health care reform vote of 2010, to votes on taxes, the debt ceiling, and so on. Presidents weigh in on fewer than half of all Senate votes (Obama had a position on 39 percent of the Senates 235 votes last year), and some bills have broad bipartisan support no matter who is in the White House.No lawmaker winds up with a presidential support score of zero -- not even such small-government fans as Republicans Jim DeMint of South Carolina or Rand Paul of Kentucky. But the closer to zero, or to 100, a score is, the higher the lawmakers opposition or support for the presidents agenda.Back to the figure Maloney cited: He stated from the start that his source was CQ. He originally said the figure for Brown was 97 percent -- that is, that Brown has voted with President Obama 97 percent of the time. That was based on an average of CQ ratings, for 2009 (Obamas first year, when Brown scored 96 percent) and 2010 (98 percent). Maloney was accurate when he made the statement because CQ Weekly had not yet published its ratings for 2011.That changed, just before The Plain Dealer was about to publish its story. A new issue of CQ Weekly came out, with new numbers covering 2011. And the positions of Brown and Obama, it turns out, diverged slightly more often in 2011 than in the previous two years.Browns presidential support rating dropped to 92 percent in 2011 -- matching, it turns out, the 92 percent support rate that other Democratic senators had on average for the president last year. In contrast, Browns Ohio colleague, Republican freshman Rob Portman, voted with the president 59.5 percent of the time in 2011 -- which while not as high as the 71.90 percent rate of Maine Republican Susan Collins, still put Portman in the top tier, at 13th, of Republicans voting most often for Obamas positions. DeMint and Paul, by contrast, each had presidential support ratings of 41 percent in 2011.When averaged for the three years of Obamas presidency so far, then, Browns support fell from 97 percent to 95 percent. (Do the math: 96 plus 98 plus 92, divided by 3, equals 95.3.) Maloney, when told by The Plain Dealer that CQ had had just put out brand new figures, updated his statement to reflect that 95 percent rate.We report this without judgment on whether it is good or bad to support the Obama agenda. Brown has disagreed with Obama on foreign trade and on some greenhouse gas-regulation issues. But Maloney says that youve got to look at the record.And the record -- compiled not by an opposition party but by a publication regarded as eminently impartial -- provides an average of 95 percent. The figure is current. On the Truth-O-Meter, Maloneys claim merits a rating of True.",1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,True

Final Rating: True  ","There is nothing in the current state public records law that prohibits sensitive or confidential business information from being just that, confidential.","New Gov. John Kasich has made it clear his top priority while in office is to bring jobs to Ohio and turn the economy around.JobsOhio, a publicly funded, private nonprofit corporation, is Kasichs big idea to attract businesses here and create jobs. The nonprofit corporation will act as a privatized version of the Department of Developments economic development efforts. Yet the transition of this public agency, which Kasich has described as sluggish and ineffective, to the private sector has raised concerns about transparency and accountability.Kasich, a Republican, wants JobsOhio to be exempt from Ohios public records and open meetings laws. The corporation would be audited annually to show the public its spending. But Democrats have loudly criticized the exemptions, saying they would keep the corporations operations under wraps and out of the public view, inviting scandal and a misuse of taxpayers dollars. Kasich and other Republicans say the exemptions are needed to help JobsOhio move at the speed of business. Public disclosure could disrupt business negotiations, they argue.State Rep. Matt Lundy, a Democrat from Elyria, is not convinced JobsOhio needs to be shielded from public records laws, and he has introduced legislation to subject the corporation to those rules.There is nothing in the current state public records law that prohibits sensitive or confidential business information from being just that, confidential, Lundy said in a Feb. 7 news release announcing his legislation, which he called the Taxpayers Right to Know Act.Republicans control the Ohio House of Representatives, so Lundys bill is unlikely to get much attention. But since his effort highlights ongoing concerns about JobsOhio, PolitiFact Ohio decided to check out Lundys claim and examine how Ohios public records laws treat the states interactions with outside businesses.Ohios public records law, section 149.43 of Ohio Revised Code, establishes the public availability of records kept by public offices, whether its a city hall or local school district or the governor. The law also includes numerous exceptions, which range from a police officers home address to adoption records.These exceptions also apply to certain business records.Sensitive business records often fall within the trade secrets exception to Ohios public records law, said David Marburger, an attorney for Baker Hostetler in Cleveland and counsel for the Ohio Coalition for Open Government. Marburger, who often represents The Plain Dealer on issues of public access to government, called the trade secrets exception extremely broad.Ohio Revised Code section 1333.61 defines a trade secret as any information, including business information, financial information, technical information, formulas, names addresses and telephone numbers, of actual or potential economic value.Marburger said the trade secret exception is a nearly impenetrable shield when a government entity and a business share sensitive or confidential information.Kent State University School of Journalism and Mass Communication professor Tim Smith agreed. He also cited the trade secrets exception when asked about Lundys statement. From my knowledge about the open records law, Lundys statement is accurate, said Smith, a former managing editor for the Akron Beacon Journal.Kasichs administration and Republicans in the House of Representatives, which already has approved the JobsOhio plan, have offered a cross-section of scenarios in which public disclosure would impede JobsOhios mission. (The Republican-controlled Ohio Senate is still reviewing the plan.) For example, if communication between JobsOhio and a sought-after company was public record, another states could use that information to trump Ohios offer.PolitiFact Ohio is not rating whether JobsOhio should be exempted from public records laws. Regardless of the advantages or disadvantages, Lundys statement that Ohios public records law includes exceptions that protect sensitive and confidential business information is correct.On the Truth-O-Meter it earns a rating of True.",1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,True

Final Rating: True  ",There are countries in Africa where they have higher vaccination rates than here in the United States.,"Sunday show talking heads continued to debate vaccinations of children -- specifically, how there should be no debate -- as they analyzed political missteps from the past week. BBC World News America anchor Katherine Katty Kay made a startling comparison to highlight how Americans have been less diligent in making sure their children are properly immunized. There are countries in Africa where they have higher vaccination rates than here in the United States, Kay said on NBCs Meet the Press. Because when people really need it,and they see the effects that measles can have on their communities, they will make sure that their children vaccinate. Rhetoric about the measles outbreak stemming from Disneyland in California, home to a significant measles-resistant population, is keeping PunditFactand PolitiFactbusy. We wanted to continue our look at this re-emerging viral threat by examining the accuracy of Kays claim. While we did not hear back from her by our deadline, we have a pretty good idea of Kays source. The World Health Organization, which recommends infants be vaccinated with at least one dose of the MMR vaccine before their first birthday, maintains immunization rates for the measles vaccine among 1-year-olds by country. The most recent data is for 2013. There were 16 African countries that beat the U.S. rate of 91 percentfor the measles-mumps-rubella vaccinein 2013, according to the WHO data. (TheCenters for Disease Control and Prevention putsthe measles immunization rate in the United States is91.9 percent.But the WHO and CDC measure the statistic in different ways, and as you'll see, it doesn't make a difference.) The countries besting the United States are Algeria, Botswana, Burundi, Egypt, Eritrea, Gambia, Kenya, Lesotho, Libya, Mauritius, Morocco, Rwanda, Seychelles, Tanzania, Tunisia and Zimbabwe. United States  91 percent * Algeria 95 percent Botswana 94 percent Burundi 98 percent Egypt 96 percent Eritrea 96 percent Gambia 96 percent Kenya 93 percent Lesotho 92 percent Libya 98 percent Mauritius 99 percent Morocco 99 percent Rwanda 97 percent Seychelles 97 percent Tanzania 99 percent Tunisia 94 percent Zimbabwe 93 percent  Of course, many African countries facing steep impoverished conditions have lower and substantially lower rates, such as Central African Republic (25 percent), Chad (59 percent), Equatorial Guinea (42 percent), Ethiopia (62 percent), Nigeria (59 percent), South Sudan (30 percent) and South Africa (66 percent). More broadly, its not just African countries beating the United States. Latin American countries with rates about the same as or exceeding the United States include El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras and Mexico. South Africa-based think tank Good Governance Africa spurred news about the United States trailing some African countries in a Feb. 5 press release highlighting the WHO data. Researcher Kate van Niekerk hailed the improved availability and widespread usage of the vaccine as a major public health success that has reduced child deaths even though the disease continues to kill about 400 children every day. Still, Dr. Cathy Troisi, infectious disease epidemiologist at the University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston School of Public Health, said the nearly universal use of the measles vaccine in some parts of Africa is the result of a large international effort to reduce child mortality. Reducing by two-thirds the under-five mortality rate between 1990 and 2015 was one target of the United Nations millenium goals. Unlike in some regions of Africa, where measles remains a leading cause of child death, some American parents are strangers to scary, eradicated diseases that afflicted prior generations, she said. Americans also generally value individual rights over community needs, she added. Im old enough that I was born before the polio vaccine became available, Troisi said, and you can bet when it came out, my mom was first in line to get me vaccinated. Part of the reason were seeing this refusal is because parents havent seen what these diseases can do. Because we were curious, we wondered how the U.S. vaccination rate stacked up against its more populous companions. The U.S. population is about 319 million, making it the third-most populated country. China, with 1.36 billion people, is at 99 percent. India, with 1.24 billion people, has a rate of 74 percent. Indonesia, at 253 million residents, had a rate of 84 percent. Brazil and its population of more than 200 million residents had a measles vaccination rate of 99 percent. Our ruling Kay said, There are countries in Africa where they have higher vaccination rates than here in the United States. We found ample evidence to back up her point, with several African countries boasting better vaccination rates than the United States. Mauritius, Tanzania and Morocco have nearly complete vaccination of 1-year-olds, according to World Health Organization data.",1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,True

Final Rating: True",Over 50% of the people now in the House and state Senate have not been born in Virginia.,"U.S. Rep. Denver Riggleman, R-5th, recently accused the newly-elected Democratic majority in the General Assembly of embracing liberal policies that are out of sync with Virginia. Democrats last fall won control of both legislative chambers for the first time this century. Riggleman, during a Jan. 23 radio interview on the John Fredericks Show, said the party has gone absolutely loco in passing gun control bills, proposing a gas tax hike to improve roads and backing measures he said will hurt small businesses. He said Democrats could be facing the shortest tenure ever for a majority, based on the craziness coming out of the state legislature. He added, Over 50% of the people now in the House and the state Senate have not been born in Virginia. And most of them, completely new. Theyre not even Virginians by grace yet. We fact-checked Rigglemans statistic. Well leave it to you to determine what, if anything, qualifies a person to be a Virginian by grace. The numbers To learn where lawmakers were born, we consulted their biographies on the House and Senate websites and in General Assembly manuals. In a few cases, we turned to newspaper stories or asked legislative aides. The newly-elected House of Delegates sworn in last month has 52 members born outside Virginia and 48 born inside the state. The newly-elected Senate has 22 members born outside the state and 18 born within. Combining the chambers, 74 legislators were born outside Virginia, 66 inside. Thats a flip from 2019, when Republicans held narrow majorities in both chambers. In the House 52 delegates were born in Virginia, 48 werent. In the Senate, 22 were born in Virginia, 18 were not. Combing the chambers, 74 lawmakers were born inside Virginia, 66 outside. In other words, there was a net addition in both chambers of four members born outside the state. But these numbers are tricky and dont suggest - as Riggleman implies - that those born outside Virginia are alien to its culture. Nine current General Assembly members (six senators and three delegates) listed as being born out of state were delivered across the Potomac River in Washington D.C. Their biographies show six of them (four senators and two delegates) graduated from high school or college in Virginia. If counted, Rigglemans claim about out-of-state majorities would fall. Twelve other legislators were born in states bordering Virginia: North Carolina; Maryland; West Virginia; Kentucky; and Tennessee. Republican Del. Terry Kilgore, for example, has lived in Gate City in Southwest Virginia for all of his life, except when he attended college and law school in other parts of Virginia. But he was born in a hospital 20 miles away in Kingsport, Tenn. and - in Rigglemans claim - doesnt count as a native-born Virginian. Demographics So far, weve been focusing on the details of numbers between 2019 and 2020 and, by strict count, there has been a transition to where a majority of General Assembly members were born out of Virginia. But a broader trend emerges if we use 1960 as our starting point. The increase in non-Virginia legislators over the past 60 years reflects the increase in non-native-born Virginians living in the state. In 1960, Virginia was in the final years of domination by a political machine controlled by Democratic U.S. Sen. Harry Byrd that was rural in origin and segregationist. The House of Delegates had 96 Democrats and four Republicans; the Senate had 38 Democrats and two Republicans. Eighty-five percent of the legislators were born in Virginia, as was 71% of the states population. These days, Virginias politics are dominated by a suburban crescent arching from Northern Virginia through Hampton Roads. Theres been a large migration to the state through these suburbs - particularly Northern Virginia - by a professional class of government workers and contractors. The U.S. Census Bureau estimated that 50.5% of the states population in 2018 was born outside Virginia. That nearly matches the 52% of legislators this year who were not born in Virginia. People like to vote for people who reflect them, said Larry Sabato, a University of Virginia political scientist. These legislators reflect the people they represent. Rigglemans living in the past. Weve become a different state, said Bob Holsworth, a political scientist and consultant. I certainly understand some people who regret that some of the traditions have gone by, but in terms of overall prospects (offered by Virginia), theres a big difference between now and 65 years ago. By the way Although its not part of fact-check rating, we took a quick look at Rigglemans contention that most of the out-of-state legislators were elected last year. Hes wrong. Only nine of the 52 non-Virginia born delegates were elected last fall, as were only five of the 22 senators born out of state. Our ruling Riggleman says, Over 50% of the people now in the House and state Senate have not been born in Virginia. Fifty-two delegates in the 100-member House were born outside of Virginia; so were 22 members of the 40-seat Senate. We have trouble with Rigglemans implication that those born outside Virginia are out of step with the state. Many born outside the state grew up and were educated in Virginia. Moreover, the 52% percent of lawmakers born in other places nearly matches the 50.5% of Virginia citizens born elsewhere. ",1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,True

Final Rating: Mostly True","We have 17 intelligence agencies, civilian and military, who have all concluded that these espionage attacks, these cyberattacks, come from the highest levels of the Kremlin, and they are designed to influence our election.","Editor's note: We've attached an update to this fact-check below in response to reader queries after subsequent testimony by James Clapper. The original fact-check and rating remain unchanged. In one of the most heated moments of the final presidential debate, Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton clashed over Russias interference in the current election. Speaking of the WikiLeaks release of tens of thousands of emails from the Clinton campaign and, earlier, the Democratic National Committee, Trump said Clinton had no idea who hacked and released the emails — Russia, China or anybody else. Clinton responded by asking Trump if he really doesnt believe the 17 federal intelligence agencies that have said Russia is behind the cyberattack. We have 17 intelligence agencies, civilian and military, who have all concluded that these espionage attacks, these cyberattacks, come from the highest levels of the Kremlin, and they are designed to influence our election, Clinton said. I find that deeply disturbing. Back in July, when WikiLeaks released the DNC emails, the government hadnt yet named a culprit. On Oct. 7, however — the same day WikiLeaks released the emails of Clinton campaign chair John Podesta — the Homeland Security Department and Office of the Director of National Intelligence released a joint statement that said, The U.S. Intelligence Community (USIC) is confident that the Russian Government directed the recent compromises of emails from U.S. persons and institutions, including from U.S. political organizations. The statement added that the recent hacks are consistent with the methods and motivations of Russian-directed efforts. These thefts and disclosures are intended to interfere with the US election process. The statement also said the intelligence community believes these attacks are directed from top levels of the Russian government, as Clinton said. We believe, based on the scope and sensitivity of these efforts, that only Russia's senior-most officials could have authorized these activities, the statement said. The U.S. Intelligence Community is made up of 17 agencies, forming the basis of Clintons claim. The 17 agencies are: Air Force Intelligence, Army Intelligence, Central Intelligence Agency, Coast Guard Intelligence, Defense Intelligence Agency, Energy Department, Homeland Security Department, State Department, Treasury Department, Drug Enforcement Administration, Federal Bureau of Investigation, Marine Corps Intelligence, National Geospatial Intelligence Agency, National Reconnaissance Office, National Security Agency, Navy Intelligence and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence. The 17 separate agencies did not independently declare Russia the perpetrator behind the hacks. Trump spokesman Steven Cheung said that this cuts against Clintons point, saying, It is unlikely that all 16 of the agencies had looked independently at the Russian connection, which is what Clinton seemed to indicate. (Cheung said 16 agencies because he omitted the Office of the Director of National Intelligence from his count.) However, as the head of the 17-agency intelligence community, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, headed by James Clapper, speaks on behalf of the group. Our ruling Clinton said, We have 17 intelligence agencies, civilian and military, who have all concluded that these espionage attacks, these cyberattacks, come from the highest levels of the Kremlin, and they are designed to influence our election. We dont know how many separate investigations into the attacks they were. But the Director of National Intelligence, which speaks for the countrys 17 federal intelligence agencies, released a joint statement saying the intelligence community at large is confident that Russia is behind recent hacks into political organizations emails. The statement sourced the attacks to the highest levels of the Russian government and said they are designed to interfere with the current election. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/542ece9a-ae39-433c-8215-4a41906b75c9 The now former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper made a comment when speaking before Congress May 8, 2017, that some readers interpreted as going against our findings in this article. Heres why we disagree with that interpretation. We wrote this article Oct. 19, 2016, responding to an Oct. 7, 2016, joint statement from Clappers former office, which oversees the entire intelligence community, and Homeland Security. Clappers May 2017 congressional testimony, on the other hand, was about the much more comprehensive January 2017 report produced by the CIA, FBI and NSA. The process of putting that report together didnt start until months after we published this article, in December 2016, at which point the intelligence community decided to restrict the investigation to those three agencies. Heres what Clapper said, according to Congressional Quarterly. (ICA refers to the January 2017 intelligence community assessment.) Additionally, I'll briefly address four related topics that have emerged since the ICA was produced. Because of both classification and some executive privilege strictures requested by the White House, there are limits to what I can discuss. And of course my direct official knowledge of any of this stopped on 20 January when my term of office was happily over. As you know, the (ICA) was a coordinated product from three agencies; CIA, NSA, and the FBI not all 17 components of the intelligence community. Those three under the aegis of my former office. Following an extensive intelligence reporting about many Russian efforts to collect on and influence the outcome of the presidential election, President Obama asked us to do this in early December and have it completed before the end of his term. The January report presented its findings by saying we assess, with we meaning an assessment by all three agencies. The October statement, on the other hand, said The U.S. Intelligence Community (USIC) is confident in its assessment. As we noted in the article, the 17 separate agencies did not independently come to this conclusion, but as the head of the intelligence community, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence speaks on behalf of the group.

Final Rating: True","If you look at the number of illegal immigrants coming into the country, it is net zero. It's been that way now for almost two years.","As millions watch them during their national convention in Tampa, Republicans are trying to appear tough on illegal immigration without offending Hispanic voters.Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, who is bilingual and met his wife in Mexico, has warned his fellow Republicans they need to watch their tone on the immigration issue. He repeated that warning in an interview on Meet the Press the weekend before the convention.My personal view is that we need to get beyond where we are, Bush said. We need to create a climate of border control. And thats begun to happen, if you look at the number of illegal immigrants coming into the country, its net zero. Its been that way now for almost two years. And if you say, well, weve gotten a much better grasp on the number of people just coming in without papers, then you could develop a strategy thats part of economic growth. For this fact-check, we will research whether Bush was correct when he said the number of illegal immigrants coming into the country is net zero, and that its been that way for two years.Pew Hispanic Center studiesWe turned to the Pew Hispanic Center for an answer. The center is a nonpartisan research organization that does not take positions on policy issues.Its 2012 report about Mexican immigration concluded, After four decades that brought 12 million current immigrants -- most of whom came illegally -- the net migration flow from Mexico to the United States has stopped and may have reversed. The report was based on the centers analysis of federal census data.We interviewed Jeffrey Passel, a senior demographer at Pew and an expert on Hispanic immigration. He said that Bushs claim is true. Passel said that we can infer that the outflow of unauthorized immigrants exceeded inflows between 2007 and 2009 because the overall size of the unauthorized population living in the U.S. decreased between 2007 and 2009 from 12 million to 11.1 million.There are four ways the number of unauthorized immigrants changes: the inflow of new unauthorized immigrants, the outflow of those leaving the U.S., deaths and unauthorized immigrants gaining legal status.Those last three categories -- outflow out of the U.S., deaths and conversion to legal status -- exceeded the first category of new inflows of unauthorized immigrants by about 900,000 between 2007 and 2009. But deaths and conversion to legal status are not large figures. Therefore, Passel said, the major source of the decline is almost certainly an excess of outflow of unauthorized over inflow.You can read about Pews reports about net migration from Mexico here and in general about trends in the illegal immigration population here and here.We also sent Bushs claim to groups with opposing views on immigration and all agreed that Bushs statement was correct.I think you will find everybody agrees with it being zero or close to it, said Roy Beck, executive director of Numbers USA, which advocates for low immigration.A spokeswoman for The National Immigration Forum, which advocates for immigrants, sent us a New York Times op-ed piece co-written by two professors, one a former foreign minister of Mexico and the other co-director of the Mexican Migration Project at Princeton. That op-ed piece also stated that the rate of undocumented immigration is nearing zero. Our rulingBush said If you look at the number of illegal immigrants coming into the country, it is net zero. It's been that way now for almost two years.It is difficult to get a precise figure on the population of illegal immigrants. But data from Pew Hispanic Center, a widely respected source referred to by those of different political viewpoints on immigration, supports Bushs claim.",1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,True

Final Rating: Mostly True  ",Every family health insurance policy has a $900 hidden tax to subsidize health care costs of the uninsured.,"You know youre going to bankrupt the country with health care, right? talk show host Bill OReilly began as an introduction to talk with Sen. Hillary Clinton about her health care plan. Oh, no, Im not, said Clinton, who appeared on theThe OReilly Factoron April 30, 2008. Clinton boiled her plan down to this: Everybody who has health insurance whos happy with it, you keep it. No changes. But what I am going to do is take an already existing plan -- its not government-run, its not a new bureaucracy. Its the way Congress and federal employees get their health care. And were going to open it up to every American, because I think its about time... But youre going to subsidize it, OReilly interjected. Well, we are, Clinton said. But heres why. You already are subsidizing it. Your family policy has a $900 hidden tax. Why? Because when some poor person who doesnt have health insurance... ...goes to the emergency room...youve got to pick it up, OReilly said, finishing her sentence. The $900 figure is key to Clintons plan. Yes, she is saying, the government will subsidize her health care plan. But, the thinking goes, private insurance companies will charge lower premiums to their existing customers because they will no longer have to subsidize health care costs incurred by uninsured people. Think of it like this, said John Sheils, senior vice president of The Lewin Group, a non-partisan group that has analyzed health care plans for both Democrats and Republicans: Someone shoplifts a loaf of bread from the grocery story. The price of bread is inflated a bit for everyone else to offset the stores loss. Thats kind of whats going on with healthcare, Sheils said. Hospitals have to treat people who come in and need medical care. And if those people dont pay, its kind of like walking out of the story without paying for bread, he said. The cost is shifted onto those with private insurance. Sheils said Clintons claim that family health insurance policies subsidize the uninsured to the tune of about $900 a year is in the ballpark. Sheils believes the number is a little lower, closer to $800 per year. Hillary cites that same $900 figure in her formal health care proposal, the American Health Choices Plan. One cause of the crisis in the health care system is that rather than containing costs, the system shifts them: about half of all hospital losses are passed along to other payers, according to her plan. Rather than reducing prices, the system raises families costs. And, rather than covering all Americans, the system charges insured families a hidden tax: premiums are roughly $900 higher to pay for the cost of care for the uninsured. It cites a report from Families USA called Paying a Premium: The added cost of care for the uninsured. The report was based on an analysis of data by Kenneth E. Thorpe, former Clinton administration health expert, now a professor at Emory University. Thorpe says Clintons figure actually is low. According to his analysis, about $922 of a family policy was used to subsidize the uninsured in 2005. But the cost of health care has gone up since then, as have the number of uninsured. In 2008, the number is closer to $1,270, he said. The only way for hospitals to offset the costs (of the uninsured) is to have private insurers pay more than its worth, Thorpe said. It is their only means to stay financially solvent. In 2005, private health paid about 25% more than the cost of care in hospitals, Thorpe said, citing a Medicare Payment Advisory Commission report to Congress. OReilly didnt contest Clintons numbers, but he did take umbrage with subsidizing other peoples health care. I mean, I dont want to be paying for someone whos taking heroin and drinking a bottle of gin a day, OReilly said. But I assume you want to pay for some hardworking families whose kid has juvenile diabetes, Clinton said. Or some woman... that just gets diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis. I dont mind doing it, OReilly said. Clintons point was that, to an extent, family health policy holders already are shouldering some of the burden for the uninsured. There may be some debate about whether the number is exactly $900 a year, as she stated, but several health policy experts agreed that shes at least close.

Final Rating: Mostly True  ",The 12 hottest years on record have come in the last 15 years.,"During his State of the Union address, President Barack Obama touted the countrys progress in reducing carbon pollution emissions but added that recent advances in fuel efficiency and renewable energy have not done enough to curb climate change.For the sake of our children and our future, we must do more to combat climate change, Obama said. Now, its true that no single event makes a trend. But the fact is, the 12 hottest years on record have all come in the last 15. Heat waves, droughts, wildfires, floods – all are now more frequent and more intense.In 2012, the country experienced severe weather threats including drought, a devastating Hurricane Sandy and severe thunderstorms. We decided to fact-check whether the 12 hottest years on record have all come since 1998.The White House directed us to NASAs Goddard Institute for Space Studies, which tracks global surface temperatures. The institute concluded that 2012 was the ninth-warmest year on record, with 2010 and 2005 being the all-time highs.For the contiguous United States, 2012 was the countrys warmest year yet. It beat the previous record by one degree Fahrenheit. (Science nerds can read more about how these temperatures are calculated here and here.)Reto Ruedy, a program manager at the Goddard Institute, told PolitiFact that the institutes data produces the following ranking of hottest years. Items on the same line are statistically tied.1-2: 2010, 20053-8: 2007, 1998, 2002, 2003, 2006, 20099-12: 2012, 2011, 2001, 200413: 200814: 199715: 1995This analysis shows that 13 of the warmest years have occurred in the past 15 years. Alternately, one could say that 12 of the warmest years came in the last 13.We see a few other issues to note.• The NASA data set isnt the only one available. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration also analyzes global surface temperatures using its own methodology. The two measurements diverge somewhat -- NOAA considers 2012 the 10th-warmest year on record since records began in 1880, rather than the ninth.However, NOAAs data for land and ocean temperature anomalies shows that 14 of the past 15 years were the hottest on record.• There are other ways one could measure hottest years. Kevin Trenberth, a scientist with the National Center for Atmospheric Research, agreed with the 13-of-15 calculation. But he added that the NASA and NOAA values refer to global mean surface temperature. One could define hottest in other ways, such as by how much Arctic sea ice there is, he said.Our rulingObama said, The 12 hottest years on record have all come in the last 15. Data from NASA shows 13 of the hottest years on record have come in the last 15, and by a different data set produced by NOAA, 14 of the hottest years on record have come in the last 15.",1.0,0.0,1.0,0.8,0.0,0.0,0.5,1.0,1.0,Mostly True

Final Rating: Mostly True  ","As Dane County executive, Kathleen Falk raised property taxes by millions of dollars every year and approved the second highest increase in the state in 2010.","Democrat Kathleen Falks bid to knock Gov. Scott Walker out in a likely recall election is subjecting her 14-year tenure as Dane County executive to attacks by Republicans.Led by Lt. Gov. Rebecca Kleefisch, they are labeling Falk a classic Madison tax-and-spend liberal -- one out of step with the times.In a national economic downturn, Wisconsin families cannot afford to have a leader with an addiction to taxing and spending, Kleefisch wrote in an opinion piece published by Madisons Capital Times on Feb. 3, 2012. The failed policies Falk has consistently stood for throughout her career are exactly the same policies that led Wisconsin down an irresponsible path to a $3.6 billion budget deficit.Kleefisch went on to cite chapter and verse:As Dane County executive, Falk raised taxes by millions of dollars every year, most notably in 2010, when she increased taxes by 8 percent, the second highest increase across the entire state of Wisconsin.The op-ed piece contrasts these claims with Walkers state budget, which Kleefisch says was balanced without raising taxes on Wisconsin families.Weve labeled inaccurate, multiple times, the GOP claim that Walker didnt raise taxes. He came close, and he cut taxes more than he raised them in his budget overall, but he reduced tax credits for some lower-income working people, which the nonpartisan Legislative Fiscal Bureau has scored as tax increases.Asked to back up the claim about Falk, the Walker campaign -- speaking for Kleefisch -- pointed us to property tax figures compiled by Dane County and the Wisconsin Taxpayers Alliance, a nonpartisan research group. Falks approach as executive from 1997 to 2011 was to limit increases in the property tax levy to inflation with a factor built in for population growth. It was an effort to tie increases to service demand, said Scott McDonell, chairman of the Dane County Board, which largely approved of Falks approach. Did Falks budget raise property taxes by 8 percent in 2010, the second highest in the state? Yes.In 2010, Falk busted past her self-imposed levy limit of 1.19 percent for that year. She blamed lagging sales tax and other revenue due to the Great Recession, and said higher property taxes, a 3 percent wage cut negotiated with county unions and efficiency moves would preserve needed services.Ill be the first to say Im not one bit comfortable with this levy increase, but using the formula would have resulted in painful cuts to public safety and human services that are unacceptable to me, Falk said at the time.The 8 percent hike was second-highest behind Green County.Did Falks budgets raise the levy by millions every year?We analyzed the data and found that in Dane County, the property tax levy went up in a range from $2 million to $9 million every year. Thats in the neighborhood of 3 percent to 5 percent increases annually -- with the exception of 2010.So the millions every year is accurate, though its worth pointing out that Dane County is nearly a half-billion-a-year operation supported by $133 million in tax levy -- so it doesnt take a big percentage increase to get to millions of new property taxes in a year.Falks campaign defends her budget record, saying her property tax cap was landmark. She, like Walker, touts the fact that she balanced budgets, though both were legally bound to do so.The numbers showed Falks self-imposed limits held down property tax increases to the point that only 15 counties had a lower cumulative tax levy increase during that time, we found. Dane County ranked 57th among 72 counties, with 72 being the lowest levy increase.By comparison, under then-County Executive Walker, Milwaukee County was fifth-lowest (68th ranked) from 2002 to 2011.So both were in the bottom 20 percent of tax raisers, with Milwaukee County close to the champion of frugality.Indeed, both counties raised property taxes: Danes levy went up $59 million in Falks 14 years, while Milwaukees rose $51 million over Walkers nine years.The difference: While Falk and the board gave themselves a cap on growth, Walker proposed zero tax levy increases each year and vetoed attempts to add to the levy. But the County Board almost always overrode him, complaining his budgets were unrealistic.To be sure, Walker started each budget with the new, higher base. In effect, he used the new taxes he opposed one year to help his budget for the next year. So if you compare the tax levy he sought in his first budget to that in his last, it is up.Our conclusionKleefisch takes on Falks record of consistent property tax levy increases.While we found Dane County on the low side for tax hikes during Falks 14 years, Kleefischs main point is that taxes went up every year under Falk, and spiked one year. They did.",1.0,0.1,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.2,0.2,1.0,0.9,Mostly True

Final Rating: True  ",2008 was the deadliest year of the war (in Afghanistan) for American forces.,"Long since eclipsed by Iraq, the Afghan conflict, known to the military as Operation Enduring Freedom, has often been relegated to the back pages of the newspaper. Even as it has faded from view, however, the war has grown ever deadlier, President Barack Obama said in a speech to government officials and military officers at the White House on March 27, 2009. It's been more than seven years since the Taliban was removed from power, yet war rages on, and insurgents control parts of Afghanistan and Pakistan, Obama said, announcing the deployment of 17,000 more troops to Afghanistan. Attacks against our troops, our NATO allies, and the Afghan government have risen steadily. And most painfully, 2008 was the deadliest year of the war for American forces. We wondered if that was true and checked the latestPentagon statistics. Indeed, U.S. military deaths numbered 155 in 2008, which is the highest since the war began in 2001. The number of U.S. deaths has increased almost every year, with two exceptions. The year-to-year fatality count, from 2001 to 2008, is: 11, 48, 45, 52, 98, 98, 117, 155. In the first two months of 2009, there were 30 U.S. military deaths, putting this year on pace to be the deadliest yet. We looked for any indication that this statistic was unrepresentative of the conditions in Afghanistan. Quite the contrary — it is one of several measures by which the situation in Afghanistan has deteriorated. The number of U.S. military personnel wounded in action has also increased every year, from 33 in 2001 to 790 in 2008, totaling 2,713. Military deaths of personnel from the 21 other outside countries involved in the conflict have increased every year since 2004, to a peak so far of 139 in 2008 (and 2009 is on pace to surpass that). Afghan civilian casualties hit a high mark too last year, with 2,118 civilians killed, up from 1,523 in 2007, according to the United Nations. In testimony to the House Armed Services Committee in September, Adm. Mike Mullen, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said Taliban and al-Qaida fighters are coordinating better from safe havens in Pakistan and launching ever more sophisticated, even infantry-like attacks against fixed coalition positions. I'm not convinced we're winning it in Afghanistan, Mullen said. Defense Secretary Robert Gates told the committee Afghanistan was in some ways a more complex challenge than Iraq. We don't have a single adversary, he said. We have the Taliban, we have the Gulbuddin Hekmatyar group, we have the Haqqani network, we have narco-thugs, we have al-Qaida, we have foreign fighters. So Obama's claim is not only technically correct, but also accurately reflects the deteriorating security conditions in Afghanistan.
