13206,half-true,Chris Christie,Theres now been three independent investigations (into the bridge scandal) all of which have said that Christie did not have prior knowledge of or involvement in the lane closures.,"Aside from the national media, no one cares about Bridgegate, says New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie. On MSNBCs Morning Joe onJuly 6, host Joe Scarborough said he generally hasnt noticed New Hampshire voters asking the Republican presidential candidate about the September 2013 bridge-closing scandal. Nobody cares, Christie responded. They don't care because they know that theres now been three independent investigations all of which have said exactly the same thing I said the day after it happened. And so, at some point people just say well, you know, after three investigations -- two of them run by folks who were Democrats, Democratic legislature and Democratically appointed U.S. attorney -- you know, after a while people just say, OK, I guess he's telling the truth.  Multiple New Jersey officials close to Christie have been accused of devising a scheme to close parts of the George Washington bridge, under the guise of conducting a traffic study, causing a week of massive traffic jams in September 2013. The maneuver is widely believed to have been political retribution against officials in Fort Lee, New Jersey, which was most impacted by the lane closures. Since the week of the closures, Christie has consistently denied that he knew anything about the lane closures until after the fact. In the first few weeks after the lane closures —before many details came to light —Christie said the extensive press coverage was overblown. I had nothing to do with this: No knowledge. No authorization. No planning, he said in a radio interview in February 2014, adding that he learned about the closures from media reports afterward. Have three investigations agreed with him? Christies campaign did not respond to our requests for comment. But we have a good idea who conducted the three investigations: A Manhattan law firm, the New Jersey legislature and the U.S. Attorney for the District of New Jersey. One of these investigations has shut the door —saying Christie had no involvement —but the other two left the question open-ended. Gibson Dunn and Crutcher Christies administration commissioned law firm Gibson Dunn and Crutcher to conduct an internal probe in January 2014, soon after it came out that members of Christies senior staff knew about or were involved in the lane closures. The results of that investigation support the contention that Christie himself had nothing to do with the scandal. Our investigation found that Gov. Christie did not know of the lane realignment beforehand and had no involvement in the decision to realign the lanes, the report said. He does not recall becoming aware of the lane realignment during the period the lanes were closed, but would not have considered a traffic issue memorable in any event. A Port Authority official —who later pleaded guilty to charges stemming from the scandal —said he told Christie about the closures while they were happening,when the two were together at a Sept. 11 memorial event. Christie said he didnt remember the conversation. Gov. Christies account of these events rings true, the report continued, noting that document reviews and witness interviews fully corroborated Christies story. According to the The Wall Street Journal, Gibson Dunn attorney Randy Mastro said, Our findings today are a vindication of Gov. Christie.  New Jersey Legislature A December 2014 report out of the New Jersey Legislative Select Committee on Investigation came to a much less definitive conclusion on Christies involvement. The investigation found no conclusive evidence as to whether Christie knew about the lane closures in advance or while they were happening. The report said a lack of information from some key witnesses leaves open the question of when the governor first learned of the closures and what he was told. The inquiry found no smoking gun implicating Christie, but the committee concluded that it is not in a position currently to conclude what Gov. Christie himself knew about the lane closures or when and how his knowledge of these events developed. U.S. Attorney investigation A U.S. Attorney for the District of New Jersey investigation, made public in May 2015, did not find evidence that Christie was criminally involved in planning or concealing the bridge scandal. The investigation resulted in charges of conspiracy and other crimes against three state officials: Bridget Anne Kelly, Christies former chief of staff; Bill Baroni, a Christie-appointed executive at the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey; and David Wildstein, another Port Authority executive and one of Christies political allies. Wildstein pleaded guilty. But the U.S. Attorneys Office didnt indict Christie. Todays charges make clear that what Ive said from day one is true, I had no knowledge or involvement in the planning or execution of this act, Christie said following the indictments against his former staffers, according to the Wall Street Journal. Some critics have suggested that because still more evidence could come forward, Christie is not yet fully in the clear. Its possible that now under the pressure of criminal charges, Kelly and Baroni could reveal information that implicates Christie, wrote Tim Moran, editorial page editor of New Jerseys Star-Ledger newspaper. At the time, U.S. Attorney Paul Fishman said, Were always going to be receptive to new evidence, what I will say is this though: Based on the evidence currently available to us, were not going to charge anyone else in this scheme. Fishman also declined to comment on whether others (including Christie) will continue to be investigated for involvement. Our ruling Christie said, Theres now been three independent investigations (into the bridge scandal) all of which have said that Christie did not have prior knowledge of or involvement in the lane closures. Christie has said since day one that he had no knowledge of the scandal before or during the closures themselves. Three investigations —a law firm commissioned by Christie, the state legislature and the U.S. attorneys office —found no evidence to suggest otherwise. However, only the law firm investigation expressly stated that Christie had no knowledge of the lane closures. In contrast, the legislatures investigation suggested that its still a possibility if more evidence emerges, and the U.S. attorney didnt say the case is definitively closed. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/2d659490-7a00-4208-9747-2a9f204e6f8e"
8174,half-true,Debbie Wasserman Schultz,Says President Obama has cracked down on employers who are attracting undocumented immigrants and hiring them more than any previous president.,"President Barack Obama is the boss-buster in chief when it comes to going after employers who hire undocumented workers, according to U.S. Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, D-Fla. President Obama has the most border patrols and border security deployed at the border of any previous president, said Wasserman Schultz, in a June 20 interview on MSNBC. Obama has cracked down on employers who are attracting undocumented immigrants and hiring them more than any previous president. In a related fact-check, we gave Wasserman Schultz, who also serves as the Democratic National Committee chair, a Mostly True for her claim about border patrol and security. Here, we will explore if Obama holds the record for cracking down on employers who hire undocumented immigrants. Workplace raids vs. paperwork raids For some background, we turned to the Migration Policy Institute, a think tank that studies worldwide migration. Their 2013 paper about the history of immigration enforcement includes a chapter on workplace enforcement. We also found some background in a 2010 investigation from the Orange County Register. After multiple efforts, Congress passed the 1986 Immigration Reform and Control Act, which stated that employers couldnt knowingly hire unauthorized workers. Employers must attest that they made a good faith effort to verify the eligibility of workers by completing an I-9 form. The documents are easy to counterfeit, so the federal government developed an online employer verification system in the 1990s under President Bill Clinton, and the use of it soared after 2007. That system, now known as E-Verify, is currently voluntary, though some states mandate it for certain employers. (The Corker-Hoeven amendment to the Senate immigration bill would make it mandatory.) E-Verify spending dramatically increased under President George W. Bush and Obama. Still, immigration rules have proved difficult to enforce. As of 2010, about 8 million unauthorized immigrants worked in the United States. The federal governments worksite enforcement strategy has changed over time as well, making it difficult to compare data and declare any president the leader in cracking down on employers, experts across the political spectrum told us. At times, members in Congress have called for stiffer workplace enforcement. But when the reality hit home in their districts and led to complaints from business owners, politicians urged the federal government to ease up, according to border expert and University at Albany professor Rey Koslowski. Thats why border security has been more politically popular to fund than worksite enforcement. (We should note that a significant percentage of people working illegally don't cross the border; they simply overstay their visas.) Doris Meissner, the Immigration and Naturalization Service commissioner Clinton, called worksite enforcement a bit of a third rail. (She is one of the authors of the Migration Policy Institute paper. The Immigration and Naturalization Service is now called Immigration and Customs Enforcement, known as ICE.) Under Bush, workplace raids on factories and meatpacking plants received much attention. But after Obama took office, the Department of Homeland Security unveiled a new strategy and ditched the workplace raids, which also tended to punish employees, in favor of paper raids -- I-9 paperwork audits of employers to determine if they complied with employment eligibility verification laws. ICE will focus its resources within the worksite enforcement program on the criminal prosecution of employers who knowingly hire illegal workers in order to target the root cause of illegal immigration, Homeland Security chief Janet Napolitano said in April 2009. The change was dramatic: the number of I-9 audits soared from 503 in 2008 to more than 8,000 in 2009. Under Obama, ICE announced sanctions against major employers. That included a $1 million fine gainst Abercrombie and Fitch that grew out of an I-9 inspection in November 2008 while Bush was president, and the termination of hundreds of workers at Chipotle restaurants. In 2007, ICE arrested 92 employers, while in 2012 it arrested 240, according to ICE. Final orders -- rulings at the end of the case which show employers violated hiring rules -- also increased under Obama. In 2007, there were two final orders, while in 2012 there were 495. But Obama doesnt hold a record on final orders against employers. The numbers of final orders hit higher numbers in the 1990s. Those 495 final orders under Obama were consistently exceeded between 1992 and 1998, with a peak 1,063 final orders in 1992, according to data from the governments Immigration Statistics yearbook. Wasserman Schultz spokesman Jonathan Beeton sent us news reports showing an increase in I-9 audits and fines under Obama compared to Bush. (We were unable to obtain I-9 audit statistics from the 1990s, so we dont know if Obama holds the record merely over Bush.) Still, I-9 audits arent the only way to measure immigration enforcement. While audits have soared under Obama, other metrics have fallen, including arrests of employees, said Jessica Vaughan, director of policy studies at the Center for Immigration Studies, which favors restricting immigration. Thats not a surprise, since Obama turned the focus away from the workers and toward employers. However, by ignoring the workers, they are choosing to cut off a line of inquiry to nail employers, Vaughan told PolitiFact in an interview. We asked Vaughan if she thinks Wasserman Schultz was correct to state that Obama holds the record on enforcement of employers. It depends on which metric you choose, she said. If your metric is the number of audits, yes. If your metric is bringing cases to prosecution that seriously punish employers, to the point where I would say there would be a deterrent effect, I would strongly disagree with her statement. Additionally, I-9 audits are not a complete or perfect measurement of worksite enforcement against employers who hired illegal workers, said former U.S. Rep. Bruce Morrison, D-Conn., who chaired the immigration subcommittee from 1989 to 1991. Morrison now lobbies on immigration matters and has informally advised hospitals and other businesses that have faced I-9 audits. He described some of the I-9 audits as paperwork snafus -- for example an employer who didnt check the right box. If there are no illegals, you are more likely to be cut a break on penalties than if you hired a lot of illegals, but you get fined anyhow... he said. Trying to say who is being tougher on this aspect of enforcement I think is kind of a silly discussion, because what were people fined for? And did that help prevent unauthorized employment or not? We also interviewed Carl Hampe, an attorney at Baker McKenzie who has represented employees in immigration cases since the 1990s and was an attorney for the Senate committee that drafted the 1986 law. Hampe said that Wasserman Schultzs claim is not inaccurate, but given the changing enforcement strategies, its not quite that black and white. In the 1990s, INS handled a higher number of civil cases, while Bush focused on criminal investigations against employers and workers. Obama has pursued civil audits and criminal investigations against employers. Its hard to say whether Bush 43 or (Obama) is the hands-down winner, he said. Our ruling Wasserman Schultz said that Obama has cracked down on employers who are attracting undocumented immigrants and hiring them more than any previous president. She used the word employers and not employees here for a reason: Obama shifted away from Bushs strategy of workplace raids and turned the focus on employers. Between 2008 and 2009, immigration audits soared from 503 to more than 8,000. But other metric tell a more nuanced story. Final orders against employers, for example, were higher in the 1990s than they are now."

BREAKING NEWS: Michigan Judge Kenny orders HAND RECOUNT by an INDEPENDENT COMMISSION in the state of Michigan, following hard evidence of voting fraud by Detroit City Election Commission, says a Nov. 10 post shared more than 1,600 times. The post, which is a screenshot of a now-deleted tweet from someone named Joel Fischer, was flagged as part of Facebooks efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Since Election Day, Michigan has been the subject of numerous false or unproven claims about voter fraud. And this one fits that mold: A hand recount has not been ordered in Michigan. That is made up, said Tracy Wimmer, director of media relations for Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson. Under Michigan law, a recount is triggered if there is a vote differential of 2,000 or less. As of Nov. 11, unofficial results showed that Biden leads Trump in the state by more than 146,000 votes. While the Trump campaign has said it will call for a recount in neighboring Wisconsin, it has not said the same for Michigan. One complaint filed in Wayne County, home of Detroit — and cited in a Trump campaign lawsuit — alleges voter fraud and calls for a recount. (There is no evidence of widespread voter fraud in Michigan.) Timothy M. Kenny, chief judge of the Third Judicial Circuit Court, has not ruled on the case —nor has he called for a hand recount. Judge Kenny hasnt ruled on anything in the Costantino case — the hearing hasnt even happened yet, Wimmer said. The Facebook post is inaccurate.

20563,mostly-true,Mark Schlereth,The majority of teams (are) now spending their dollars on the offensive side of the football.,"ESPN's Mark Schlereth, a former offensive lineman for the Washington Redskins and Denver Broncos, says offenses get all the breaks these days in the National Football League. Thats one of the reasons Schlereth is picking the Broncos and quarterback Peyton Manning to beat the Seattle Seahawks in the Super Bowl 31-17. The offenses-first trend has spread from NFL policies to refereeing to the contracts teams award players, Schlereth said on Mike & Mike. We use to say defense wins championships?  Are we now at a place, Mark, with the way the game is played where the offense has the edge? asked host Mike Greenberg. Based on the way all the rules have been for the passing game and to protect the quarterback and you can't hit people, yes, certainly, Schlereth said. The rules are bent that way for the offense to have the advantage, I think, and that's why you see the majority of teams now spending their dollars on the offensive side of the football. We decided to dig a little deeper into how the NFLs 32 teams allocate their salaries to see if Schlereth is correct. NFL teams this year have a salary cap of about $123 million, which is generally the maximum teams can spend on players. There are plenty of ways for teams to manipulate that figure, and several teams spend way below the salary cap. The NFL Players Association publishes a public report showing overall spending toward the salary cap for each team but not a detailed breakdown by offense vs. defense. To find that, we turned to Spotrac.com, which provides a much more detailed position-by-position analysis. Their reporting is used by USA Today, the Guardian and others to report about NFL spending patterns. In the end, its something of an estimate, but its the best information publicly available and considered reliable. So are NFL teams predominantly spending their money building offenses as Schlereth suggested? Well start with the big numbers and work backward. For the 2013-14 year, the NFLs 32 teams spent a total of $1.7 billion on offensive players compared to $1.6 billion on defensive players. If you measured the money as a percentage, that would translate to 51.5 percent offense, 48.5 percent defense (the margin is actually closer once you consider that NFL teams spend money on a kicker and punter who are not part of either the offense or defense). For perspective, thats closer than the popular vote in the 2008 and 2012 presidential elections. Spending by individual teams varies greatly. The Philadelphia Eagles spent nearly $74 million on offensive players, compared to $38.5 million on defensive players. The Cincinnati Bengals, conversely, spent $69 million on defensive players and $45 million on offensive personnel. (Both of those teams made the playoffs.) The Seahawks and Broncos both spend more money on offense, by the way. But while the Broncos are considered the offensive team, the Seahawks actually spend a few extra million dollars on their offensive team. Team Offensive spending Defensive spending Seattle $69,386,205 $51,800,008 Denver $66,084,673 $47,763,533  Overall, of the NFLs 32 teams, 11 spent more money on defense than offense, three teams spent just about the same amount on offense and defense and 18 spent more money on offense than defense. To put that in percentages, a little more than 56 percent of teams spend more on offense and about 44 percent do not. That gives the offenses the edge, though not decisively so. One last note: By saying now, Schlereth is suggesting that the move toward spending on offenses is a recent development. Thats not necessarily correct. While salary cap data is harder to come by for previous years, we did find a Sports Illustrated list of all NFL players from 2008 and their salaries. In 2008, offensive players made $1.7 billion (the same amount they made in 2013) while defensive players made about $1.52 billion. Part of the difference is simple numbers -- NFL teams paid 85 more offensive players in 2008 than they did defensive players. Our ruling Schlereth said, The majority of teams (are) now spending their dollars on the offensive side of the football. We reached out to Schlereth through his chili sauce company (yes, really) but did not hear back. Theres definitely evidence that NFL teams are spending more money on offensive players than defensive players. It's part of the reality of NFL football, where the most expensive players are typically quarterbacks. But the disparity wasnt that significant in 2013, and its actually less than it was in 2008. Schlereth's claim is accurate but needs clarification."
19591,false,Infowars,Revealed: UN plan to flood America with 600 million migrants.,"A misleading Infowars post claims theres a United Nations plan to inundate the United States with hundreds of millions of immigrants. Revealed: UN plan to flood America with 600 million migrants, said the headline on a July 24 Infowars story. The site and its operator Alex Jones are known for peddling conspiracy theories. The story said a 2001 UN strategy documentoutlines the need to flood America and Europe with hundreds of millions of migrants in order to maintain population levels. There is a UN report on replacement migration, and Infowars lays out scenarios listed in the report. But Infowars deviates from the truth by claiming this has been the UNs agenda for decades. The report explicitly said the scenarios in its study are not meant to be recommendations in any way, but illustrations of hypothetical scenarios. The title of the report — Replacement Migration: Is It a Solution to Declining and Ageing Populations? — even questions, not asserts, whether replacement migration is a solution. This story was flagged as part of Facebooks efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The UN report said the organizations population division monitors fertility, mortality and migration trends for all countries of the world, as a basis for its official population estimates and projections. Due to two prominent trends — population decline and population aging — it conducted a study to address whether replacement migration is a solution to those issues. Replacement migration is defined as the international migration that would be needed to offset declines in the size of population and declines in the population of working age, as well as to offset the overall ageing of a population. It analyzed six replacement migration scenarios for eight low-fertility countries, including the United States, and for two regions, Europe and the European Union. It also offered additional considerations besides the scenarios. Infowars post includes a scenario outlined in the report for the United States that said that to keep a certain potential support ratio it would be necessary to have 593 million immigrants from 1995 to 2050, an average of 10.8 million per year. Press releases in six different languages accompanied the UN report, countering Infowars headline claiming that a plan had been revealed just recently. Infowars did not respond to requests for comment. The UN document at the center of the Infowars post explores replacement migration but explicitly stops short of recommendation, much less implementation. The UN has no authority to compel anyone to immigrate. Further, the document that was revealed is nearly two decades old."
19199,mostly-true,Scott Walker,"Thanks to our reforms, the average family will have an extra $322 to spend.","Engaged in a tight re-election duel with Democrat Mary Burke, Gov. Scott Walker is returning to a theme thats been a constant in his career. Tax cuts. In a new TV ad, the first-term Republican governor peers into the camera and declares: Thanks to our reforms, the average family will have an extra $322 to spend. Walker then asks: What are you going to do with your savings? A series of regular-lookin folks enthusiastically answer: Buy clothes and school supplies, buy 96 gallons of gas, new truck tires, 2,700 diapers. Burke has criticized Walkers tax cuts as tilted to the rich. That claim left out important information, namely that Walker has also cut income taxes across the board. So, what about Walkers claim of $322 in savings for an average family. When we asked Walker spokesman Tom Evenson for back up for the $322 figure, he pointed to a series of income tax cuts and property tax relief policies enacted by Walker and GOP lawmakers. Evensen said the figure is based on an average family as having four people and a median household income of $81,000. The time frame for the claimed savings, he said, is the 2014 tax year. U.S. Census figures show that a family of four in Wisconsin has a median income of that amount, or slightly higher. A family of four is a common measuring stick. About one in five family households in Wisconsin is that size. But according to the census bureau, a family of two is much more common, making up almost half of those households. There are also more three-person households than four-person ones. More notably, we found the median income across all family sizes in Wisconsin is lower than what Walker used -- $65,618. Because its a broader figure, its arguably a more representative average family income. To figure out a typical tax cut for a typical Wisconsin family, the $65,618 figure would be the income figure to use, said Tamarine Cornelius, analyst at the Wisconsin Budget Project, a program at the Wisconsin Council on Children and Families. Lets see how this plays out under both scenarios. Well break our calculations into the two major parts -- property taxes and income taxes. Property taxes Special injections of state property tax relief provided in the form of aid to schools and technical colleges helped drop the property tax bill for a median-valued home taxed at statewide average rates. That hypothetical, average property owner will see a decrease of $151 on the 2014 property tax bill compared to what they would have without the relief measures, according to estimates from the states nonpartisan budget scorekeeper, the Legislative Fiscal Bureau. Not every family at the average income level will see that savings. For one thing, not every family owns a home or property. And while the Fiscal Bureau estimate is widely cited by both parties as an illustration of changes in property taxes statewide, the bottom line on tax changes can vary widely depending on a variety of factors at the municipal level. Income taxes Using Walkers average family income figure of $81,000, the income tax cuts enacted under Walker would top $200 in 2014, based on our reading of the Fiscal Bureaus analysis of two income tax rate reductions enacted under Walker. At the $65,618 income figure, the average tax owed would drop more than $185. Bottom line Combining the two types of tax cuts shows a reduction of more than $330 in 2014 for a property-owning family at the median income level for Wisconsin families. Using the higher average family income for four people -- the one cited by Walker -- pushes the average savings over $350. Either way, the figures support the ads claim of $322. Our rating Walker tells TV viewers that Thanks to our reforms, the average family will have an extra $322 to spend. Using some solid sources, the governor accurately pegs the combined estimated savings for a median-income family from his income- and property-tax cuts. The claim needs clarification, though, because not every average family is in circumstances to receive a cut of that size, particularly if they are not property owners."
4525,mostly-false,Howard Dean,Theres a tremendous other number of public officials who have done the same thing as Hillary Clinton with a private email server.,"Morning Joe co-hosts Mika Brzezinski and Willie Geist tried a number of ways recently to get Howard Dean — former Democratic National Committee chairman and ardent Hillary Clinton supporter — to admit Clinton erred in using a private email server as secretary of state. Each time, Dean stood firm in his support for the Democratic presidential candidate. Geist then asked Dean how he would feel about a Republican doing what Clinton did. Howard, is it fair to say if this were a Republican secretary of state, and someone you were not supporting for president, asked Geist, you would be troubled by a secretary of state having a private email server in his or her home? No, I wouldnt, Dean replied, cutting Geist off, because I used to do that as governor, and I know theres a tremendous other number of public officials who have done the same thing. Geist followed up, And would only use a private server for State Department emails? Dean demurred, saying whatever she was done was within the constraints of the law at the time.(Whether Clinton violated State Department protocols or the law isunclear.) We wanted to check Deans claim that he used a private server during his days in office and that the practice is widespread among politicians. Deans emails Clinton has drawn criticism for conducting government business through an email address privately hosted on a server at her home in Chappaqua, N.Y., instead of through the State Department's system. OnMorning Joe,Dean equatedher actions with his own, as well as a tremendous other number of officials. So we looked into Deans record for insight into his past email practices.We reached out to Dean through Democracy for America, the grassroots organizing group he founded, but didnt get a response for the story. Dean, who was governor of Vermont from 1991 through 2003, faced questions about his email in 2001 when a concerned citizen requested to see his correspondence with a ski resort developer, according to an article in the Rutland Herald. Deans lawyers at the time saidthe emails were exempt from releasebecause they were conducted through the governors private account. The article also mentions that Dean used neither a government-issued email address nor the computer supplied to him by the state.Vermont state archivist Tanya Marshall said Deans administration did not transfer any emails to the state records office at the end of his tenure. So Dean clearly used a private email account while he was governor. But we could find no evidence that he used a private server as well. And there's a difference. In fact, only one other politician is on record as doing the same: Clintons Republicanpresidential rival Jeb Bush. As Florida governor from 1999 to 2007, Bush used a private server for both his personal email account and the accounts of some of his staffers. Account vs. server Many politicians use private addresses, but private servers like the one Clinton had in her basement are rarely seen, said John Wonderlich, a policy director of the Sunlight Foundation, a nonpartisan group focused on government transparency. And theres a big difference between a private account, which is generally free and simple to start, and a private server, which requires a more elaborate setup. Two other presidential candidates,Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal and former Texas Gov. Rick Perry, used private email accounts hosted by large services like Google during their time in office. With services such as Gmail, messages they sent would have been stored on Googles own servers around the world. While Google has a high level of security, email data storedon these kind oflarge commercial servers is often mined internally, for marketing purposes, for example, Wonderlich said. The Atlanticspeculatedthe Clintons may have wanted to be in control of the encryption of their correspondence, ensuring that no third parties — whether commercial, hacker, or government — were able to snoop on them. Theunorthodox approach has opened up questions about hersystems level of security. Because the server was set up outside the State Departments proverbial security fence, any protection  aside from the physical protection of the Secret Service — would have been limited to the Clintons own personal resources, according toa March 2015 article in Wired. If the server was managed without the help of a third party,you would have to have a staff thats keeping up with all the latest fixes, said Clifford Neuman, director of the University of Southern Californias Center for Computer System Security. That can be hard with a small staff, he said. Clintons campaign says she used the private account and server out of convenience, and that it enabled her to reach people quickly and keep in regular touch with her family and friends more easily given her travel schedule. While Clintons immediate predecessor, Condoleezza Rice, did not email extensively during her time in office, Colin Powell did use a private email address while he was secretary of state from 2001 to 2005. Powell, however, did not operate his own server. Our ruling In the context of discussing Hillary Clintons private email server for handling government business, Dean said, I used to do that as governor, and I know theres a tremendous other number of public officials who have done the same thing. Its possible that Dean was trying to say that many public officials have used private email accounts. But by failing to mention that Clinton also set up her own server, he completely misses the point of Geists question. Besides Clinton, Jeb Bush is the only other official who used a personal server during his time in office. That does not speak to a tremendous trend."
13699,false,Viral image,Photos show former President Barack Obama acting inappropriately with a child.,"A collage of three images being shared on Facebook suggest that former President Barack Obama was caught acting inappropriately with a child. But thats not the case, and such claims feed into a bigger, unfounded conspiracy pushed by QAnon that he and other powerful people are part of a global child sex-trafficking ring. One of the photos shows a child who appears to be bound and gagged with tape. Obama is not in this picture. Another shows a grid of smaller shots of Obama and the actor George Clooney on a boat with a child. The words, exposing herself and an arrow have been scribbled in red on top of one of the images.. The third shows Obama with his arms wrapped around a young child who is smiling while seated on his lap. This post was flagged as part of Facebooks efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) We dont know the origins of the first image, though as early as 2017 it appeared online in connection with a hoax about dead Malaysian children found without organs. Weve already fact-checked claims about the photo of Obama and Clooney, which was taken on Lake Como in 2019. Though the angle of the photo only shows the two men and a girl, other photos from that day reveal there were many people aboard, including Michelle Obama, Amal Clooney, the presidents daughter, Malia, and other guests. Several media outlets covered the boat ride and nothing nefarious was reported. The third image was taken in 2015 by Pete Souza, the White House photographer during the Obama administration. The caption: The President snuggles with his niece Savita Ng, after his sister Maya Soetoro-Ng, and her family dropped by the Oval Office. The Baltimore Sun among other news organizations published the image, and Souza posted it on Medium. By posting these images of Obama in connection with a photo thats hard to look at — of a child seemingly in distress —innocuous photos of the former president take on a new, insidious meaning. But claims connecting him to sexual misconduct with children are completely baseless. This post is consistent with a wide-ranging QAnon conspiracy theory that falsely claims that a cabal of prominent Democrats and movie stars are Satan-worshipping pedophiles."
19257,true,David Menchetti,The causation standard in Indiana is exactly the same as it is in Illinois.,"One of the hottest and most divisive topics in Illinois politics for the last 18 months has been workers compensation reform.

Bruce Rauner and business groups say the states workers compensation system is unfairly biased against employers and has led, in the most recent national report, to Illinois having the eighth highest workers compensation insurance rates in the nation. Two dominant themes have emerged in the workers compensation debate. One is that Indiana has been a magnet for Illinois business relocations because it has very low workers compensation insurance rates. The other is that Illinois has high rates because of the states no-fault workers compensation system. Any injury arising out of and in the course of employment is compensable with workers compensation benefits, including medical care and paid time off for recovery. In legal terms, Illinois has no-fault standard of causation. Thus, a pre-existing condition that is aggravated in the course of work is covered under workers compensation. Given all this, a statement made during an Illinois House committee hearing on a workers compensation reform bill might have struck an odd chord. The causation standard in Indiana is exactly the same as it is in Illinois, said David Menchetti, a labor attorney with the Chicago firm Cullen Haskins Nicholson Menchetti. Menchetti testified at the hearing in opposition to the bill, which would change Illinois causation standard to the one described in Rauners reform agenda. If Indiana is attracting businesses away from Illinois because of its low workers compensation insurance premiums, and if Illinois no-fault causation standard is the cause of its high insurance rates, could Indiana really have the same legal standard as Illinois? We decided to check. Turnaround Rauners Turnaround Agenda contains a section devoted solely to enhancing the states causation standard, and he has spoken extensively about the need to switch to a standard in which workers compensation benefits arent granted unless the workplace is more than 50 percent responsible for the injury compared to all other causes. Hes also been vocal about Illinois losing jobs and businesses to Indiana because of, among other things, Illinois high workers compensation insurance premiums. We should be kickin tails, and look whats happening to us, Rauner said in a speech in August at the Illinois State Fair. Our jobs are going to Indiana. Come on. Theyre going to Indiana. They aint going there for the weather. Rauner is not the first to invoke the states causation standard as problematic for businesses. In a 2012 brief, Attorney General Lisa Madigan wrote, To protect taxpayer dollars, the legislature must address and change the causation standard that is currently applied by the IWCC and the courts. The attorney generals office, however, has never advocated for a specific standard and has not issued an official opinion on Rauners proposal. From our perspective, there ought to be reasonable ways to change the standard that would not damage the purpose of workers compensation to ensure that employees who are injured on the job can fully recover, Madigans chief of staff, Anne Spillane, told Politifact Illinois in September. The codes The Illinois Workers Compensation Act invokes the term arising from and in the course of employment seven times in defining injuries subject to workers compensation. Likewise, the Indiana Workers Compensation code (ICC 22-3-6-1-[e]) defines injury by accident arising out of and in the course of the employment as compensable under the states workers compensation system. By contrast, Florida -- whose causation standard Rauner wants to replicate in Illinois -- adds a conditional clause in its code: If an injury arising out of and in the course of employment combines with a preexisting disease or condition to cause or prolong disability or need for treatment, the employer must pay compensation or benefits required by this chapter only to the extent that the injury arising out of and in the course of employment is and remains more than 50 percent responsible for the injury as compared to all other causes combined and thereafter remains the major contributing cause of the disability or need for treatment. Major contributing cause must be demonstrated by medical evidence only. (440.09 [b]) But if Indiana and Illinois have identical causation standards in their workers compensation statutes, why are Indianas insurance premiums so much cheaper than those paid by businesses in Illinois? Menchetti cites two primary reasons. One is that Indiana pays significantly lower workers compensation benefits. The other, he says, is that employers in Indiana, not injured employees, have first choice in medical treatment. A national compilation of workers compensation laws by the Workers Compensation Research Institute confirms that the initial choice of treating physician in Indiana lies with the employer, while in Illinois the choice is the employee. A 2015 report by nonprofit, investigative journalism website ProPublica shows that, on benefits for permanent partial disability, Illinois consistently paid more than the national average while Indiana generally was close to average. (Compensation for loss of an arm in Illinois, for example, is $439,858. The national average is $169,878, and Indiana pays $202,050.) More than just causation While the statutes in Indiana and Illinois may use the same definition for causation, how the law is interpreted and applied makes the difference on cost, says Michael Lucci, who has studied workers compensation and written extensively about it for the libertarian Illinois Policy Institute, which favors Rauners reform agenda. I think the difference youll find is largely subject to judicial interpretation and arbitration rulings, Lucci says. Causation is a difficult issue. We havent engaged particularly hard on this issue. In a recent analysis, Lucci offered a seven-point plan for reducing Illinois workers compensation insurance premiums. Changing the causation standard was not among them. The difference between eighth-most-expensive Illinois and second-least-expensive Indiana for workers compensation insurance, Lucci says, cant be bridged by changing the causation wording alone. Their arbitrators have a narrower view of what constitutes a workplace injury, Lucci says. Our ruling Attorney David Menchetti testified before the Illinois House Labor and Commerce Committee that, The causation standard in Indiana is exactly the same as it is in Illinois. State workers compensation statutes in both states confirm that Indiana and Illinois both are no-fault states in which an injury need only happen in the workplace to be covered by workers compensation. Both define qualifying injuries as those as those arising from employment with no other conditions. As noted in statements from Menchetti and Lucci -- who are on opposite sides of the larger workers compensation reform issue -- the causation standards effect on workers compensation insurance rates is open to debate. The standard itself in Illinois and Indiana statutes is not. "
3078,mostly-true,Scott Peters,"Donald Trump rooted for the housing crisis, because he knew he could make money off of it."," During Donald Trumps recent fundraising trip to San Diego, Democratic Congressman Scott Peters had some harsh words for the GOP nominee. His economic policies are dangerous, Peters, who represents much of 'America's Finest City,' told reporters on a conference call. He will say or do anything that benefits him. We cant fact check that statement because its the congressmans opinion. But Peters repeated one critique thats open to examination: This is a guy, he said of Trump, who rooted for the housing crisis, because he knew he could make money off of it.  Congressman Scott Peters, D-San Diego, campaigns at a town hall in October2014. AP Photo/Lenny Ignelzi Hillary Clinton lodged the same attack in a May campaign video. In 2006, Donald Trump was hoping for a real estate crash, the ad says, showing a picture of Trump giving two thumbs up. The ad goes on to list consequences from the Great Recession, which peaked in 2008. It lists 9 million jobs lost and 5 million families who lost their homes.  This campaignad from Hillary For America includes 2006 audio from Donald Trump about the housing market. That's followed by audio, identified as being from 2006, of Trump saying, I sort of hope that happens because then people like me would go in and buy ... If there is a bubble burst, as they call it, you know, you could make a lot of money. And the man who could be our next president was rooting for it to happen, the ad contends. Peters statement that Trump rooted for the housing crisis, clearly draws on the Clinton ad. His office referred us to the Democratic National Committee, which supplied the Clinton ad with Trumps I sort of hope that happens audio. Our national PolitiFact team checked the original claim made in May by the Clinton ad and rated it Mostly True. Heres why: I sort of hope that happens Trumps statement comes from the audiobook How to Build a Fortune, created as part ofTrump University, which has been the subject of three lawsuits from former students who allege they were ripped off by the billionaire. In 2006, real estate values had peaked and there was concern that they were overpriced, creating a bubble that could burst, producing a rapid fall in values. The man interviewing Trump for the audiobook says, There's a lot of talk, which you've no doubt heard too, about a so-called real estate bubble. What's your take on that pessimism? Well first of all, I sort of hope that happens because then people like me would go in and buy. You know, if you're in a good cash position — which I'm in a good cash position today — then people like me would go in and buy like crazy, he says in a portion of the audiobook posted by CNN. If there is a bubble burst, as they call it, you know, you can make a lot of money. Whether the bubble burst that Trump was hoping for deserves to be called a crash, especially a crash on the scale of what occurred during the Great Recession, is open to debate. Trump, in the audiobook, adds: At the same time, I don't think that (real estate bubble burst) will happen because if interest rates stay fairly low, if the dollar stays pretty much where it is or even goes a little bit higher, but basically if you have a weak dollar, this is tremendous amounts of money pouring in, so I don't think that's going to happen. I'm not a believer that the interest market, that the real estate market, is going to take a big hit. Obviously, he would turn out to be wrong. A year later, in 2007, Trump was telling the Toronto Globe and Mail that he was ready to invest in real estate because the market was starting to head down. People have been talking about the end of the cycle for 12 years, and I'm excited if it is, he told the paper. I've always made more money in bad markets than in good markets. The Trump campaign didn't respond to PolitiFact'semails. Our ruling Rep. Scott Peters, D-CA, said Donald Trump rooted for the housing crisis, because he knew he could make money off of it. His statement parallels a claim in Hillary Clintons May campaign ad: In 2006, Donald Trump was hoping for a real estate crash. Trump said on more than one occasion that he welcomed a downturn in the real estate market because it would give him a chance to buy properties at a bargain and sell them at a higher price later. What's far less clear is whether Trump was rooting for something on the scale of the Great Recession, a suggestion made in the Clinton ad, or a housing crisis, as suggested by Peters. In fact, Trumps comments in his audiobook and to the Globe and Mail show he didn't envision the financial meltdown that followed.

3870,half-true,Michael Bloomberg,There's a loophole where you can sell guns without a background check  40 percent of guns are sold that way at gun shows and over the Internet.,"Editors note: We first fact-checked this statement on July 25, 2012, and rated it Mostly True. After the shooting in Newtown, Conn., on Dec. 14, 2012, other people repeated this statistic, and new criticism of the 40 percent figure emerged. At the request of readers, we looked at the statement again, did additional reporting, and changed our rating to Half True on Jan. 30, 2013. The original item is archived here; the fact-check below reflects our additional reporting and new rating.As the nation absorbed the news about the shooting deaths in a Colorado movie theater, New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg was scathing in his criticism of the National Rifle Association. On CBS Face the Nation in July 2012, Bloomberg accused the NRA of being adamant about no controls on weapons.He said the pro-gun group leans on Congress and the White House and blocks funding for officials to enforce laws to keep guns out of the hands of criminals and the mentally unstable.We don't need more laws. We need a couple of fixes, Bloomberg said. There's a loophole where you can sell guns without a background check at a gun show, 40 percent of guns are sold that way, same thing on the Internet.  The NRA has opposed anything.Here, we will check Bloombergs statement that you can sell guns without a background check at a gun show, forty percent of guns are sold that way, same thing on the Internet. His phrasing is a little awkward, but his staff told us he meant that 40 percent of guns are sold without a background check, either at gun shows or on the Internet.Current lawBuying a gun has required a background check since the Brady Act took effect in 1994. (James Brady was badly wounded during the 1981 assassination attempt on President Ronald Reagan; he was Reagans press secretary.) Under the law, federally licensed dealers must verify that a buyer has not been convicted of a serious crime or declared mentally incompetent or is blocked for any of about 10 reasons. Typically this is done online and takes less than a day.But only licensed dealers must do this. The law doesnt apply to private sellers at gun shows, flea markets, or people who post firearms for sale on the Internet. If a private seller suspects that a buyer would be disqualified under federal rules, then they cant go through with the sale. But there is no background check, and no one needs to file any paperwork.Bloombergs office pointed us to a 1997 study by the National Institute of Justice on who owns guns and how they use them.The researchers estimated that about 40 percent of all firearm sales took place through people other than licensed dealers. They based their conclusion on data from a 1994 survey of more than 2,500 households. But its important to note that of the 2,568 households surveyed, only 251 people answered the question about the origin of their gun.We asked Philip Cook, a Duke University professor who co-authored the study, if he thinks that 40 percent estimate -- which is now more than 15 years old -- is still a current, reliable estimate of secondary market gun sales.The answer is I have no idea, Cook said. This survey was done almost 20 years ago.  Its clear there are a lot of transactions that are not through dealers. How many, were not really clear on it.  We would say its a very old number.Other scholars had similar views. Paul Blackman is a retired criminologist and former research coordinator for the NRA Institute for Legislative Action. Personally, I think your safest bet is to say that no one knows, but that the vast majority of crime guns come from some other source than gun shows, he told us.On the other hand, not much has changed in the gun market in the past two decades.Its a fairly stable market. That is to say, gun stores have had their part, police supply stores have had their part, and then there are the gun shows and private dealings about which we know very little, said Robert McCrie, of the John Jay College of Criminal Justice. Theres the knowledge that the market has been more vigorous and probably that higher vigor has been reflected in gun shows and private sales in tandem.McCrie said, The 40 percent seems about right.Gary Kleck, whose research has provided the foundation for less restrictive concealed carry laws, told PolitiFact the 40 percent estimate is probably still reasonably valid today.Little other evidenceIn 1999, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives released a report on gun shows. Investigators found that a quarter of the vendors were private sellers, not licensed dealers, and reported that felons and other prohibited persons who want to avoid Brady Act checks and records of their purchase buy firearms at these shows. They said guns from such shows had been used in drug crimes.We called the ATF and asked if there was anything more recent. They had nothing new to add. We called the National Rifle Association and the National Shooting Sports Foundation, groups that oppose new efforts to track gun transactions. Neither organization responded.The City of New York commissioned an investigation of Internet gun sales in 2011. The report said on 10 websites, it found over 25,000 weapons for sale.The report said that over 60 percent of sellers allowed a purchase to move forward even when the alleged buyer said he didnt believe he would pass a background check.Our rulingBloomberg said 40 percent of gun sales take place through gun shows or the Internet, without a background check.The best information on the informal gun market is based on a survey and is about 15 years old (the data used in the survey is almost 20 years old). Theres no question that many guns are bought with no background check, but theres not sufficient current evidence to say that the proportion is 40 percent of all sales.Bloombergs statement is partially accurate but leaves out that important detail: Half True."
19617,true,Chuck Grassley,I haven't missed a vote since 1993.,"Senators love to boast about their voting records, and Charles Grassley, a Republican from Iowa, is no exception.    During a weekly conference call with Iowa reporters, Grassley was asked about his re-election prospects this year.    I'm going to have tough competition, he said of his three opponents. Even though there's suggestions at the national level that this could be a very Republican year, I can't assume that it's going to be a very Republican year. And I'm going to have to campaign very, very hard. ... For instance, I haven't missed a vote since 1993. I hope I don't have to miss any votes this year because of a campaign.    Has Grassley really been so steadfast? We had to limit our investigation to roll call votes; in the Senate, less controversial bills or amendments are frequently adopted by unanimous consent or by voice vote, meaning members simply say aye or nay.    First, we turned to  Congressional Quarterly  , a publication that annually studies lawmakers' voting records. According to  CQ  's Web site, Grassley has had a flawless voting record since 1993. The  Washington Post   also compiles  similar information, and we found that Grassley hasn't been absent for a vote since he missed four votes on July 14, 1993. (Those votes pertained to a bill that would allow federal employees to participate in the political process so long as it was done outside of work.)    What kept Grassley from the Senate floor that day in 1993? Flooding in Iowa, according to the  Des Moines Register, noting that the senator has become the iron man of the Senate racking up ... 5,700 consecutive votes.    Indeed, as an average, Grassley has voted about 99.6 percent of the time since he took office in 1981. Other senators elected at the same time cannot tout such near-perfect records. For example, Sen. Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania has, on average, voted 93 percent of the time in the last 28 years, first as a Republican then as a Democrat. And Sen. Chris Dodd, a Democrat from Connecticut, has voted on average about 90.7 percent of the time.    Grassley has gone to great lengths to maintain his record. When, for example, a blizzard threatened Washington, D.C., on the eve of a crucial health care overhaul vote on Dec. 19, 2009, Grassley spent the night in his office to make sure he didn't miss it.    Bc of potential blizzard I've come to office to sleep,  he Tweeted  the night of the 18th. Vote at 720am vote Sat. Hv not missed vote 7/93. 5700 votes consecutive.    Grassley said he hadn't missed a vote since 1993, which is certainly correct for every recorded vote. Grassley has every right to brag. We give him a True."
19998,half-true,Barack Obama,The costs for families (in the individual market) for the same type of coverage that they're currently receiving would go down 14 percent to 20 percent.,"For many people, the health care issue boils down to this: Are my insurance rates going to go up or down? Not surprisingly then, one of the testiest exchanges at the health care summit on Feb. 25, 2010, came between President Barack Obama and Sen. Lamar Alexander, R-Tenn., over the issue of how the Democrats' health care plan would affect premiums. Interestingly, both cited an analysis of the Senate health care bill by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office to make their case. The Congressional Budget Office report says that premiums will rise in the individual market as a result of the Senate bill, Alexander said. No, no, no, no, Obama retorted. This is an example of where we've got to get our facts straight. Let me respond to what you just said, Lamar, because it's not factually accurate, Obama continued. Here's what the Congressional Budget Office says. The costs for families for the same type of coverage that they're currently receiving would go down 14 percent to 20 percent. What the Congressional Budget Office says is that because now they've got a better deal, because policies are cheaper, they may choose to buy better coverage than they have right now, and that might be 10 percent to 13 percent more expensive than the bad insurance that they had previously. But they didn't say that the actual premiums would be going up. What they said was they'd be going down by 14 percent to 20 percent. And I promise you, I've gone through this carefully with the Congressional Budget Office, and I'll be happy to present this to the press and whoever's listening because this is an important issue. Alexander later stood his ground, saying, With respect, you're wrong about -- your bill would increase premiums, I believe. You say it wouldn't. So rather than argue with you in public about it, I'd like to put my facts down, give them to you. I think it's a great idea, Obama said. I'd like to get this issue settled about whether premiums are reduced before we leave today, because I'm pretty certain I'm not wrong. This seemed like a good place for us to step in and referee. First, one of the key qualifiers that many people may have lost in this exchange is that they were debating the effects on premiums for people in the individual market. These are the people who do not get their insurance through an employer. This is only a fraction of the overall market. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that if the Democrats' plan were adopted, the individual market would grow to about 17 percent of the American population by 2016. The Democrats' plan calls for the creation of a health insurance exchange in which individuals could shop for insurance with private companies competing for their business. The idea is that it would allow individuals to purchase insurance at lower, group rates. Plans offered by companies participating in the exchange would have to meet government-mandated minimum coverage thresholds. The CBO estimated that the average premium for people in the individual market would be about 10 percent to 13 percent higher in 2016 than under current law. Specifically, the CBO estimates the average cost of family policies purchased by individuals would be $15,200 in 2016, as opposed to $13,100 under current law. That's the backing for Alexander's comment. But Obama correctly notes that much of the added cost is tied to people getting better insurance. The CBO said there are three drivers that would cause premiums to rise or fall. And it broke them down as follows: • Average premiums would be 27 percent to 30 percent higher because a greater amount of coverage would be obtained. In particular, the average insurance policy would cover a substantially larger share of enrollees costs for health care and a slightly wider range of benefits. Those expansions would reflect both the minimum level of coverage (and related requirements) specified in the proposal and peoples decisions to purchase more extensive coverage in response to subsidies. • Average premiums would be 7 percent to 10 percent lower because of a net reduction in costs to insurers, mostly from the changes in the rules governing the individual market. • Average premiums would be 7 percent to 10 percent lower because of a shift in the types of people obtaining coverage. Most of that change is tied to an influx of healthier people with below-average spending for health care, who would purchase coverage because of subsidies and a new tax penalty for failing to purchase insurance. Obama gets to his figure by combining those last two cost reductions, but not including the cost increase tied to people essentially getting better insurance. Both Obama and Alexander cited figures independent of the effect of subsidies. But we think it bears noting that under the Senate health plan, about 57 percent of people on the individual market would receive federal subsidies, and those subsidies would cover nearly two-thirds of the total premium. One last point, the Democrats' plan would allow people who currently have individual policies to grandfather in their existing policy. According to the CBO, the premiums for those policies would probably not differ substantially from current-law levels. In other words, if you were to opt to keep the exact same individual plan (an option the CBO doesn't believe many will take because, with subsidies, most could get a better plan cheaper), the CBO doesn't see the cost rising or falling substantially. And again, we are talking here only about premiums for people in the individual market. For most people, who get their insurance through their company, the CBO projects premiums to decline slightly from where they'd go if no health plan is passed. How slightly? In the 0 to 3 percent range, depending on whether you work at a large or small company. We think both Obama and Alexander have selectively chosen from the CBO report to suit their needs. Alexander insists the cost of premiums in the individual market will go up, without acknowledging that that's because most people will be getting better insurance coverage, either because of new government-mandated minimum coverage levels or because many will decide that subsidies will make upgrades to a better plan more cost-effective. Bottom line, people won't be paying more for the same thing. They'll be paying more for better plans. And on top of that, many will get federal subsidies, so they won't be paying the increased cost out of their own pockets. But we also think Obama has put on blinders when citing the CBO report. Yes, the CBO estimated 14 to 20 percent savings due to rule changes in the individual market, and because the plan is expected to infuse a large number of low-risk people into the insurance pool. But he ignores the estimated cost increases tied to more people getting better insurance. Obama tries to gloss over this by comparing costs for the same type of coverage that they're currently receiving. But the fact is, most would not be getting the same kind of coverage. Some of the shift to better coverage would be due to personal choice -- with subsidies, many people would be able to get better coverage at the same cost or cheaper -- but some would be tied to new government-mandated minimum coverage and the threat of tax penalties if you decide not to get insurance. And for those who opt to grandfather in their current individual policies (even if they don't meet the new government minimum standards), the CBO doesn't see much of a change in premiums one way or the other. And so we rule Obama's statement Half True."
6541,half-true,Jim Sullivan,"Says Leah Vukmir supports allowing people to carry concealed weapons into day care centers, churches, health care clinics and playgrounds.","In his 2010 bid for re-election to the Wisconsin state Senate, Jim Sullivan, D-Wauwatosa, is using a slogan that doesnt even mention his own name.Representative Leah Vukmir, he says in a series of direct-mail pieces to voters, shes just too extreme. At least five Sullivan mailers label Vukmir too extreme, on everything from health care for senior citizens to state funding for public safety to tracking sex offenders. A recent one focuses on guns, declaring:Vukmir supports allowing people to carry concealed weapons into day care centers, churches, health care clinics and playgrounds.When paired with an image of a handgun and bullets, and the suggestion there would be no limitations, thats a pretty strong statement.Would anyone have been able to carry a gun into all of those places?As evidence, Sullivans campaign points to a series of votes from Vukmir, a Wauwatosa Republican, in the state Assembly.The Vukmir votes were in support of Senate Bill 403, a measure introduced in 2005 that would have allowed individuals to apply for a license to carry concealed weapons. Applicants would have had to complete a firearms safety course or similar training. (At the time, only Wisconsin, Illinois and Nebraska did not have laws allowing concealed carry; today, only Wisconsin and Illinois dont permit it.)The bill, after being passed by both houses of the Legislature, was vetoed by Gov. Jim Doyle. The Senate voted to override the veto, but an override vote in the Assembly failed. Vukmir voted for the bill and to override Doyles veto.Lets look at each of the places Sullivan cites and what the bill said about them:Churches and health care clinics: The owner or authorized representative of a church or clinic could have given permission to a person who has a concealed carry license to bring a concealed weapon inside.Day care centers: Concealed carry would have been allowed only for the owner of a day care facility and, for day cares operated out of a home, the residents of the home.Playgrounds: Concealed carry would have been allowed at parks and playgrounds.That means of the four places cited by Sullivan, Vukmir supported allowing a limited number of people into three of the them. In some cases, such as a church or health care center, the pastor or operator would have been able to bar concealed weapons from the building. Only with playgrounds would Vukmir have allowed a wider group -- those who completed training and had received a permit.So lets take stock.In a campaign flier, Sullivan says Vukmir, supports allowing people to carry concealed weapons into day cares, churches and other places. As stated, Sullivan suggests Vukmir wants to allow most anyone to do so. In reality, the bill in question would have been limited to those who obtained permits and -- in three of the four public places described -- applied to a very limited number of people. That is an important detail left out."
21071,true,Barack Obama,There is more oil produced at home than we buy from the rest of the world – the first time thats happened in nearly 20 years.,"In his State of the Union address, President Barack Obama noted the countrys progress toward energy independence. There is more oil produced at home than we buy from the rest of the world – the first time thats happened in nearly 20 years, he said. Later in the speech, he added, The all-of-the-above energy strategy I announced a few years ago is working, and today, America is closer to energy independence than weve been in decades. Earlier in January, we fact-checked Obamas same claim about domestic oil production after he spoke at North Carolina State University.S. oil numbers. Heres what we had found: A White House spokesman offered up this White House blog post that explained Obamas point in more detail. According to the White House, Domestic crude oil production surpassed crude oil imports in October 2013 for the first time since 1995. We also consulted the U.S. Energy Information Administration. According to their November 2013 report, the United States produced an average of 7.8 million barrels of oil per day in October and imported 7.5 million barrels of oil per day. So Obamas numbers add up. How did we arrive at this point? Kenneth Medlock, an economics professor at Rice University who serves as the senior director for the Center for Energy Studies, said there are a couple of reasons why production exceeds imports. Yes, we are producing more than we import now, but that owes to both increased production domestically and reduced demand,Medlock said. The reduced demand is due in part to the recession. Its no surprise that people cut back on gasoline consumption when theres less money in their wallets, so that lowers demand. And if demand is down, the United States doesnt need to import as much oil supply. Another cause of reduced demand is increased energy efficiency. Over the last few years, rising popularity of fuel-efficient vehicles and other innovations have led consumers and businesses to spend less on utilities and at the pump, said John Lowe, a senior associate dean and energy law professor at Southern Methodist University. Aside from reduced demand, Medlock also mentioned increased production as another reason the United States is producing more oil than it's importing. We can credit increased domestic production to innovation in regulatory infrastructure. That includes factors like the ability for companies to negotiate directly with private landowners about mineral rights, as well as open access to pipelines. But we cant tie these developments back to one president, Medlock said. They go back a couple of decades. Still, its worth noting that Obama is a known supporter of energy efficiency. When he campaigned for office, he promised to reduce the countrys dependency on foreign oil. Our ruling Obama said the United States is producing more oil at home than its buying from the rest of the world for the first time in nearly two decades. That claim is on the money. However, a lot of this has been in the works for awhile, including dynamics that pre-date the Obama administration. Experts told us the new dynamic is due to factors like the recession, increased fuel efficiency and ramped up domestic oil production. As a simple statement on where we stand on oil exports vs. imports, though, Obamas claim is accurate."
904,mostly-true,Bryce Reeves,"If youre a single mom, and youve two kids in the city of Richmond, you can almost make $50,000 a year on the public dole.","State Sen. Bryce Reeves is running in a crowded Republican primary field for lieutenant governor on a small-government platform. My goal, as lieutenant governor, is to reform taxes, help to get people off of welfare, Reeves, R-Spotsylvania, said on The John Fredericks Show radio program. If youre a single mom and you have two kids in the city of Richmond, you can almost make $50,000 a year on the public dole. We wondered whether that single mom in Richmond really could receive so much public assistance. Reeves claim is based on a report by the Virginia Department of Social Services that examines the road to self-sufficiency taken by a fictitious Richmond mom with two boys, ages 3 and 7, as she gradually works toward a higher income level where she can pay completely for her familys basic needs without relying on public assistance. She starts out working 40 hours a week at a minimum-wage job, earning $15,080 a year. The Department of Social Services provided us a chart showing the public assistance shed receive at that wage level for a year: •Welfare, $3,840 •Food stamps, $2,268 •Women Infants and Children food basket, $600 •Child care assistance, $12,468 •School lunch, $1,296 •Housing voucher, $10,692 All of that assistance comes to $31,164 a year. That doesnt include the value of medical benefits the three-person family would get. Necole Simmonds, a Department of Social Services spokeswoman, told us in an email that the mom might be eligible for Medicaid while her children would be eligible for FAMIS Plus, a medical insurance program for children in low-income families. We asked about the cost of providing the fictitious Richmond family with medical insurance. Simmonds pointed us to estimates by the Kaiser Family Foundation of per-capita Medicaid spending in Virginia in 2011 - the latest year available. It came to $4,411 for an adult and $2,698 per child. These are not ideal figures because theyre bit old and, as we noted, the kids would be insured by FAMIS Plus, not Medicaid. The Department of Social Services couldnt provide an estimate on per-capita benefits from FAMIS Plus. Despite these issues, the figures provide an approximation of the cost of publicly funded medical services for the fictitious family. And when we add the medical costs to the other benefits listed above, the family would be receiving close to $40,000 in total public assistance - short of the figure Reeves cited. Simmonds told us in an email that the total value of the benefits a woman with two young kids making minimum wage may receive does not add up to $50,000. When we reached out to Reeves campaign, a spokeswoman told us the senator misspoke and said Reeves was not trying to suggest that the single mom would be getting nearly $50,000 from the public dole. What he was trying to say was: If youre a single mom, and youve two kids in the city of Richmond, you almost have to make $50,000 a year to get off the public dole, Sam Azzarelli, communications director for the Reeves campaign, wrote us in an email. There are some problems with this amended claim that we also should point out, even though its not the focus of this fact-check. The fictitious mother loses most of her public assistance by the time shes earning $33,800. At that point she no longer qualifies for welfare, food stamps, child care and housing assistance. As a result, shes left with an income that leaves her hundreds of dollars short each month of meeting her familys basic needs. The only major benefit her family continues to get is medical assistance for her two children, and that ends when her income reaches $42,120. But the family is not self-sufficient at this point and wont be, according to the Department of Social Services report, until the mother is earning $50,440. At that earning level, the mother is able to pay all of the basic expenses of housing, food, child care, health care and transportation. Our ruling Reeves said, If youre a single mom, and youve two kids in the city of Richmond, you can almost make $50,000 a year on the public dole. Although Reeves acknowledges he misspoke, he wasnt far off. That mother, if she was working full time at minimum wage, could receive about $40,000 a year in public assistance."
16165,true,Barack Obama,FDR was called a socialist and a communist.,"Sound familiar? The president was accused of being a socialist, not a Democrat. His plan was described as undisguised state socialism. One critic, who controlled some powerful media outlets, suggested that communists had infiltrated the president's administration. Those are some of the attacks that Franklin Delano Roosevelt faced in the 1930s — attacks cited recently by President Barack Obama to emphasize that he's not unique. Obama has mentioned the Roosevelt comparison several times recently, including during an interview onLate Night with David Lettermanon Sept. 21, 2009: What's happened is that whenever a president tries to bring about significant changes, particularly during times of economic unease, then there is a certain segment of the population that gets very riled up, Obama said. FDR was called a socialist and a communist. Indeed, Roosevelt was called a socialist or a communist many times. Most of that criticism came in the 1930s, when he was enacting programs intended to pull the country out of the Great Depression. • Roosevelt is a socialist, not a Democrat, declared Republican Rep. Robert Rich of Pennsylvania during a debate on the House floor on July 23, 1935. That remark came after Republicans hinted they were considering a move to impeach Roosevelt, according to theNew York Times. • The New Deal is now undisguised state socialism, declared Senator Simeon D. Fess (R-Ohio) today as he pictured President Roosevelt as the New Deal's leading socialist, reported theChicago Daily Tribuneon Aug. 7, 1934. The president's recent statements, Fess said, remove any doubt of his policy of state socialism, which necessitates increased activities of the government in either ownership or operation of industry, or both. • The Russian newspapers during the last election [1932] published the photograph of Franklin D. Roosevelt over the caption, 'The first communistic President of the United States,' said Sen. Thomas Schall, a Republican from Minnesota. Evidently the Russian newspapers had knowledge concerning the ultimate intent of the President, which had been carefully withheld from the voters in this country. In fact, the voters of the United States were meticulously misled as to such intentions. We found Schall's comments in the book,All But the People: Franklin D. Roosevelt and his Critics, 1933-1939. And then there's FDR being called a socialist by William Randolph Hearst. Hearst, a newspaper mogul, initially supported Roosevelt. But he gradually became disillusioned with the new president's policies. He especially hated Roosevelt's plan to increase taxes on the wealthy, and his papers routinely referred to the New Deal as the Raw Deal. By 1936, when Roosevelt was running for re-election, Hearst decided to support Republican Alf Landon and oppose Roosevelt with all the power of the press he could muster. Historian Ben Procter summarized this moment in history in his bookWilliam Randolph Hearst: The Later Years, 1911-1951: On September 6, Hearst newspapers began a prolonged assault on the administration. TheNew York Americanpublished a front-page editorial titled, 'The Radical Brand on the New Deal.' It charged that radical and communist leaders had already given their approval to support Roosevelt against Landon. During the next two weeks Hearst editors trumpeted these recurring themes: that communists had infiltrated the New Deal; that communism was un-American and undemocratic; that 'America can only judge Mr. Roosevelt and his administration by the strange silence that has prevailed in official quarters.' That was as much as Roosevelt was willing to take. The White House issued a statement that mentioned a certain notorious newspaper owner, and rebutted the accusations. The statement concluded, The American people will not permit their attention to be diverted from real issues to fake issues which no patriotic, honorable, decent citizen would purposefully inject into American affairs. Hearst shot back in a front-page editorial, which he signed personally. Let me say that I have not stated at any time whether the President willingly or unwillingly received the support of the Karl Marx Socialists, the Frankfurter radicals, communists and anarchists, the Tugwell bolsheviks, and the Richberg revolutionists which constitute the bulk of his following, Hearst wrote. I have simply said and shown that he does receive the support of these enemies of the American system of government, and that he has done his best to deserve the support of all such disturbing and destructive elements. Hearst's efforts were for naught. Roosevelt won the 1936 election in a landslide, while the Hearst newspaper chain slid into bankruptcy. There's not much controversy on this one, but it did provide an interesting opportunity to review American history."
6483,mostly-true,Glenn Greenwald,"Under the Espionage Act, (Edward Snowden would not be) allowed to come into court and say I was justified in disclosing this information. There is no whistleblower exception in the Espionage Act.","Edward Snowden, the former National Security Agency contractor who revealed the reach of American intelligence into the private lives of its citizens, is approaching a legal turning point. He is at the midpoint in his one-year asylum granted by Russia. What lies beyond is uncharted territory. The New York Times editorial board said the government should grant Snowden clemency and a plea arrangement that contains a limited punishment. Others, including White House National Security Adviser Susan Rice, have said Snowden should return without conditions and have his day in court. In the view of Glenn Greenwald, the investigative journalist who was one of the first to gain access to Snowdens stolen documents, a fair trial is the last thing that awaits the whistleblower if he comes back without a deal. Under the Espionage Act, you're not allowed to come into court and say I was justified in disclosing this information, Greenwald said on CNNs The Lead. There is no whistleblower exception in the Espionage Act. Greenwalds debate with Ruth Marcus of the Washington Postmade for good television. But we wanted to dig deeper into Greenwalds point about Snowden. There are two pieces to this puzzle. What does the law say and could Snowden reasonably expect to tell his side of the story in a trial? Limited protections for the intelligence community The Espionage Act of 1917 makes it a crime punishable by death or imprisonment to share information relating to the national defense with anyone who might want to do harm to the United States. Snowden faces two counts of unauthorized communication under that law. The Espionage Act contains no explicit whistleblower protection, said Bob Turner, a national security expert at the University of Virginia who has been critical of Greenwald and thinks Snowden should face the death penalty. However, Turned noted that while the 1917 law is silent, a law passed in 1998, the Intelligence Community Whistleblower Protection Act, does provide government workers with options. Under that law, Snowden could have raised his concerns with the Inspector Generals Office at the NSA or spoken to congressional intelligence committees. A separate federal law protects whistleblowers more generally but that only applies to sharing unclassified information, not the secret materials that Snowden had in hand. Had Mr. Snowden taken his information to the House or Senate intelligence committees, that would clearly not have violated the Espionage Act, Turner said. And if it did, his conduct would have been protected by the more recent 1998 whistleblower statute. But others familiar with this legal landscape told us that no matter what, Snowden was still vulnerable. The Intelligence Community Whistleblower Protection Act, for instance, does not prohibit agencies from retaliating against employees, said Elizabeth Goitein, co-director of the Brennan Centers Liberty and National Security Program at New York University School of Law. Goitein said President Barack Obama helped matters slightly when he issued a presidential order preventing retaliation against federal employees. But that order did not explicitly address the rights of contractors such as Snowden. And Goitein added, neither that directive nor the whistleblower law bars the government from criminally prosecuting whistleblowers. In 2010, NSA staffer Thomas Drake tried to use proper channels to report allegations of improper contracting but wound up the target of an investigation, said Kathleen McClellan, the national security and human rights counsel for the Government Accountability Project, a whistleblower advocacy group. Drake followed the Intelligence Community Whistleblower law to a T, McClellan said. He went to the Department of Defense inspector general and both congressional intelligence committees and it did not protect him from retaliation. In fact, it made him the target of an investigation. Federal agents wrongly went after Drake in pursuit of a separate matter and charged him with multiple felonies, according to a report from the Committee to Protect Journalists. When it became clear that whatever Drake had shared with the press was either not classified or already in the public domain, the governments felony case collapsed. A federal judge said it was unconscionable that Drake and his family had endured four years of hell. Restrictions within the courtroom Greenwald said Snowden would not be allowed to justify his actions in court. On this front, we cant offer a definitive assessment. We dont know what matters government prosecutors would permit into the courtroom, and we dont know how a judge would rule on the governments motions. However, recent trials under the Espionage Act make it clear that Snowden could expect no guarantee that he would be able to tell a jury why his violations might serve the countrys national interests. What he and his lawyers could present might be tightly constrained. The executive branch has asserted the sole authority to determine what remains a secret, McClellan said. The way these Espionage Act prosecutions have gone, it has not been fair to the defendants. It has not followed what you would expect in a traditional trial. Turner of the University of Virginia said he thinks public sympathy for Snowden is so broad, he might do fine with a jury. All he needs to walk free is a single juror who views him as a hero, Turner said. But whether any juror would hear a single reference to Snowdens claims to a higher purpose is also unclear. In 2012, a federal judge ruled that former CIA worker John Kiriakou could not present evidence about his reasons for going public with accounts of U.S. waterboarding during interrogations. Kiriakou was charged with disclosing classified information under the Espionage Act. Any claim that he acted with a salutary motive, or that he acted without a subversive motive, when he allegedly communicated NDI (national defense information) to journalists is not relevant to this case, the judge wrote. The trial of leaker Bradley (now Chelsea) Manning -- who gave troves of classified information to WikiLeaks -- followed similar lines, with the important difference that those proceedings took place in a military courtroom. Our ruling Greenwald said that if Snowden returned to the United States, he would have no protections under the Espionage Act and would not be allowed to justify his actions in court. In terms of the law, Greenwald is literally correct. Two other legal documents, however, could have provided Snowden some potential protections before he shared classified information with the press. But once he did, no law offers Snowden any shelter. Greenwalds further claim on what Snowden could say in his defense is less clear because it depends on what government prosecutors would do. We cant assess the accuracy of any statement about future outcomes. However, it is clear that there is ample precedent to show that Snowden would have no guaranteed opportunity to explain his motivations."
7678,false,Bloggers,12 more hurricanes headed towards U.S.,"A phony online news article that saysthe United States is expecting 12 more hurricanes was created as a prank on a site that allows people to generate fake news. Its claims were deemed absurd by the National Hurricane Center.  With a headline 12 More Hurricanes Headed Towards US, the post was published on react365.com and alleged to be sourced to the National Hurricane Center. The National Hurricane Center has issued 12 more hurricane warnings for the East Coast of the U.S., read the post, Regardless of which coast you live on, be prepared to evacuate at least 12 times, the National Weather Services said Thursday, not ruling out the possibility of a 13th hurricane by the end of the year. Despite the assumed validity of the sources, the entirety of this post is false. These so-called prank posts can leave users vulnerable to like-farming, where scammers use click-bait posts to get as many likes as possible and spread malware through popularly clicked links. We first saw the post on Sept. 21, 2017, but it appears to have been updated by the publisher to look more current. The content of the post hasnt changed. Since we first saw the post, there havebeen only three hurricanesin the Atlantic: Jose, Maria and Lee. Jose, which was quickly downgraded to a tropical storm when it came close to the East Coast, has fallen off the National Hurricane Center radar since Sept. 22. Maria has moved north off the shores of North Carolina and is predicted to move northeast, farther away from the East Coast. And Lee remains a idle swirl in the middle of the Atlantic with no apparent intent to touch American shores. The National Hurricane Center has yet to issue anything more severe than a tropical storm warning for any of these storms. Though the post is false, Dennis Feltgen of the National Hurricane Center advises people to stay vigilant during this active hurricane season. Since May, the National Weather Service has forecast that this years Atlantic hurricane season would be more active than past seasons. On Aug. 9, they updated their forecast, stating that this may be the most active hurricane season since 2010.  But, in the eyes of the National Hurricane Center, the react365.com claim is still nothing more than fake news and, according to Feltgen, totally unfounded, totally baseless and totally irresponsible"
17585,true,Dan Saltzman,Says the Portland Childrens Levy holds its administrative expenses to less than 5 percent.,"CORRECTION APPENDED: RACC has a 3 percent cap on programming at schools, not for arts grants administration. This does not change the ruling.  Advocates of new taxes for programs know that voters want the money to go to the people the tax is supposed to serve. So, when supporters of a tax levy for children pitched the program in 2002 and in 2008, they made sure to tell voters that administrative costs would be capped at 5 percent of all money received from an increase in property taxes.That means 95 percent of the money goes toward direct services for low-income and at-risk children, or at least, to the programs that serve those children.Portland City Commissioner Dan Saltzman made the same point on KGWs Straight Talk recently. (The statement is about 10 minutes into the interview.) The City Council has voted to put the property tax levy on the May 2013 ballot.In singing the levys praises, he said, And we hold our administrative expenses to less than 5 percent.We wanted to know if the figure is accurate, and if so, what that means. We noticed that the campaign pitching a Portland arts tax this fall also stated that administrative costs would be capped at 5 percent, after startup costs. So clearly its trendy number. (Jessica Jarratt Miller, executive director of the Creative Advocacy Network, said in an email that they borrowed the figure from the Portland Childrens Levy.)W e checked the annual audits of the Portland Childrens Levy and confirmed that levy administrators have consistently met the standard of keeping costs at or below 5 percent. For a sense of the dollars, the latest progress report shows that in 2010-11, the fund brought in $12.9 million, bringing the total available to $19.1 million. Of that, $560,000 was spent on administration. Thats 4.3 percent of $12.9 million. Now, we should point out that the administrative cap doesnt work on an annual basis, according to the levy. If fund administrators dont use up the entire 5 percent in one year, they can the following year. Which is why in fiscal year 2011-12, revenue was $10.8 million but administration expenses were $565,000, or 5.2 percent.Levy administrators look at the cumulative figure: Spokeswoman Mary Gay Broderick reports that from July 1, 2003, through June 30, 2012, total revenue was $95.7 million, with $4.5 million of the money spent on administration. That comes out to 4.7 percent. Grants totaled nearly $90.2 million.What is an administrative cost? Broderick explains they include all the costs associated with allocating, negotiating and monitoring grants. This includes salaries and benefits for staff, office lease, outside audit, computer costs, office supplies and general overhead, such as access to payroll and city attorney services. Other groups may define administrative costs differently.(The groups that receive grant money from the Childrens Levy use a different marker and the rates are negotiated separately. Generally, administration costs cannot exceed 15 percent of program expenses.)Finally, is a 5 percent cap a norm? We dont know, and neither does Saltzman. He does not recall how early advocates settled on the figure. I think the 5 percent came from my belief that we had a pretty high bar to gain public support for investing in kids, and they need to be assured that most of the dollars are going not for our administration but to the programs, he said.We hunted around for some context. The Portland Development Commission, which is the citys economic development arm, granted $158,000 last year as part of its Green Features Grant program. Total staff time to manage the program was $17,000. Thats about a 10 percent administrative rate. PDC granted $569,000 through its Community Livability Grant program, with $87,000 to administer the program. Thats about 13 percent of costs.The Oregon Department of Justice tracks charities and nonprofits in Oregon. Management expenses and fundraising made up of expenses in 16 percent in 2009 and 13 percent in 2010. So 5 percent spent on issuing and tracking grants sounds reasonable.Portlands Revenue Director Thomas Lannom said comparing administrative caps may not even be the most accurate way of gauging efficiency. An outfit like the Portland Childrens Levy needs little to no resources to collect revenue -- it comes out of property taxes -- while the new arts tax will require bodies to collect what is basically a head tax of $35 per adult worker.Lannom explained that voters authorized his office to spend up to 5 percent of revenue to collect the money. The Regional Arts and Culture Council has a separate 3 percent cap on coordination costs.PolitiFact Oregon cant judge what is the proper amount for administrative costs, but we can say that Saltzman is accurate when he says the Portland Childrens Levy holds its administrative expenses to less than 5 percent. The statement is True."
11269,mostly-false,Herman Cain,Muslims tried to use Sharia law to influence court decisions in New Jersey and Oklahoma,"Republican presidential candidate Herman Cain cant get away from the subject of Islamic law.Reporters have been dogging him on the issue since March, when a liberal blogger asked Cain whether hed feel comfortable appointing a Muslim to his Cabinet if he became president. Cain said he would not appoint one because Islam demands they follow Sharia law, above all others -- including the U.S. Constitution. Sharia law is a wide-ranging set of rules that govern aspects of Islamic life including religious practice, daily living, crime and financial dealings. Muslims differ on its interpretation. Later, Cain denied saying he would not appoint Muslims -- a statement PolitiFact Georgia ruled Pants on Fire. CNN anchor and moderator John King asked Cain about the subject again during the June 13 Republican primary debate in Manchester, N.H.Are American-Muslims as a group less committed to the Constitution than, say, Christians or Jews? King asked.There have been instances in New Jersey -- there was an instance in Oklahoma where Muslims did try to influence court decisions with Sharia law. I was simply saying very emphatically, American laws in American courts,  Cain replied.Have there been instances in New Jersey and Oklahoma where Muslims tried to influence court decisions with Sharia law?We turned to news accounts and court documents to address the issue.First, well consider Oklahoma, where voters approved the Save Our State Amendment Nov. 2. It forbids courts from using Sharia law as well as international law when they make decisions. A judge granted a request later that month for a preliminary injunction that bars the amendment from going into effect. It is being challenged in federal appellate court.During a Nov. 22 hearing in Oklahoma federal court, state Assistant Attorney General Scott Boughton defended the amendment on behalf of the state. He conceded under questioning by a federal judge that he did not know of any instances where Sharia law was used in state courts, according to The Oklahoman newspaper.An Oct. 28 Los Angeles Times article on the proposed amendment found three cases that backers said demonstrate Sharia law is being used in U.S. courts. None of them took place in Oklahoma.A brief filed in federal court in support of the Oklahoma amendment did not assert that Sharia law had been used in Oklahoma courts. Instead, it listed one example from New Jersey.This brings us to Cains mention of New Jersey during the June 13 debate. In 2009, state Superior Court Judge Joseph Charles denied a woman a restraining order after she reported her husband repeatedly beat and sexually assaulted her. She and her husband are Muslim.Charles asked their imam during the injunction hearing how Islamic law applies to sexual behavior. The imam testified that a wife must comply with her husbands sexual demands, but a husband was forbidden to approach his wife like any animal. Charles said he denied the restraining order in part because the husbands desire to have sex when and whether he wanted to, was something that was consistent with his practices and it was something that was not prohibited, according to the decision.The New Jersey appeals court ruled July 23, 2010, that Charles was wrong. His decision contradicted U.S. and state Supreme Court precedent on conflicts between criminal law and religion, the ruling said. Lets sum up.Cain was wrong on Oklahoma. Voters did pass an amendment to the state constitution that would prevent the use of Sharia law in state courts, but supporters found no instance where Muslims did try to influence court decisions with Sharia law, as Cain said.There was a New Jersey case in which a judge considered Islamic law when he denied a request for a restraining order.However, since the issue of Islamic law arose only when the New Jersey judge questioned the couples imam, it is unfair to accuse Muslims of trying to influence court decisions with Sharia law. The judge raised the subject.We rule Cains statement Barely True."
18981,mostly-false,Austin Independent School District,Austin ISD has the highest graduation rate of every major city in Texas.,"An ad posted in Austins Erwin Center during June 2016 high school graduation ceremonies made us wonder: Austin ISD has the highest graduation rate of every major city in Texas. That seemingly takes in a lot of school districts. Asked the basis of the message, a spokesman for the Austin school district, Reyne Telles, said by phone that marketing officials focused on 2014 graduation rates for signature districts in the states five most populous cities. For each district, Texas calculates one graduation rate by counting students in keeping with federal law and another rate that comports with state law. Upshot: The Austin districts 2014 graduation rate — 88.6 percent or 86.3 percent, depending on which result you choose — outpaced comparable rates for the Houston, San Antonio, Dallas and Fort Worth districts, Telles noted. The district emailed us a spreadsheet presenting its figures, which we checked against Texas Education Agency data confirming that among the five districts, Austin had the highest graduation rates--though it was close: The Dallas district had graduation rates of 86.9 or 86.1 percent, respectively, TEA posts indicate. Statewide, the agency in 2015 announced the 2014 state graduation rate was 88.3 percent, a record high. Texas High School Graduation Rates, Selected Districts, 2014 DISTRICT 2014 GRADUATION RATE USING FEDERAL STUDENT EXCLUSIONS 2014 GRADUATION RATE USING STATE STUDENT EXCLUSIONS Austin 86.3 percent 88.6 percent Dallas 86.1 86.9 Fort Worth 81.0 84.1 Houston 78.6 81.8 San Antonio 78.2 80.8 SOURCES: Online searches using website, Search Four-Year Graduation and Dropout Data by District, Class of 2014, Texas Education Agency (accessed June 6-7, 2016) Other slices of data We recognized other ways to compare the Austin district to other districts in major Texas cities. For instance, TEA classifies Austin and 10 other districts as major urban districts, meaning each one is located in a county with a population of at least 870,000; its enrollment is the largest in the county or at least 75 percent of the largest district enrollment in the county; and at least 35 percent of enrolled students are economically disadvantaged. The major urban districts include the districts AISD singled out for its ad plus the Arlington district in Tarrant County, the North East and Northside districts in San Antonio and several districts in El Paso County--El Paso, Socorro and Ysleta. And among these additional districts, per the state, the North East and Northside districts had the highest 2014 graduation rates (93.4 or 94.1 percent depending on the calculation). More than half the North East district lies within San Antonio, the district says, though it takes in smaller cities including Castle Hills. Northside describes itself as located in the northwest quadrant of San Antonio. The Socorro district, with 88.2 to 89.8 percent graduation rates, similarly fared better than the Austin district. The Socorro district says its serves students in East El Paso, the city of Socorro and Horizon City. You could also look at districts based on enrollment, an approach that arguably elevates a suburban Houston district, the 110,000-student Cypress-Fairbanks district, into consideration. Its graduation rates of 91.4 and 92.4 percent, respectively, outpaced the 80,000-student Austin districts rates. We ran these alternate comparisons past Telles, who said its always a challenge to convert educational speak and/or data into something digestible for the general public. Were dealing with marketers that tell us billboard advertising is kind of complicated when you go more than six words, Telles said. Telles said the district could have compared Austin with its fellow major urban districts. Then again, he said, if you say Northside, the average person, Id venture to say, would not know where that is. The ad statement, he said, came down to consumability. In a follow-up email, Telles noted that more than half the Austin districts student population is considered at risk of dropping out — which is also the case in the four districts it chose for the comparison. But that wasn't so, Telles wrote, for the Northside, North East or Socorro districts. In 2014, according to TEA data, 56 percent of Austin students were considered at risk. Half of Socorro students were at risk, the agency says, as were 43 percent of Northside students and 36 percent of North East students. Our ruling The Austin district says it has the highest graduation rate of every major city in Texas. This declaration is rooted in the faulty premise that Texas has only five major cities and only the districts named for those cities are worthy of comparison. Applying those filters gives the statement an element of truth. On the other hand, we identified other districts in the same cities with higher graduation rates than the Austin district. Were flipping the Truth-O-Meters tassel and rating this claim Mostly False. MOSTLY FALSE – The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.

5081,mostly-false,Lloyd Doggett,Our university campuses by federal law do not check the immigration status of their students just as our public schools dont.,"A Democrat said Texas universities rightly dont check on whether students are living in the country with legal authorization--in accord with federal law. U.S. Rep. Lloyd Doggett of Austin, whose district stretches south into San Antonio, was asked in a December 2016 interview with Austin's CBS Austin to talk about whether certain college students should be worried amid threats to take away federal funding from so-called sanctuary campuses, presumably a reference to colleges and universities whose leaders indicate no desire to help immigration authorities pursue students who lack legal U.S. residency. Doggett replied by initially calling sanctuary campuses a misnomer. The former Texas Supreme Court justice went on: Our university campuses by federal law do not check the immigration status of their students, just as our public schools dont. And thats the right thing to do. There is a Supreme Court decision about the right to public education. Doggett added that if theres a dangerous person on campus, law enforcement should honor any arrest warrant from immigration authorities to assure safety. A 1982 Supreme Court ruling held U.S. children to be entitled to kindergarten through grade 12 public schooling regardless of legal residency status. Yet that decision wasn't reflecting on university access. So Doggetts statement made us wonder how federal law keeps state universities from checking the immigration status of students. There isnt such a law, it appears. And when we asked which law Doggett was thinking of, Doggetts House chief of staff, Michael Mucchetti, said by email: His point is that current federal law doesnt even require universities to check. Mucchetti earlier noted that on Dec. 7, 2016, Denise Trauth, president of Texas State University, told faculty, staff and students in a Twitter post: The university, following current law, does not and will not report undocumented immigrants to authorities. We didn't read Trauth's statement as her saying the university doesnt check the immigration statuses of students. Beyond that, our requests that a university spokesman, Matt Flores, specify the law Trauth was talking about didnt immediately draw a reply. Board that oversees Texas colleges, universities Next, we asked the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board, which oversees colleges and universities statewide, about whether Texas universities check the citizenship status of students. In reply, Kelly Carper Polden emailed us a November 2016 agency overview of state laws that enable Texas residents lacking legal U.S. residency--either through citizenship or permanent resident/green card status--to attend public colleges at in-state tuition rates rather than more costly nonresident rates, provided the students have lived in Texas with a parent, guardian or conservator for 36 months up to high school graduation. Affidavit students in Texas The overview gives the impression that Texas universities routinely tally students who lack legal U.S. residency. That is, the publication says that each benefiting student must complete an affidavit stating his or her intent to apply for permanent resident status in the U.S. as soon as he/she meets federal eligibility requirements. Also, the publication states, each public institution of higher education is responsible for acquiring and maintaining, indefinitely or until the student becomes a Permanent Resident of the U.S., signed affidavits completed by non-U.S. citizens seeking Texas resident status for in-state tuition purposes. In addition, Coordinating Board rules require institutions to remind affidavit students each year of their obligation to apply for Permanent Resident status as soon as they are eligible to do so, the overview states. The same rules require the institutions to refer students to the appropriate federal agency for instructions on how to achieve Permanent Resident status, the overview says. Weve reported several times before on Texas affidavit students. Then-Gov. Rick Perrys approval of the 2001 legislation authorizing such college admissions drew fire when he ran for president in 2012. The 2016 overview states that in fiscal 2015, through August 2015, the states 24,982 affidavit students included 17,384 students in public community, technical and state colleges; 7,580 students in public universities; and 18 students in public health-related institutions, costing an estimated $23.42 million in state appropriations while the affidavit students paid $58.3 million in tuition and fees, the overview states. Subsequently, web searches led us to a sample universal application for students seeking to enroll at Texas A&M University in fall 2017 that asks if the applicant is a U.S. citizen or permanent resident or if the applicant fulfills state residency requirements related to fulfilling affidavit status. Also, to our inquiry, Polder pointed us to the states Core Residency Questions form last updated by the coordinating board in 2011; the form asks an applicant to attest to her or his U.S. citizenship or other residency status and includes this provision: I authorize the college/university to verify the information I have provided. National perspective Nationally in November 2016, more than 500 college and university presidents called for preserving and even expanding Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, a 2012 initiative by President Barack Obama that enabled young immigrants brought to the U.S. as children to go to college and seek work despite lacking legal authorization to live in the country. After spotting that call on the Pomona College website, we asked the colleges dean of students, Miriam Feldblum, whos also an immigration scholar, if Doggett was right about federal law and universities not checking the immigration status of students. By phone, Feldblum said thats certainly not so for international students, who must have visas to live and study in the U.S., and, she said, no federal law prohibits institutions from checking the immigration status of students. Regardless, she said, public colleges and universities focus for tuition purposes on whether applicants are state residents. Feldblum also stressed that federal privacy laws bar colleges and universities from unilaterally sharing the immigration status of a student absent the students consent or a compelling factor such as a subpoena. Right now, campuses are not sharing this information with anybody, Feldblum said. We have no obligation to do so. Doggett aide: Claim mischaracterized We filled in Mucchetti on our finding no federal law forbidding universities from checking a students residency status. We also shared the state-published overview for Texas affidavit students. By email, Mucchetti suggested we were mischaracterizing the congressmans statement. Doggett did not say that any federal law prohibits or bars universities from checking status. He was saying that educational institutions are not required by federal law to check status—that like our public schools, public universities, in accord with federal law, do not check, Mucchetti wrote. Our ruling Doggett said: Our university campuses by federal law do not check the immigration status of their students. We see an element of truth here in that colleges and universities, like public schools, dont act as immigration enforcement agents. But we didn't spot nor did Doggett identify a federal law that bars or excuses universities from checking the immigration statuses of students. Meantime, a state law leads public Texas institutions to tally affidavit students, each of whom has declared a lack of legal U.S. residency. Also, each student-applicant to those colleges and universities must answer questions about citizenship and legal residency and agree to have information verified. MOSTLY FALSE – The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.

7635,half-true,Barack Obama,If Senator Clinton or John McCain had stood up in previous years for increases in fuel efficiency standards . . . then we would not be in this same situation in the first place.,"Barack Obama has spent the past couple of weeks deriding Hillary Clinton and John McCain's support for a gas tax holiday during the summer driving season, branding it a gimmick that will both worsen the deficit and encourage more oil consumption. Now, he's suggesting both of his Senate colleagues were asleep at the wheel when they had a chance to do something meaningful about federal fuel economy standards. If Senator Clinton or John McCain had stood up in previous years for increases in fuel efficiency standards, in getting serious about an energy policy that is freeing ourselves from dependence on foreign oil, then we would not be in this same situation in the first place, Obama said during an interview on NBC's Meet The Press on May 4, 2008. Though Obama may be fond of scolding his senior colleagues, he's overlooking the fact that McCain played a significant role in trying to raise the Corporate Average Fuel Economy, or CAF, standards three years before Obama arrived in the Senate. In 2002, the Arizona senator worked with Democratic Sen. John Kerry of Massachusetts on a plan that would have raised the CAF standard for cars and light trucks to 36 miles per gallon by 2015. Their proposal, which would have been an amendment to President Bush's energy proposal, never came up for a vote because it was trumped by a competing amendment authored by Sens. Carl Levin, D-Mich., and Christopher S. Bond, R-Mo., that was backed by the auto industry and merely set a deadline to come up with fuel efficiency standards. It would turn out to be McCain's high-water mark advocating for greater fuel economy. He was much less prominent on the issue during the 2005 debate that yielded a comprehensive energy bill (though he did mount an unsuccessful effort with Sen. Joseph I. Lieberman, D-Conn., to cap greenhouse gas emissions at 2000 levels) and did not vote at all on Senate passage of a 2007 energy package that set the first statutory increase in vehicle fuel-economy standards in 32 years. Clinton and Obama both voted for the Senate bill. Obama's slap at Clinton's record is perhaps a bit more defensible. During a 2005 energy debate, she voted against an amendment by Obama's Illinois colleague, Democratic Sen. Richard J. Durbin, that would have mandated increases in CAF standards for passenger vehicles, up to an average of 27.5 miles per gallon by 2016. Obama supported the amendment. Clinton was among 19 of the 41 Democrats voting who opposed Durbin's proposal, influenced in part by a Bush administration threat to veto any bill that set specific new standards. It's worth noting that while rising gas prices were a concern back then, the most contentious issues that year were unsuccessful administration efforts to drill for oil and natural gas in the Arctic and separate successful efforts by majority Republicans to shield manufacturers of the fuel additive methyl tertiary butyl ether (MTBE) from product liability suits surrounding groundwater contamination. While fuel economy certainly makes for a potent campaign issue at a time when gas prices are surpassing $3.50 a gallon, Obama and Clinton have been apart on other aspects of energy policy. Obama has been an enthusiastic supporter of federal mandates promoting greater use of ethanol and other biofuels, largely because they benefit agricultural interests in his state. Clinton – and McCain, for that matter – have been more skeptical about having the government promote one fuel over another, especially if it's too costly to compete without government help. During another energy debate, in June 2003, Clinton supported a pair of amendments to weaken federal ethanol mandates. However, majorities in both houses supported the alternative fuel, and wound up mandating greatly expanded usage in both the 2005 and 2007 energy laws. Obama's criticism is right on Clinton, but wrong on McCain. Because Obama neglects to recognize McCain's prominent role in a bipartisan effort to legislate increases in federal fuel-economy standards and depicts him as less-than-serious player on the issue, we rule his statement: Half True.

19422,true,Rob Portman,$16 trillion (the national debt) in $1 bills would cover the entire state of Ohio nearly 1.5 times.,"The U.S. government has carried debt since 1790, according to the Treasury Department, but the national debt didn't top $1 trillion until 1982.When it hit $16 trillion for the first time on Sept. 4, 2012, Sen. Rob Portman called it a dangerous milestone and troubling evidence that our nation is headed in the wrong direction.In an attempt to put $16 trillion in terms everyday people can get their arms around, he also released a list of items showing how that much money stacks up -- such as $16 trillion in $1 bills would cover the entire state of Ohio nearly 1.5 times.Sixteen trillion is a lot of kapusta -- but is it enough to carpet the countryside and turn Ohio green? Just for fun, PolitiFact Ohio decided to survey the landscapeWe got data from Portman staff's and checked the math. Heres how it works out. That would cover Ohio's total area of 44,825 square miles 1.42 times -- or nearly 1.5 times. We ran the numbers again, using the land area of 40,860 square miles that the federal Census Bureau gives Ohio. Sixteen trillion singles would cover that area almost exactly 1.5 times.On the Truth-O-Meter, Portman's statement rates True."
20606,mostly-false,Crossroads GPS,"While Arkansas seniors depend on Social Security and Medicare, Sen. Mark Pryor supports an overhaul so they couldnt get Social Security until they turn 68 or 69.","The idea of raising the retirement age is popping up in one of the nations hottest Senate races -- and not in a positive way. Crossroads GPS, a Republican-aligned group, has launched a television ad in the race between incumbent Sen. Mark Pryor, D-Ark., and his Republican challenger, Rep. Tom Cotton. A portion of the ad says, Arkansas seniors depend on Social Security and Medicare. Its troubling that Sen. Mark Pryor said we should overhaul Social Security and Medicare. On Social Security, Pryor suggested raising the retirement age. The ad then cuts to a 2011 interview of Pryor saying, ... say that they couldnt get Social Security until they turn 68 or 69. Greg Sargent, author of the Washington Posts liberal Plum Line blog, noticed the truncated sentence in the video clip, which suggested the ads creators had removed some context from the interview with Pryor.Sargent flagged this to PolitiFact in a tweet, and we thought it deserved a look. The interview excerpted in the ad was conducted by Jerry Westmoreland of KTSS-TV, an Ion Television affiliate based in Bill Clintons birthplace of Hope, Ark. In the interview, Pryor was talking about some of the long-term funding challenges Social Security faces: Social Security is another thing thats not in any of the budgets right now, but it is very, very fixable. And again, if people get serious about this in Washington, we can fix Social Security next week if we wanted to. It's not that hard to do, especially if we start right now, because Social Security is solvent for about 25 years. So if you make small changes now, you have 25 years for those little changes to accumulate over time and really help. You could pretty easily make Social Security solvent in perpetuity. Probably the biggest change would be to take my kids generation -- teenagers today -- and life expectancy is longer etc., and probably say that they couldnt get Social Security until they turn 68 or 69. If you just did that one change, youd fix about 80 percent of it. The Pryor campaign, in a written response to the ad, said that the senator has never voted to raise the Social Security retirement age, and even in the context of the interview, he doesnt say that a retirement-age hike is his official policy stance. We found no evidence to contradict those assertions by the Pryor campaign -- but its important to note that the ad didnt make either of those claims. It simply said that Pryor suggested raising the retirement age. Because the full KTSS interview makes that much clear, the ad does contains a grain of truth. However, the Crossroads GPS ad glosses over -- indeed, actively edits away -- some important context. Specifically, in the KTSS interview, Pryor limits his suggestion to raising the retirement age for his kids generation -- teenagers today. For an ad whose narration directly addresses Arkansas seniors -- and that only includes images of seniors, without showing any teenagers -- thats a crucial omission. Crossroads GPS did not respond to an inquiry for this article. Our ruling The Crossroads GPS ad said that while Arkansas seniors depend on Social Security and Medicare, Pryor supports an overhaul by which they couldnt get Social Security until they turn 68 or 69. The ad has a point that Pryor suggested raising the retirement age in the KTSS interview. However, the ad is explicitly directed toward Arkansas seniors, and through selective editing of the KTSS interview, Crossroads GPS omits a clear and important qualifier Pryor had made, that any future hike in the retirement age would be for his kids generation -- teenagers today."
18439,false,Donald Trump,"Our doctors get more money if somebody dies from COVID.  So what they do is they say, I'm sorry, but, you know, everybody dies of COVID.","A few weeks ago, President Donald Trump had praise for doctors on the frontlines of treating coronavirus patients. Since the plague arrived from China, we have seen our doctors, nurses, first responders, scientists, and researchers at their very best, he said Sept. 24. Trump has changed his tune. In his recent rallies, with COVID-19 cases skyrocketing and deaths climbing, he has taken to accusing physicians of inflating deaths to line their pockets. Our doctors get more money if somebody dies from COVID, he told supporters at a rally in Waterford, Mich., Oct. 30. You know that, right? I mean, our doctors are very smart people. So what they do is they say, I'm sorry, but, you know, everybody dies of COVID. This is a persistent theory that lacks any proof. Johns Hopkins University researchers reported that the virus has killed more than 230,000 people. There is no evidence that figure is exaggerated. If anything, public health analysts say it likely undercounts the reach of the disease. And while the government offers 20% more for the care of Medicare patients with COVID-19, the majority of doctors work for hospital systems. That means whatever higher payments might come, they don't go to them. In order for Trumps claim to have an appreciable impact on reported deaths, thousands of doctors would need to lie on death certificates without any financial benefit. We recently rated False a similar claim from Trump that focused on hospitals. Trumps words imply that death certificates are subject to the whim of physicians. Thats wrong, and heres why. Ashish K. Jha, dean of Brown Universitys School of Public Health, noted there are legal sanctions for falsifying death records. Doctors aren't taking random deaths and calling them COVID deaths, Jha wrote Oct. 27 in the website MedScape. That would be fraud. Jha also dismissed the impact of additional payments. He gave the example of a patient who spends more than four days on a ventilator. Without COVID, Medicare pays about $35,000 for that patient's care, Jha wrote. With COVID, about $40,000. In a tweet, Jha noted that to get this bump, the hospital must prove that the patient tested positive for COVID-19. So what happened in COVID era?Cares Act gives hospitals a 20% bump (to about $9600 – 13K) if pneumonia is from COVIDAdditional $1600 - $2200 for a typical COVID pneumonia patientTo get this bump, hospitals must document that patient is COVID positive3/n For the first time ever, in 2018, the number of doctors working for hospitals exceeded those who worked in independent practices. This means that the additional payments Trump referenced dont apply to most doctors. A COVID-19 diagnosis doesnt change what they charge. Hospitals are paid that way, not doctors, said Maggie McGillick, spokeswoman for the American College of Emergency Physicians. Doctors are typically paid based on the service they deliver. The majority of deaths take place in hospitals and nursing homes. Trumps statement would mean that doctors who stand to make no financial gain would put themselves at legal risk by falsifying a death record. Decisions on how to classify a given death are made by local doctors or coroners, but they are based on World Health Organization guidelines followed by the U.S. and nearly every other country. The approach to identifying an underlying cause is laid out by the World Health Organization, which says a death due to COVID-19 is defined for surveillance purposes as a death resulting from a clinically compatible illness, in a probable or confirmed COVID-19 case, unless there is a clear alternative cause of death that cannot be related to COVID disease (e.g. trauma). The CDC reported that as of early October, the U.S. had about 300,000 more deaths in 2020 than would be expected in a typical year, two-thirds of which can be attributed directly to COVID-19. The data snapshot was based on Oct. 3 figures. That would put the death toll at 200,000, which was very close to the number reported by another regular source, the COVID Tracking Project. But the CDC went further. As of Oct. 15, 216,025 deaths from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have been reported in the United States, the report said. However, this number might underestimate the total impact of the pandemic on mortality. This is consistent with other studies that show no overcount of deaths from the virus. Individually and collectively, doctors have rejected Trumps claim. Philadelphia physician Dr. Priya Mammen tweeted that many frontline workers are buying their own personal protective equipment because hospitals dont have enough. Mammen said many of her colleagues are exhausted by saving lives of preventable COVID. The American College of Emergency Physicians said Trumps implication that doctors seek to gain financially is offensive. Emergency physicians and other health care workers have risked their lives day in and day out for almost a year battling the greatest public health crisis in a generation — all while watching countless patients die alone, going to work without sufficient protection equipment, and struggling with crushing anxiety about getting sick or spreading the virus to their loved ones, the group said Oct. 25. We reached out to the Trump campaign for evidence that doctors are inflating the death figures. We did not hear back. Trump said that doctors inflate the number of COVID-19 deaths to get more money. ... So what they do is they say, I'm sorry, but, you know, everybody dies of COVID. There is no evidence to back this up. Doctors and coroners follow established guidelines on the cause of death, and false reporting is a crime. A plurality of doctors work for hospitals and have no financial incentive to falsify death records. Medicare does pay more for COVID-19 patients, but hospitals must prove a positive diagnosis for the disease. A CDC analysis, in line with other research, finds the reported deaths from COVID-19 likely underestimate deaths from the virus."
1161,true,Roger Williams,Says he's signed a pledge not to raise taxes four times.,"U.S. Senate hopeful Roger Williams stressed his opposition to higher taxes during a June 8 candidate forum presented by the Texas Tribune and KLRU-TV, saying: I've signed that pledge four times. The idea of raising taxes any time, but certainly at a time of economic slowdown, is nuts.Williams, a Republican, is making his first bid for elected office, so his comment seemed a head-scratcher. How many no-tax pledges can one candidate sign?On behalf of Williams, campaign spokesman Colby Hale told us Williams has twice signed no-tax pledges from Americans for Tax Reform, has signed the American Family Business Institute no death tax pledge and, Hale said he believes, a few different Tea Party (no-tax) pledges at various rallies. Hale said he thinks Williams also signed a No Climate Tax pledge for Americans for Prosperity.We checked his list.By email, Patrick Gleason of Washington-based Americans for Tax Reform said Williams signed its pledge Feb. 9 and once before then. The pledge says the individual will oppose any and all efforts to increase the marginal income tax rates for individuals and/or businesses and also will oppose any net reduction or elimination of deductions and credits, unless matched dollar for dollar by further reducing tax rates.The American Family Business Institute forwarded a copy of the Death Tax Repeal Pledge signed by Williams May 10. It states the signers will support the permanent repeal of the federal estate and gift taxes. Spokesman Adam Nicholson said by email that Williams also signed the pledge earlier because the group asks candidates to sign for each election cycle. Last year, Williams was among candidates geared up to run for U.S. Senator Kay Bailey Hutchisons seat when she said she was considering stepping down to run for governor.Later, Williams campaign forwarded a copy of the no-climate tax pledge -- avowing opposition to any climate-change legislation that includes a net increase in government revenue -- signed by Williams on Feb. 14.So, Williams has signed at least three anti-tax pledges--two of them twice."
16960,mostly-true,Republican Jewish Coalition,Barack Obama refuses to acknowledge Jerusalem as the capital of Israel.,"Editor's note: This item was originally rated Half True. After a panel of editors reconsidered the rating, it was upgraded to Mostly True. The Republican Jewish Coalition -- a group backed by the casino magnate Sheldon Adelson and a few other wealthy GOP donors -- has opened a campaign in battleground states to persuade Jewish voters to turn away from President Obama and support Mitt Romney.The group said its effort, called My Buyers Remorse, includes a $5 million television ad buy in Ohio (specifically Cleveland), South Florida, Pennsylvania (Philadelphia) and Nevada (Las Vegas) that will continue through Nov. 5.It also includes a direct-mail brochure to voters saying Obama is wrong on Israel, wrong on our economy.First among the statements answering its question Why is Barack Obama wrong for us? is that he refuses to acknowledge Jerusalem as the capital of Israel.Given that the flier is showing up mailboxes in the battleground Buckeye State, PolitiFact Ohio thought it was worth looking into the coalitions claim.Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney made a similar claim in a 30-second TV ad that aired in early August 2012. PolitiFact national looked at his claim then. Weve incorporated some of that research here.The United States does not formally recognize any state as having sovereignty over Jerusalem. In the decades-long conflict between Jews and Palestinians, both sides stake a claim on Jerusalem and consider it their capital and a holy site. So even though Jerusalem is the Israeli seat of government and its capital city in every traditional sense, the official position often involves some tip-toeing.The CIA, on its World Factbook website, lists Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, with a footnote stating Israel proclaimed Jerusalem as its capital in 1950, but the U.S., like all other countries, maintains its Embassy in Tel Aviv. The U.S. Department of State posts similar language.During the 2008 campaign, candidate Obama declared that Jerusalem will remain the capital of Israel, and it must remain undivided.The remark pleased the pro-Israel lobby, which had been somewhat skeptical of him. But it also served as an early lesson in the delicacy of diplomacy, particularly when it comes to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Arab groups took offense, and the campaign had to do some damage control. It's going to be up to the parties to negotiate a range of these issues. And Jerusalem will be part of those negotiations, Obama said in the wake.For his part, Republican rival John McCain weighed in, agreeing Jerusalem is undivided. Jerusalem is the capital.And, he added, according to the New York Times, we should move our embassy to Jerusalem, from Tel Aviv, before anything else happens. The subject of Jerusalem itself will be addressed in negotiations by the Israeli government and people.Therein lies a long-running point of contention: the location of the U.S. embassy.As our peers at the Washington Posts Fact Checker column noted, the Republican Party platform has long included a pledge to move the embassy to Jerusalem. But thats never happened, even when a Republican was in the White House.How wide is the gap between campaign rhetoric and official policy? During a press briefing on July 26, 2012, White House spokesman Jay Carney twice dodged the question when asked directly to name the capital of Israel.He replied only that our position hasnt changed and you know the answer.State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland parried similarly at a briefing on March 29, 2012.Jerusalem is a permanent-status issue, she said. Its got to be resolved through negotiations.Those briefings are the evidence the Republican Jewish Coalition pointed to when PolitiFact Ohio asked for backup to its brochure. Romneys campaign cited the Carney briefing.The claim in the RJC brochure is accurate. Obama has not formally acknowledged Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. But the claim needs additional information for clarification.As a candidate, Obama identified Jerusalem as Israels capital. But as president since then, he has shied away from making statements that could be perceived as taking sides in the ongoing peace process.TheRJC'sbrochure portrays that position as a betrayal of an ally. But it's acontinuation of the position that previous presidents, both Democrat and Republican, have taken.Formally, the United States does not recognize any state as having sovereignty over Jerusalem. Both the state department and CIA note that Jerusalem as Israels capital, with a footnote attached, on their websites.On the Truth-O-Meter, the claim rates Mostly True."
5504,mostly-false,Ted Strickland,"With 320,000 net Ohio manufacturing jobs lost, (Sen. Rob) Portman calls NAFTA a proven success.","Ohio voters may have a sense of deja vu with some of the talking points rolled out by Ohio Senate candidate Ted Strickland. Strickland, the former Democratic governor, is again knocking opponents over job losses from the North American Free Trade Agreement. In aFacebook postabout skewed priorities, Strickland attacks Ohio Sen. Rob Portman, a Republican, for embracing the agreement as U.S. trade representative under President George W. Bush while criticizing the auto bailout. With 320,000 net Ohio manufacturing jobs lost, Portman calls NAFTA a proven success,  the post says. With 160,000 auto jobs saved, Portman called the auto rescue a lousy deal.   The attack about lost jobs from NAFTA sounded a lot likean attack PolitiFact Ohiochecked out in the 2010 governors race against Republican John Kasich. Stricklands campaign blamed NAFTA for a loss of 49,000 jobs to Mexico and 91,000 to China. (Kasich, of course, won the gubernatorial election and is now running for president. And Stricklands claim ratedFalse.) We wanted to know if NAFTA really killed a net 320,000 Ohio manufacturing jobs. NAFTA took effect Jan. 1, 1994, with the intent to smooth importing and exporting between Canada, the United States and Mexico. The deal is a big issue in Ohio, home to unions that are typically among NAFTAs fiercest critics. Unions argue that trade deals like NAFTA send American jobs overseas. Portman indeed called NAFTA a proven success when he was the U.S. trade representative under President George W. Bush in a 2006 newsrelease. The news release didnt say anything about lost jobs, though, so we kept digging.  Strickland campaign spokesman David Bergstein confirmed that they sourced their data from the Washington-based think tankPublic Citizen, founded by activist and former presidential candidate Ralph Nader.The data behind their findings, accessed Aug. 11, 2015, come partly from another left-leaning think tank, theEconomic Policy Institute, and the nonpartisan, federalBureau of Labor Statistics. In the report, Public Citizen claims, Ohio has endured a net loss of more than 323,000 manufacturing jobs – one out of every three – since the 1994 NAFTA and the World Trade Organization agreements took effect. (The group has since reduced the figure of 323,000 jobs lost to 307,000in a revised version.) But then, the report acknowledges that only some of those lost jobs are directly tied to overseas trade. More than 139,000 specific Ohio jobs have been certified under the Trade Adjustment Assistance (TAA) program as lost to offshoring or imports since NAFTA, the report says. The Trade Adjustment Assistance program, part of the Department of Labor, provides federal aid to manufacturers who can prove that they lost revenue due to import policies like NAFTA. Subtracting the TAA-certified number of net jobs lost due to trade agreements -- 139,000 -- from the original figure of 323,000 jobs, leaves 184,000 jobs that were lost for reasons the report doesnt, or cant, explain. In fact, one of the sources cited in the Public Citizen report, the BLS, reports that in the first quarter of 2004, 10 years after NAFTA went into effect, just 4,633 of 239,361 private sector non-farm layoffs can be associated with movement of work outside of the country. Economists say that other factors – say, a global economic downturn rivaling the Great Depression – also contribute to job losses. Ohios dip in employment was part of a nationwide trend from 2008 to 2011, when unemployment doubled from 5 to 10 percent. Tom Sutton, political science professor at Baldwin Wallace University, says that Wall Street has much more to do with the recession and associated job losses than NAFTA. Unemployment surged largely due to the collapse of financial markets following the failure of risky bundled mortgage investments. Economists have also noted that shifts in employment in sectors like manufacturing or agriculture could also be attributed to technological breakthroughs that created jobs in some sectors and cost jobs in others, like when machines replace humans on the assembly line. In other words, the effects of NAFTA cant be measured without considering all the other forces pushing and pulling the states economy. So noted the Congressional Research Service in its 2004 report aboutNAFTA 10 years out, which concludes, NAFTA had little or no impact on aggregate employment. Our ruling Strickland said, With 320,000 net Ohio manufacturing jobs lost, Portman calls NAFTA a proven success.  The implication that NAFTA is solely responsible is a gross oversimplification of a very complex economic phenomenon. Just as one politicians four-year term cant be the sole cause of over a quarter-million lost jobs, the NAFTA trade deal isnt wholly to blame either."
8974,true,Lenny Curry,Says Barack Obama promised he would cut the deficit in half but didnt.,"Lenny Curry, the head of the Republican Party of Florida, said President Barack Obama is going to have a hard time winning Florida, citing gas prices and federal spending as just two reasons.Obamas going to come here and spend a lot of money, but President Obama's going to have to run on his record. He's going to have to run on what he promised, said Curry in an interview on Bay News 9s Political Connections on March 4, 2012.He promised gasoline I believe at $2.50. When he took office it was about $1.68. We know it's well above $2.50 now. He promised he would cut the deficit in half. We know what's happened there, Curry said.Curry went on to praise Florida Gov. Rick Scott for job creation, saying that Scott showed a clear contrast with the Obama administration.Curry, a businessman from Jacksonville, became head of the state party in September 2011. He was the hand-picked successor of party chairman Dave Bitner, who died after a fight with Lou Gehrig's disease.We wondered if Curry was accurate in describing Obamas promises to voters, so we decided to check it out. Here at PolitiFact, we take a special interest in the campaign promises of elected officials. We collected Obamas promises for our Obameter and Scotts promises for the Scott-O-Meter.Here, well look at whether Obama promised to cut the deficit in half. (In a separate report, well look at whether he promised to keep gasoline prices at $2.50 a gallon.)Our research revealed that Obama did in fact promise to cut the deficit in half. He made the promise not on the campaign trail, but soon after taking office, at a meeting organized by the White House and dubbed the Fiscal Responsiblity Summit. (The Republican Party of Florida pointed us to this event when we asked them for evidence for Currys statement.)Heres what Obama said at the meeting on Feb. 23, 2009:Today I'm pledging to cut the deficit we inherited by half by the end of my first term in office, Obama said. Now, this will not be easy. It will require us to make difficult decisions and face challenges we've long neglected. But I refuse to leave our children with a debt that they cannot repay, and that means taking responsibility right now, in this administration, for getting our spending under control.The next day, Obama repeated the pledge, this time in an address to a joint session of Congress. Yesterday I held a fiscal summit where I pledged to cut the deficit in half by the end of my first term in office, he said.Is Obama keeping that promise? In a word, no.In 2009, the year Obama took office, the annual deficit was $1.4 trillion. (Generally speaking, the deficit is the amount the government takes in minus what it spends.)The deficit was a little smaller in 2010 and 2011, but only modestly so, at about $1.3 trillion for each year, according to numbers from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. For 2012, the budget is projected to be $1.1 trillion.The White Houses budget projections show a deficit of $901 billion in 2013, also short of Obamas goal, even if his policies are enacted by Congress, which is by no means certain.Obama was specifically asked about the promise in an interview in February 2012 with Atlantas WAGA-TV. (His campaign pointed us to those comments when we asked for response.) He said he wasnt able to keep the promise because the economic downturn was much more severe than was commonly understood in 2009.Well, we're not there because this recession turned out to be a lot deeper than any of us realized. Everybody who is out there back in 2009, if you look back at what their estimates were in terms of how many jobs had been lost, how bad the economy had contracted when I took office, everybody underestimated it. People thought that the economy contracted 3 percent. It turns out it contracted close to 9 percent. So, the die had been cast, but a lot of us didn't understand at that point how bad it was going to get. That increases the deficit because less tax revenues come in, and it means that more people are getting unemployment insurance, we're helping states more so they don't lay off teachers, etc. The key, though, is we're setting ourselves on a path where we can get our debt under control.The most important thing we can do, though, to reduce our debt is to make sure that we continue growing this economy. Weve seen some recent good news about unemployment numbers coming down, more jobs being created. Weve got to to maintain that momentum even as we make some tough choices in terms of government spending.Our rulingBack in 2009, shortly after he was inaugurated, Obama did promise to cut the deficit in half by the end of his first term. He has not been able to keep that promise, however. Obama said recently the reason for that is the economic downturn was much worse than expected, which in turn drove down tax revenues and drove up spending on things like unemployment and aid to the states.Curry, the head of the Republican Party of Florida, said that Obama promised he would cut the deficit in half. We know what's happened there. He prefaced it with a simple statement that Obama would have to run on his record."
17511,half-true,Democratic National Committee,"McCain has voted repeatedly at least six times against funding for global HIV/AIDS, malaria and TB fund, once as one of only 14 senators.","It would take a real hypocrite to announce that as president you would launch an initiative to end malaria when, as a senator, you repeatedly voted against malaria prevention efforts.That's the trap the Democratic National Committee said they caught Arizona GOP Sen. John McCain in last month after McCain, the presumptive Republican nominee for president, announced his plan to eradicate malaria. In a news release dated March 26, the DNC claimed to fact-check McCain's malaria pledge by contrasting McCain's rhetoric with the reality that McCain has voted repeatedly at least six times against funding for global HIV/AIDS, malaria and TB fund, once as one of only 14 senators. The release proceeds to list six instances between 2001 and 2003 in which McCain voted against bills or amendments that would have boosted funding for malaria prevention. An open and shut case of hypocrisy? Not quite, as it turns out. Indeed, McCain did vote against the bills cited by the DNC. But in each case, other factors cloud the issue and, in the end, McCain mostly supported less generous alternative measures favored by his party. In the 2001 vote cited by the DNC, for example, an amendment by Wisconsin Democratic Sen. Russ Feingold would have boosted funding for AIDS and malaria prevention in Africa but at the same time cut funding for Defense Department military procurement to pay for it. Many Democratic senators, including Hillary Rodham Clinton of New York, also voted against it. In both of the 2002 votes cited, McCain voted against an emergency supplemental spending bill to combat terrorism on the grounds that it included too many provisions — malaria funding included — that had nothing to do with terrorism. In the second of those votes, McCain was one of only 14 senators to oppose a less generous GOP alternative. And in the case of the 2003 votes cited by the DNC, Republicans said they preferred alternative legislation for a number of reasons, arguing that Democratic amendments didn't include language to encourage donations from other countries, would have exceeded budget restrictions, and might overwhelm the bureaucracy with so much money that it wouldn't be able to disburse it wisely. With the exception of the 2001 vote and one of the 2002 votes, the remaining four votes split mostly along party lines, with Democrats arguing that the GOP concerns were outweighed by the magnitude of the AIDS crisis in Africa. In the end, compromises were reached on funding measures that were somewhat less generous, which McCain supported. As a result, the DNC's charge of hypocrisy is only Half True. "
12017,half-true,Chris Christie,Says the United States is in the worst recovery from an economic recession since World War II.,"The central theme of the Republican presidential debate in Milwaukee, Wis., was business and economics. Fox Business moderator Sandra Smith laid out a bleak employment picture for New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie. She said there are 90 million Americans unemployed or not in the workforce at all. For those that are working, Smith said wages arent budging. Christie responded with an anecdote of a woman he met in New Hampshire who told him how she worried each month that she wouldnt have enough to pay her bills. There are tens of millions of Americans living that way after the worst recovery from an economic recession since World War II, Christie said. Is the United States in the middle of the worst recovery from an economic recession since World War II? Conveniently, the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis website has a tool that allows you to compare recessions back to 1948. Heres what the Feds site tells us. This recovery is not the worst when it comes to jobs. The Federal Reserve measures the cumulative percentage gain in employment from the point when each recession ended and the recovery began. During the recovery from the 2001 recession, employment didnt crawl out of negative territory for about 28 months. By comparison, in the recovery following the 2007 recession, at the 21-month mark, the United States began adding jobs beyond the number that existed at the start of the recovery. The following chart measures the jobs picture following every recession since World War II. The red line is the current recovery:  Seventy-six months from the start of the recovery, the economy today has produced a cumulative jobs gain of 8.9 percent. After 76 months in the recovery from the 2001 recession, the cumulative gain was 5.4 percent. There is another way to measure job trends. You can look at gains compared to the pre-recession employment peak. By that yardstick, it took 76 months to match the number of jobs in the economy before the 2007 downturn, which was the worst since World War II. It took 46 months for the recovery after the 2001 recession to reach the same point. But the job losses in 2001 were much smaller, so that recovery had less ground to regain. Economic output But Christie does have a point if you look at economic output, as measured by the Gross Domestic Product, or GDP. Looking at GDP growth, the current recovery is indeed the slowest since the Depression. Again heres the chart:  For a few quarters, the current recovery did better than the one that followed the 1980 recession, but while the current recession generally has showed slow gains, the 1980 recovery took off. The cumulative increase in real Gross Domestic Product for the present recovery is 14.2 percent. That is worse than the 17.2 percent for the 2001 recovery. Tara Sinclair is chief economist at Indeed and economics professor at George Washington University. We've just passed 61 months of consistent employment growth, and longer if you just look at private employment, Sinclair told PolitiFact. On that metric, the recovery is the longest since WWII, so that hardly seems the worst. On the other hand, the recovery has been notably slow, and we are not back to the trend level of GDP or employment that we would have expected without the recession. Sinclair added that even in terms of GDP its hard to call this the worst recoverybecause the country is emerging from what economists count as the deepest recession since World War II. Our ruling Christie said the United States is in the worst economic recovery from a recession since World War II. Christies campaign did not respond to our request for comment. The truth is it depends on what you measure. Looking at GDP growth, hes right. Looking at the employment picture, the 2001 recovery was worse. Christies claim is partially accurate. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/600cb3a9-686a-4390-8d06-4de6d4b7bec4"
5152,false,Instagram posts,mRNA technology in COVID-19 vaccines was never tested in humans.,"A widely shared social media post claims that the technology used in two of the three COVID-19 vaccines used in the U.S. had not been tested in humans — and asserts that assurances it is safe and effective are wrong. The post on Instagram, which also appeared on Twitter, states: mRNA technology has been around for decades. It had never gone past animal trials due to catastrophic side effects, including death. This technology was never 'fixed. Now mankind is being pressured to take it, with assurances that it is safe and effective. That is bulls---. The post was flagged as part of Facebooks efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook. The two vaccines that use mRNA technology, one made by Moderna and the other by Pfizer-BioNTech, were tested in tens of thousands of humans. They have been administered to more than 177 million people in the U.S. and have been shown to be safe and effective. The messenger RNA, or mRNA, technology used to create the Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech shots dates to the 1990s, though this is the first time it has been used in widely disseminated vaccines. These two mRNA vaccines use the human bodys natural immune response to their advantage. The shots give cells the directions for how to make a harmless spike protein. Such spike proteins are found on the surface of the virus that causes COVID-19 — and it is these proteins that the virus uses to bind to cells. The immune system of a person who receives the mRNA vaccine then spots the unknown protein and makes antibodies to fight it. The third vaccine used in the U.S., by Johnson & Johnson, is different. Instead of RNA, it uses a disabled adenovirus to deliver instructions to produce the coronavirus spike proteins and activate the immune system. The mRNA technology previously was tested against other viruses like influenza; Moderna began its testing in 2015. In 2018, Pfizer and BioNTech announced a partnership to start developing an mRNA vaccine to prevent influenza. The various development efforts shifted to creating an mRNA vaccine for the coronavirus when the pandemic hit. The testing of the COVID-19 mRNA vaccines was done on tens of thousands of people. Pfizer and Moderna got approval to test their shots on animals while simultaneously running Phase I trials on humans, prior to the vaccines getting emergency use authorization from the FDA in December 2020 for distribution to the general public. More than 177 million people have received at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine in the United States, with minimal complications reported despite the massive sample size. Among people who are fully vaccinated, the mRNA vaccines reduce the risk of COVID-19, including severe illness, by 90% or more, according to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. While a number of claims have been made suggesting that the vaccine is unsafe or has resulted in dangerous side-effects, PolitiFact has found that most of them stem from incomplete use of data contained in a federal database known as Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System, or VAERS. The database is a critical tool for researchers, but a breeding ground for misinformation about vaccine after-effects. Anyone can submit a report, and the reports are widely accessible. But the reports are not verified. Reports of adverse events to VAERS following vaccination, including deaths, do not necessarily mean that a vaccine caused a health problem, the CDC says. A review of available clinical information, including death certificates, autopsy, and medical records, has not established a causal link to COVID-19 vaccines.. Serious adverse events after COVID-19 vaccination are rare but can occur. For example, CDC and FDA have confirmed 393 reports of myocarditis or pericarditis — inflammation of the heart — in people after mRNA vaccination. A widely circulated social media post claimed that the mRNA technology in COVID-19 vaccines was never tested in humans, now mankind is being pressured to take it, with assurances that it is safe and effective. The two predominant COVID-19 vaccines in the U.S., Moderna and Pfizer, use mRNA technology and were tested in tens of thousands of humans before they were authorized. The clinical trials and the real-world results have shown both vaccines to be safe and effective."
11863,mostly-true,Facebook posts,A white armed-robbery suspect was sentenced to two years in jail while a black armed-robbery suspect was sentenced to 26 years in prison by the same Florida judge.,"Research shows African Americans face harsher treatment than whites in the criminal justice system, including longer prison sentences. A Facebook post tries to illustrate that point through a graphic comparing the results of two cases overseen by the same judge. The post compares the case of Chase Legleitner, a white 19-year-old, with Lamar Lloyd, a black 21-year-old. It says that Legleitner was sentenced to two years in jail while Lloyd was sentenced to 26 years in prison — both by Circuit Court Judge Sherwood Bauer Jr. in the 19th Circuit in Martin County. The claim gets the basic facts correct, but it omits an additional difference in the white defendants case. The post was flagged as part of Facebooks efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) A similar graphic has circulated at least since 2018. This claim was also shared by various celebrities commenting on racial injustice in June following the death of George Floyd in police custody. The juxtaposition of the two robbery cases is from the Sarasota Herald-Tribunes award-winning 2016 Bias on the Bench series. The newspaper examined millions of court documents on crimes in Florida from 2004 through 2016. The investigation concluded that blacks are more likely to be found guilty than whites and usually get longer sentences. One article used the sentences for Legleitner and Lloyd as an example to show that Bauer sentenced African Americans to longer terms. Bauer told the newspaper that race is of complete insignificance in his treatment of defendants. Here are the basic facts of the two cases: Legleitner robbed men in a 2008 drug deal. Lloyd robbed a Pizza Hut and gas station the following year. Both men pleaded no contest to two counts of armed robbery and had open pleas, which means they werent promised a particular sentence. Each had a single misdemeanor on his record and tallied the same point total on scoresheets used to determine incarceration time. Based on their score of 138 points, the states guidelines called for a sentence of just under seven years to life in prison. Bauer sentenced Lloyd to 26 years in prison in 2010, and the following year sentenced Legleitner to about two years in jail, including time already served. David Lustgarten, the assistant state attorney who prosecuted Legleitner, told PolitiFact that the defendants point totals on the scoresheet dont tell the full story. Lustgarten said he was familiar with the facts of Lloyds case. Legleitner, he said, was one of about a half dozen defendants who were involved in a scheme to approach other men under the guise of buying drugs, but planned to rob them. Legleitner helped the prosecution build the case against the co-defendants who were armed, including testifying against one at trial. I told Judge Bauer at sentencing that without his testimony I would have never secured a conviction against the two bad actors, Lustgarten said. The Herald-Tribune article alluded to the fact that Legleitner cooperated when it stated that the prosecutor lobbied hard for leniency. Legleitners defense attorney didnt respond to our questions. Lloyds case involved fewer defendants. Lloyds was a clear-cut case, said Adam Guzi, who prosecuted Lloyd and recommended a 30-year sentence. Guzi said he had witness accounts from the Pizza Hut and the Sunoco gas station as well as another witness who had spotted the defendants appearing to inspect another restaurant earlier. Prosecutors didnt need Lloyds cooperation to convict the other man, Guzi said. Lloyds defense attorney, J.D. Lewis IV, said he thought that his clients sentence was outrageous at the time. But asked about the role of race in Lloyds sentencing, he told PolitiFact, I cant personally say there is evidence that race was a factor. In general though, Lewis said he believes that there are racial disparities in the criminal-justice system. I would be naive to think racism does not play a part in the criminal justice system, he said. Following the Herald-Tribunes series, the 12th judicial circuit wrote a rebuttal, which included an analysis of the two robbery cases handled by Bauer in the 19th circuit. Bauers office directed us to part of the rebuttal written by Diamond Litty, public defender for the 19th circuit (Legleitner and Lloyd both had private counsel.) The public defender pointed to Lustgartens testimony at the sentencing hearing that Legleitner was morally cooperative, honest, forthright, and remorseful. The public defender also noted that Legleitner stole from someone who was a drug user or dealer, while Lloyd stole from employees at work. We sent a summary of our findings to Marc Mauer, executive director of the Sentencing Project, a criminal justice advocacy group. Mauer questioned why states have a complex scoring system in their sentencing guidelines if it doesnt pick up significant case distinctions. In this case, essentially the black defendant gets sentenced by the guidelines system and the white defendant gets the benefit of wide-ranging judicial discretion, he said. This doesn't necessarily mean that the white defendant got off too easy— just as likely that the black defendant got punished too severely. Prosecutors have long recommended a reduced sentence in exchange for a defendants cooperation, Mauer said. But in the era of mandatory sentences and enhanced prosecutorial power, the scale of that benefit has increased dramatically. So defendants who don't have information to trade or wish to contest the charges are faced with the prospect of a dramatically higher sentence for the same conduct as another who chooses to plead guilty, he said. A 2000 research report by the National Institute of Justice, a federal agency, concluded that despite decades of reform efforts, in some jurisdictions, blacks and Hispanics received longer sentences or differential benefits from guideline departures than similarly situated white offenders. The disparities appeared in Southern and non-Southern jurisdictions, in state and federal court systems, and in jurisdictions with and without sentencing guidelines. A Facebook post said a white armed robbery suspect was sentenced to two years in jail while a black armed robbery suspect was sentenced to 26 years in prison by the same Florida judge in two separate cases. The post gets the basic facts correct: The two defendants both pleaded no contest to the same crime, both had one prior misdemeanor and both scored the same number of points on a system designed to calculate their sentences. But prosecutors said the white defendant got a reduced sentence after cooperating with prosecutors to convict co-defendants, a fact thats not mentioned in the graphic. "
9122,true,Austin Scott,Ninety-seven percent of Americans do not receive subsidies for health care under the Affordable Care Act.,"(Editor's note: An earlier version of this fact-check included an incorrect number for the $1.7 billion in monthly tax credits potentially at risk for 6.4 million people in Georgia and 33 other states in the lawsuitKing v. Burwell.)  The U.S. Supreme Court is expected to rule later this month in a lawsuit that could wipe out premium subsidies for millions of Americans under President Barack Obamas healthcare law.  About 6.4 million people in Georgia and 33 other states who use the federal marketplace could be at risk of losing a total of $1.7 billion in monthly tax credits and face net premium increases of 287 percent, according to a state-by-state analysis by the Kaiser Family Foundation.  Many in the GOP, particularly Tea Party Republicans, are likely to resist extending the subsidies, even temporarily, The Washington Times reported June 5.  Those Republicans are much more worried about angering their base by appearing to concede on Obamacare than they are about having a handful of constituents lose their subsidies, the newspaper said..  Ninety-seven percent of Americans aren't receiving those subsidies, Georgia Congressman Austin Scott told reporters.  That statistic caught the eye of a PolitiFact reader who asked us to do some checking. Is that claim accurate? the reader wrote. . We promised to do some checking.  First a little background about the closely watched lawsuit, King v. Burwell.   The plaintiff, King, argues that because the health care law refers to an exchange established by the state, individuals in states with federally run exchanges are not eligible for subsidies.   Others contend that the clear intent of the ACA -- the most significant overhaul of U.S.healthcare since passage of Medicare and Medicaid in 1965 -- is to allow individuals to obtain subsidized insurance regardless of whether they obtain it through a state or federal exchange.  Currently, 34 states rely on the federal exchange and could lose subsidies if the Supreme Court rules in favor of King.   Florida could be the most affected, with 1.3 million residents losing monthly subsidies worth a combined $206 million a month, according to forecasts.  In Georgia, 412,385 people could lose subsidies, with a total monthly value of $113 million, the Kaiser Family Foundation analysis showed.  States such California and New York, which set up their own exchanges, would be untouched by the ruling.  So what about Scotts statement that 97 percent of Americans arent receiving ACA insurance subsidies. We reached out to Ryann DuRant, Scotts communications director.  She told us Scotts statement was based on calculations that were done using data from the Kaiser Family Foundation analysis, reports in The Atlanta Journal-Constitution and population information from the U.S. Census.  This includes: about 6.4 million people who receive federal subsidies to buy insurance;, estimates of all insurance subsidies, state and federal combined,totalling about nine million; the national population estimate of about 318 million. (We calculated 2.83 percent or just shy or 3 percent with subsidies, leaving about 97 percent of Americans without subsidies)  We asked the Kaiser Family Foundation in D.C.to independently run the numbers for us.  Chris Lee, a communications officer with the foundation, said about 2.7 percent of Americans receive ACA tax credits.   His calculation is based on information that slightly more than 8.6 million of the nations 321 million residents have received advance premium tax credits, or subsidies, to buy their insurance, Lee said.  That would mean about 97.3 percent of Americans arent receiving subsidies to buy insurance.  DuRant told us Scott is co-sponsoring a bill, introduced June 4, to repeal ObamaCare and address healthcare for all Americans.  So in no way was this to discount the 3 percent or the 97 percent, she said. We are concerned with 100 percent of Americans and with lowering health insurance premiums for 100 percent of Americans.  The GOP-controlled Congress has repeatedly expressed interest in passing legislation to fully repeal and replace ObamaCare, and Scotts bill is one of several options that is available.  .Our ruling U.S. Rep. Austin Scott said 97 percent of Americans dont receive subsidies for health care under the Affordable Care Act. His numbers are close.  "
1863,mostly-true,Rick Santorum,Ninety percent of American workers don't own their own business.,"Rick Santorum, a potential candidate for president in 2016, argues that the Republicans should focus more on people working for businesses than people who own businesses, if only because of simple math. Santorum said Republicans need to concentrate more on the concerns of ordinary voters. I've made the central focus of what I've been out talking about the fact that 90 percent of American workers don't own their own business. They're actually working for businesses and that Republicans better have a message that appeals to their place in the world today and their opportunity to rise in society, Santorum said on CBSs Face the Nation on April 5, 2015. We wanted to know whether Santorum is correct that 90 percent of the American workers do not own their own business. Matthew E. Bynon, a staff member at Santorums organization Patriot Voices, sent us a link to a policy brief, The Causes of Racial Disparities in Business Performance, from the NationalPoverty Center. This 2008 article mentions in its introduction, Roughly 1 in 10 workers owns a business, which are 13 million business owners. The report based its numbers on data from the U.S. Census Bureau. The most recent census report Survey of Business Owners estimated the number of business owners as 20.4 million in 2007. According to U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics the labor force in 2007 was about 153 million people. So there were around 13.3 percent business owners, a little higher than Santorums source. A new census survey about business owners will be released in May.  The economists of the Small Business Administration used more recent data from 2012 and found a slightly higher percentage of business owners as well. The SBA found that about 16 percent of people owned a business, said staff member Miguel Ayala. Its important to note that the SBA based its 16 percent number on total employment of about 116 million people. If you use the entire labor force, both employed and unemployed, the number drops to 11.8 percent. So the SBA estimates the total of business owners in the United States to be 18.3 million people. The census found out that there were 20.4 million business owners back in 2007. We couldnt help noticing that the data Santorum referred to does not match, because it says 13 million. So we asked Robert W. Fairlie, economics professor at the University of California, Santa Cruz, for an explanation. Fairlie was one of the authors who wrote the study Black-, Asian-, and White-Owned Businesses in the United States, which was used for the NPC policy brief Santorum referred to. Fairlie said there are different ways to define small business owners. Not all people who own a business do it as their main source of employment. The 20.4 million businesses represents all business entities and not necessarily what someone does for their main job activity. If someone gets a little self-employment income, but mainly works as a wage or salary worker, then they would not get included in the 13 million number of business owners, but would get included in the 20.4 million definition, Fairlie said in an email. Our ruling Santorum said 90 percent of people dont own their own business. Several sources show that Santorums number is close. However, there are different ways to count whether someone owns a business or not, and so the percentages are approximate."
10387,false,Facebook posts,"Social media posts stated: Remember Kamala telling Joe during the debate, You will do whatever the Chinese tell you! They gave your son over a billion dollars.","An image making rounds on Facebook, Twitter and other social media platforms claims Vice President Kamala Harris said during a 2019 Democratic debate that President Joe Biden would do whatever the Chinese government wants because they gave his son over a billion dollars.  The image featured cropped and merged photos of Harris, who was a senator from California at the time, and Biden at the June 27, 2019, Democratic debate, which was held in Miami, Florida, and sponsored by NBC, MSNBC and Telemundo. The way the images are cropped and combined depicts Harris and Biden standing face-to-face, by deleting U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders, an Independent from Vermont, who was standing at his lectern between Biden and Harris at the debate. Text above the photos reads, Anyone remember Kamala telling Joe during the debate: You will do whatever the Chinese tell you! They gave your son over a billion dollars. Theres just one problem with the quote: According to transcripts of the Democratic debates, Harris never said it. We decided to look at the false claim and where it came from. Facebook flagged this image as part of its efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about PolitiFact Californias partnership with Facebook.) One Facebook users post featuring the image had been shared more than 400 times as of April 30. Another was shared 183,000 times. The image racked up more than 3.3 million views within 24 hours. The claim and the transcripts The images claim references allegations that swirled around Biden and his son, Hunter Biden, in the time leading up to the 2020 election. Hunter Biden had an investment deal that involved the Bank of China while his father was serving as vice president, which former President Donald Trump and other Republicans touted as an example of improper ethics and corruption. Trump repeatedly stated that the business deal made the Bidens more than $1 billion. The business deal remains murky because of minimal disclosure requirements for international investments, and nobody has been able to independently verify how much Hunter Biden made off the deal. In a previous fact check, PolitiFact found no evidence that either Joe Biden or Hunter Biden broke any laws, although experts in political ethics said the deal was unwise and put Joe Biden in an awkward position. Additionally, experts noted that relatives of high-ranking American public officials of both parties have routinely been courted by Chinese businesses. During the first five Democratic debates, Harris never discussed any of the controversy surrounding the Bidens. Harris suspended her presidential campaign on Dec. 3, 2019, so she was not present for the six remaining Democratic debates. Her only significant comment on China came during the Sept. 12, 2019, debate in Houston, Texas, when she was asked how her trade policy would differ from former President Barack Obama by moderator George Stephanopoulos of ABC. It's a complicated relationship, Harris said. We have to hold China accountable. They steal our products, including our intellectual property. They dump substandard products into our economy. They need to be held accountable. She added that the United States should also seek to partner with China on climate and the crisis that presents and on the issue of North Korea. Harris did occasionally spar with Biden on stage, most notably in the first Democratic debate on June 27, 2019, when she said she wanted to speak on the issue of race and criticized Biden for his hurtful comments surrounding prominent segregationists and his opposition to busing. When Brown v. Board of Education was decided in the U.S. Supreme Court, the Berkeley Unified School District in Berkeley, California, implemented a busing program to integrate schools. Harris was part of the cohort that began kindergarten in the district during the second year of the program. Harris drew praise for her breakout moment on stage during the debate, but her comments to Biden were entirely based around race and the history of segregation, not China or Hunter Biden. We could find no evidence that Harris made any such statements elsewhere on the campaign trail. Her office declined to comment on the claim. Additionally, no other candidate made similar statements attacking Biden over allegations surrounding his son and China during any of the Democratic debates. Former President Donald Trump did attack Biden over China during two presidential debates. Our research A search of the false quote turns up results dating back to January 2021. The earliest evidence of the quote on Facebook was posted on Jan. 24 and appears to have come from a page run by a group called Activated Patriots. The group protects freedom, God and guns and is based in Wisconsin, according to their website.  The Activated Patriots post included the false quote, but in the posts text, rather than in an image. It also included additional statements mischaracterizing several of Harriss comments during the Democratic debates and on the campaign trail during and after her presidential bid. On April 29, the post was deleted from the Activated Patriots page. It had been shared more than 450 times. The false quote appears to have originated on Twitter on Jan. 23, less than 24 hours before the Activated Patriots post on Facebook, when @BlessUSA2024 tweeted it out. The pro-Trump account was created in September 2019 and has more than 26,000 followers as of April 30. It has previously shared misinformation related to QAnon, a baseless conspiracy theory that claims there is a deep state run by political elites, business leaders and celebrities that engages in pedophilia and works against former President Donald Trump and his allies.  The tweet had received 700 likes as of April 30 and was retweeted more than 600 times. PolitiFact reached out to Activated Patriots and the @BlessUSA2024 account for comment, but received no response. Our ruling Social media posts claimed that Vice President Kamala Harris told President Joe Biden during the Democratic debates, You will do whatever the Chinese tell you! They gave your son over a billion dollars. Transcripts of the debates show that this is wholly incorrect. Harris never made such a statement and rarely touched on China during the debates. When she did, she did not reference the murky allegations surrounding Bidens son and his business dealings with Chinese companies. Harris made no such statements elsewhere on the campaign trail and none of Bidens other competitors made similar comments. Furthermore, the quote has not been substantiated by any reputable news organization and appears to have originated on social media from pro-Trump accounts. PANTS ON FIRE – The statement is not accurate and makes a ridiculous claim."
13663,mostly-false,Chris Murphy,The 2017/2018 budgets gave (President Donald) Trump billions for border upgrades. Hes spent ALMOST NONE of it. 6%.,"Has the Trump administration spent just 6 percent of the money allocated by Congress for border upgrades? As the parties battle over border funding — the fight that prompted the government shutdown that began Dec. 22, 2018 — the 6 percent figure has become a Democratic talking point. There are a million reasons why $5B for a wall is a ludicrous demand to shut down the government over, tweeted Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., on Dec. 23. But heres maybe the best one: the 2017/2018 budgets gave Trump billions for border upgrades. Hes spent ALMOST NONE of it. 6%. How about spending the money you have first? There are a million reasons why $5B for a wall is a ludicrous demand to shut down the government over.But heres maybe the best one: the 2017/2018 budgets gave Trump billions for border upgrades. Hes spent ALMOST NONE of it. 6%. How about spending the money you have first? However, the 6 percent figure isnt the only way to look at this question — nor is it necessarily the best one, experts say. The accuracy of Murphys statement boils down to how to measure federal outlays. When Congress passes spending bills, it gives that money to a federal agency. The agency, in turn, does the preparatory work to get a particular project accomplished. So do you count it only when a check is cut to a vendor? Or do you measure it when the money is obligated for a specific use -- by signing a contract, for instance? As it turns out, the choice of measurement makes a big difference. The 6 percent figure first emerged from Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., the ranking member on the Senate Appropriations Committee. (Our friends at the Washington Post Fact Checker awarded his statement Three Pinocchios.) Leahys minority staff issued a news release Dec. 10 that said in part, Over the last two years, Congress has provided nearly $1.7 billion to build or replace fencing on the southern border, but the administration has hardly spent any of that money, and the projects it has undertaken have ballooned in cost. So far, only 6 percent of those funds have been spent. Six. (For emphasis, the news release put Six in bold type.) According to the committee, Customs and Border Protection reported in late November that the total enacted funds for this purpose in 2017 and 2018 were $1,716,066,065. Of that, $1,602,675,723 was obligated, and $108,695,342 was formally spent. So, expenditures did amount to about 6 percent of the funds that Congress enacted, as Leahys news release said. But if you use the other data point, about 93 percent of those funds were obligated. Consider this analogy: You go to the dry cleaners and bring in a couple of suits. By handing over the suits to the cleaner, youve committed to paying the cost, even if you havent forked over the money yet. Steve Ellis, a veteran federal budget expert with the group Taxpayers for Common Sense, told PolitiFact that obligations are a better measurement with construction funds. That doesnt mean you should run with the 93 percent number, either. A U.S. Customs and Border Protection spokesman told PolitiFact that 60 percent of the funds have gone so far as to reach the contract award stage. This means that a vendor begins work on the border wall, beginning with design and followed by construction, said spokesman Andrew Meehan. Expenditures happen at a later stage, when a contractor bills the government after the work has been completed, he said. Heres a breakdown of the projects, according to the agency: • The fiscal year 2017 enacted appropriations provided $341 million to construct 40 miles of replacement primary pedestrian wall and vehicle barriers in multiple locations across the southwest border. So far, the Army Corps of Engineers has placed nearly $300 million on contracts, and as of Dec. 21, 2018, had completed work on 35 of those 40 miles. • The fiscal year 2018 enacted appropriations provided $1.375 billion to construct about 82 miles of new and replacement border barriers in multiple locations across the southwest border. Between March and July 2018, approximately $1.2 billion had been obligated to the Army Corps of Engineers for construction, real estate acquisition, and program management. And by Dec. 31, 2018, the Corps had a little less than $700 million under contract for construction of new and replacement wall system in the Rio Grande Valley, Tucson, Yuma, El Centro and San Diego sectors. An additional $300 million or so is ready to award when the government reopens. Leahys office stood by its initial 6 percent calculation, telling PolitiFact, The fact is that as of the end of November, only 6 percent of the funds appropriated by Congress for physical barriers along the southern border over the last two years has actually been spent. Murphys office also stood by Leahys calculation. Murphy tweeted, The 2017/2018 budgets gave (President Donald) Trump billions for border upgrades. Hes spent ALMOST NONE of it. 6%. This is a misleading talking point that makes it sound as if Trumps administration is dawdling on the border wall at the center of the government funding dispute. The 6 percent figure refers to actual checks that have been cut. But at this early stage of a multi-year construction project, the more relevant figure is how much money has been committed under contract. Thats about 60 percent — 10 times the figure that Murphy and other Democrats have used."

Theres no evidence to suggest graphene oxide can literally turn people into zombies. But theres a bigger problem with the theory: None of the vaccines contain graphene oxide. The post was flagged as part of Facebooks efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Graphene-family materials have an array of uses in biotechnology, and theres evidence that the compound can be toxic in certain circumstances. But claims that the COVID-19 vaccines contain the substance have proven untrue. We previously fact-checked a claim that falsely said graphene oxide — a material made by the oxidation of graphite — was used in Pfizers COVID-19 vaccine. A company spokesperson told us that the material is used in some vaccines, but none by Pfizer. None of the listed ingredients is another name for graphene oxide, and the material doesnt appear in ingredient lists for the Moderna and Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccines. Ron Mertens, founder and CEO of Graphene-Info.com, a graphene news website, said graphene oxide is not magnetic and not a conductive material, so it cannot be used in the ways people suggest in such videos. Full Fact, a fact-checking organization in the United Kingdom, reported that the rumors about graphene oxide in vaccines appear to have originated with a Spanish study from June 2021. The report claimed that, using a microscopic technique, a solution created from a vial of Pfizers vaccine was observed to be similar in form to graphene oxide. But the study hasnt been published in a journal or peer-reviewed, and it offers no conclusive evidence. Its not even clear that the vial being tested contained a legitimate vaccine sample. Fact-checkers at Health Feedback reported that the person who sent the vial to the researcher has been known to spread anti-vaccine content.

16935,false,Donald Trump,"Untaxed corporate earnings used to be $2.5 trillion  I guess its $5 trillion now. Whatever it is, its a lot more. So we have anywhere from 4 (trillion) to 5 or even more trillions of dollars sitting offshore.","President Donald Trump said U.S. companies have anywhere from $4 trillion to $5 trillion in offshore accounts — a substantial increase from just last year. Trump blamed the large sum of money on what he (inaccurately) considers the highest tax rate in the world in a July 25 Wall Street Journal interview obtained by Politico. Were the highest-taxed nation in the world, essentially, you know, of the size, Trump said. But were the highest-taxed nation in the world. We have — nobody knows what the number is. I mean, it used to be, when we talked during the debate, $2.5 trillion  I guess its $5 trillion now. Whatever it is, its a lot more. So we have anywhere from 4 (trillion) to 5 or even more trillions of dollars sitting offshore. Weve already rated Trumps previous claims that were the highest-taxed nation in the world False. This time we took a look at the amount of U.S. money sitting in offshore accounts. How much untaxed foreign revenue is out there, and could the figure have doubled since Trump cited the $2.5 trillion figure during the 2016 campaign? The White House did not provide information for this fact-check. Well start off by saying there is no public estimate on untaxed earnings overseas, as there is no law requiring they be reported. Researchers can instead look at the indefinitely reinvested earnings on financial statements of publicly traded companies. Indefinitely invested earnings arent making their way back to the United States anytime soon, which lets them off the hook for taxes and thus fatten after-tax profits. They might go to overseas factories, prospective acquisitions or other investments. Other companies may instead take on a deferred liability, which entails a future tax bill -- but while currently untaxed, most go undisclosed, so they arent counted in the researchers figures. The nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation can provide a fuller picture, because the committee has access to total untaxed foreign earnings. However, that information is only turned over to members of Congress. The last time the committee made its findings public was in an August 2016 memo to two congressmen. In 2012, the committee said, $2.3 trillion of foreign earnings went untaxed. Using predictive models, they estimated the number at $2.6 trillion for 2015. The committee cited Audit Analytics, a third-party research service, to corroborate these findings. Audit Analytics found $2.4 trillion in indefinitely reinvested earnings. There was a $200 billion difference between the JCTs estimate of untaxed foreign earnings and Audit Analytics calculation of indefinitely reinvested ones, which is what experts estimate the current discrepancy to be. Audit Analytics ran its latest numbers for us. The company found $2.8 trillion of indefinitely reinvested earnings are sitting overseas, as of July 2017 — far short of what Trump described. It is possible that analysts are still working on entering information from small companies, but it would not change the number from the rounded-off figure of 2.8 trillion, Audit Analytics research director Don Whalen said. We also turned to the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, which found that Fortune 500 companies — a slightly smaller pool —report $2.6 trillion offshore. ITEP included total untaxed earnings, not just indefinitely reinvested ones, in their studies of Apple and Pfizer, as these companies provide a disclosure allowing for a fuller estimate of their untaxed offshore income and generate a significant amount of earnings through this mechanism. There is no reason to believe that this figure is substantially higher than what companies report and certainly not double the reported amount as President Donald Trump has contended without citing any source, said Taxation and Economic Policy senior policy analyst Richard Phillips. So what else could cause the discrepancy? Edward Kleinbard, the Robert C. Packard Trustee Chair in Law at the USC's Gould School of Law, said that firms double down their offshore tax planning when they expect a tax holiday, which is when they get to bring back offshore earnings while paying little to no taxes on them. Its plausible that people have accelerated their gamesmanship in the anticipation that in tax reform there will be another tax holiday, Kleinbard said. But its not plausible to think the number could be as high as the 2 trillion-dollar difference between the data and what the president said. Another possibility is for Trump to have counted tax inversions, which is when a small foreign company in a lower taxed country acquires a larger U.S. company and thus reduces their taxes. But that would entail a change in the definition of untaxed revenue. And even if we were to make that calculation, Kleinbard said the number wouldnt expand by so much in such a short time span. Trump described untaxed corporate earnings in overseas accounts as growing monumentally, from around $2.5 trillion to anywhere from 4 (trillion) to 5 or even more trillions of dollars sitting offshore. The highest reported number of offshore earnings is $2.8 trillion. That could be off by a couple hundred billion dollars due to undisclosed untaxed earnings. But experts agreed the discrepancy could not add up to Trumps $4 trillion or $5 trillion estimate. Business optimism and altered definitions of untaxed revenue couldnt bridge that gap either."
16592,half-true,Jerry Patterson,"Says Sierra Club sued him to stop oil and gas activity on Texas coast, but we won and the turtles are fine.","Sea turtles surfaced at the state Republican convention in Fort Worth -- in a speech.State Land Commissioner Jerry Patterson said June 9, 2012: I have been sued by the Sierra Club. Sued me. They wanted to stop oil and gas exploration, production, on the Texas Gulf Coast, he said. We won. Were producing oil and gas, and the turtles are fine.We decided to check on the oil and gas and turtles.Patterson told us by phone that he was referring to a 2002 lawsuit brought by the Lone Star Chapter of the Sierra Club over drilling at the Padre Island National Seashore, the federal park southeast of Corpus Christi on North Padre Island that is a nesting ground for sea turtles including the endangered Kemps ridley.We looked up the case on the U.S. District Court website for the Southern District of Texas, where records show the suit was filed April 18, 2002, and dismissed May 7, 2003. The Sierra Club took the decision to the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which dismissed the appeal Aug. 27, 2003.The club sued the U.S. secretary of the interior, National Park Service and U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, saying they had not done enough wildlife impact analysis to comply with federal laws before giving BNP Petroleum of Corpus Christi permission to drill in the park.When the area became a federal park in 1962, the original private landowners and the state retained the rights to extract and profit from minerals at the site. According to the parks website, drilling has occurred there since the 1950s. The states share of royalties from oil and gas goes into the Texas Permanent School Fund, an endowment established in 1876 to channel income from state lands to Texas public schools.The Sierra Club lawsuit sought an injunction to halt drilling permits until the defendants complied with the federal laws the club claimed were broken. The district court, however, found that the government had sufficiently investigated the impact of drilling and operation on the turtles, and the appeals court affirmed that decision.So, was Patterson sued, as he says?We realized he could not have been one of the parties originally sued in 2002 -- he wasnt even elected land commissioner until November 2002. Rather, court records and our phone interview with Patterson spokesman Jim Suydam showed that in his role as land commissioner, Patterson filed to intervene in the suit Jan. 14, 2003. After that, according to the court documents and an April 19, 2003, Associated Press news story, Patterson was listed as a defendant in the suit.According to the appeals court summary, the district court said government had not shirked its duties in estimating the effect drilling would have on the turtles, noting that the Park Services March 2001 oil and gas management plan spelled out restrictions and mitigation requirements. The plans 16 pages of drilling/production requirements include measures such as having turtle-spotting monitors precede heavy equipment being driven along the beach and shielding light sources so turtles would not become disoriented.The courts dismissals of both the lawsuit and the clubs appeal amounted to victory for the government, or as Patterson said, We won.And how about those turtles?Texas coast once had many.According to a news story in the June 2012 issue of the Texas Parks and Wildlife Departments magazine, canneries nearly wiped out the Texas green turtle population after the Civil War. The departments website said the turtles were hit hard again from the 1940s to 1960s by people gathering and selling truckloads of eggs. Today, the story said, the shrimping industry is the biggest threat. Sea turtles must surface to breathe; if theyre trapped below water in a net, they will drown.All species in Texas waters — leatherback, hawksbill, loggerhead, green and Kemps ridley — are listed as either threatened or endangered, the story said. The Parks and Wildlife website said Kemps ridleys are the most endangered sea turtle species in the world.In a U.S.-Mexico program from 1978-88, Kemps ridley eggs from a turtle sanctuary in Tamaulipas were brought to Padre to hatch, imprinting the baby turtles to return there for nesting, according to the story, which also said, All along the Texas coast, scientists and advocates have dedicated their careers to sea turtle research and protection.According to news stories dating from 2002 through August 2012 that we found using the Nexis news database, since 1996, turtle nest counts on the Texas coast have risen almost every year. Texas growing colony of Kemps ridleys now serves as a backup of sorts -- if disaster struck the Tamaulipas sanctuary, the species might not be wiped out.Carole Allen, Gulf office director with the nonprofit Sea Turtle Restoration Project, told us by email that she believes the major reasons for rising turtle numbers are increased protection of the turtles in Tamaulipas and the requirement of turtle excluder devices on U.S. shrimp boats. The devices, called TEDs, provide a grill of bars in a trawl net that large sea creatures can fit through; shrimpers, however, sometimes sew nets together again to counteract that escape hatch.In its 2002 lawsuit, the Sierra Club described ways that oil and gas operations could harm turtles, but included no measurement of harm occurring. We checked with the clubs lead volunteer in the lawsuit, Pat Suter, who chairs the Corpus Christi chapter. She told us by phone, As far as I know, there has not been direct impact on the turtles that can be proved.Sierra said in its suit that trucks traveling to and from the well site would threaten turtles. The news articles we reviewed included no reports of turtles hurt or discouraged from nesting by oil and gas rigs, trucks, drilling or pumping at the federal park. Separately, an April 15, 2004, white paper on the parks website said, There has been vehicle traffic, from both visitors and heavy equipment operators, on the Gulf of Mexico shoreline for over fifty years with no documented case of a crushing of a nesting sea turtle within the park.Allen told us, My personal opinion is that everything is being done to protect nesting sea turtles and hatchlings from being run over at the National Seashore. Kemp's ridleys are in far more danger from law-breaking shrimpers.As we closed out this check, Suydam conceded that Patterson was not sued by the Sierra Club.It looks like Commissioner Patterson misspoke there, Suydam said. He intervened in the Sierra Club's lawsuit, and then became a defendant. Still, Suydam said, The sentiment is true. When the Sierra Club sues to stop oil and gas exploration, it is in effect suing to limit oil and gas production on Permanent School Fund lands, which is Pattersons responsibility.Our rulingThe Sierra Club did not sue Patterson; he wasnt quite land commissioner when the group filed its suit against federal agencies.Still, he later joined the lawsuit, which the government won. And, despite ongoing oil and gas activity at the park in accord with the 1962 terms, Texas threatened and endangered sea turtles are increasing in numbers."
15024,mostly-false,Joe Biden,"When I came into office, the prior administration had contracted for not nearly enough vaccine to cover adults in America.","During a March 2 news conference on the COVID-19 pandemic, President Joe Biden claimed that former President Donald Trumps administration did not ensure there would be enough vaccines for the American public. When I came into office, the prior administration had contracted for not nearly enough vaccine to cover adults in America, said Biden. We rectified that. Biden then announced he was using the Defense Production Act to facilitate a partnership between two competing drug companies: Merck had agreed to help manufacture the recently authorized Johnson & Johnson vaccine. The move, he said, would accelerate the timeline for the availability of vaccines to the American public: Were now on track to have enough vaccine supply for every adult in America by the end of May, he said, two months earlier than he had previously projected. Its been a common political message since the Biden administration took office that the initial vaccine rollout under Trump was chaotic. PolitiFact previously rated a claim by Bidens chief of staff, Ron Klain, that the Trump administration left no vaccine plan behind as Mostly False. So, we thought it was important to check whether Biden was going too far in alleging that the Trump administration hadnt contracted for enough vaccines to cover the American public. Lets see what the contracts, which are public documents, say. As part of Operation Warp Speed, the Trump administration entered into contracts with multiple drugmakers. The contracts were generally signed while potential vaccines were still in clinical trials. Experts told us this was smart, because the Trump administration didnt know what vaccines from which drugmakers would work, how effective they would be or how quickly they could be produced. That was the whole approach of Operation Warp Speed, said Dr. Amesh Adalja, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security. Not knowing which one would cross the finish line, the Trump administration took a portfolio approach and invested in multiple vaccines. Heres what the Trump administrations initial contracts called for drug makers to supply to the U.S. government: In total, the amounts agreed to under these contracts equal about 800 million vaccine doses, or enough for more than 400 million people. The U.S., based on U.S. Census estimates, has around 328 million people, of whom about 255 million are older than 18. (Vaccines are not yet authorized for children.) So it appears that the Trump administrations contracts with drugmakers did cover enough doses to vaccinate the entire U.S. adult population — and then some. By that measure, Bidens statement is inaccurate. An important point to remember, though, is that these contract numbers dont necessarily represent deliverable vaccines. The contracts represent early promises. There were still important hurdles that had to be cleared before these possible vaccine candidates could be a reality. Kevin Gilligan, a senior consultant with Biologics Consulting, a firm focused on pharmaceuticals, said once drugmakers develop a vaccine, they must test it through clinical trials with humans and amass enough data to show the vaccines are safe and effective and cause minimal side effects. The data is then presented to the Food and Drug Administration, which decides whether the vaccine should be authorized for emergency use. Granting an emergency use authorization means the vaccine can then be distributed to the public. Until recently, the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines were the only two that had reached that point, gaining authorization on Dec. 11 and 18 respectively. The Trump administration announced Dec. 23 that it would buy an additional 200 million doses in total of both companies vaccines. A Biden administration press official told KHN that the president was referring only to orders for the authorized vaccines. When the Trump Administration was in office, there were only two approved vaccines (Pfizer and Moderna) and the Trump Administration had not contracted for enough of them to vaccinate all Americans. They only had 400 million doses of these authorized vaccines, which is only enough for 200 million Americans. Upon coming into office, one of our first steps was to ensure that we had enough supply secured for every American. We were prepared from Day 1. On this point, the Biden White House is correct. The U.S. government had in place agreements to buy 400 million doses of the authorized vaccines, which were both two-dose vaccines — not enough for the entire U.S. adult population. Its also true that five days after Biden became president, he announced his administration had reached agreements with Moderna and Pfizer to buy a combined additional 200 million doses. That purchase was finalized on Feb. 11 and brought the total U.S. supply to 600 million doses of authorized vaccines, or enough to vaccinate 300 million people. In addition, on Feb. 27, Johnson & Johnsons vaccine was authorized for emergency use. Under the Operation Warp Speed contract, J&J is supposed to provide 100 million doses to the U.S. by the end of May, but the company is reportedly behind on production. The Biden administrations move to get J&J to team up with Merck to achieve its production goal will increase vaccine supply. But, is it fair for Biden to blame the Trump administration for not buying more of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines once they became authorized for emergency use? The answer to that isnt clear-cut, said the experts. Its not totally fair to say the prior administration didnt purchase enough, since they did move to purchase more doses after the vaccine was authorized, said Jennifer Kates, senior vice president and director of global health and HIV policy at the Kaiser Family Foundation. I think the question is should they have purchased it earlier? The New York Times reported on Dec. 7 that before Pfizers COVID-19 vaccine was shown to be highly effective in clinical trials, the company had offered the U.S. government the option to buy additional doses, but the Trump administration declined. Former Health and Human Services SecretaryAlex Azardisputed the news report, saying during a TV interview that Pfizer hadnt agreed to a production amount or delivery time for the additional vaccine, so he couldnt agree to the deal: I'm certainly not going to sign a deal with Pfizer giving them $10 billion to buy vaccine that they could deliver to us five, 10 years hence. That doesn't make any sense. James Love, director of Knowledge Ecology International, a non-governmental organization that obtained copies of COVID-19 government contracts, agreed that once it was clear the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines were likely to receive FDA authorization, the Trump administration could have taken action to make competing drug companies increase their vaccine manufacturing capacity in the way Biden did with Merck and J&J. The U.S. could have forced technology transfer between companies, which meant they would have been assured of additional vaccine manufacturing capacity, said Love. The agreements we have now about scaling manufacturing are coming pretty late actually. It takes several months to get stuff up and running. But Gilligan noted that the Biden administration had the advantage of hindsight. Biden inherited the success of vaccine development done under Trump and then expanded on it, said Gilligan. And the Biden administration has the benefit of looking back at what was done well and what wasnt and making the appropriate corrective changes. Hindsight is 20/20. Overall, there are questions around whether the Trump administration could have acted more quickly to buy doses or increase vaccine manufacturing capacity. And the Biden administration has certainly taken significant measures to expand supplies. But its stretching the truth to say the Trump administration hadnt contracted for enough Covid vaccines to inoculate the U.S. adult population. Biden said the Trump administration had contracted for not nearly enough vaccine to cover adults in America. While Trump was still in office, his administration had agreements in place to buy 400 million doses of authorized vaccine, or enough to inoculate about 200 million people. Thats less than the U.S. adult population. However, KHN/Politifact reviewed the Trump administration's Operation Warp Speed contracts, and found that those included enough vaccine doses that, once cleared for use by the FDA, could inoculate about 550 million people — more than double the U.S. adult population. Bidens statement contains an element of truth, but ignores facts that would give a different impression."
18333,mostly-false,Donald Trump,"When the wind stops blowing, thats the end of your electric.","One of President Donald Trumps new favorite political targets is Democrats Green New Deal, a sweeping approach to combating climate change. That plan embraces a greater reliance on renewable energy sources — like solar and wind — over a decade. Trump has trained his fire on wind power in particular during several recent speeches, claiming that consumers face major blackouts from nothing more than a simple shift in weather. And Trumps disdain for wind energy, as the Washington Post notes, has even deeper roots. When the wind stops blowing, that's the end of your electric, Trump told the Conservative Political Action Conference March 2. Let's hurry up. Darling, is the wind blowing today? I'd like to watch television, darling.  Trump continued hammering wind energy later that month at a rally in Michigan, saying that if Hillary Clinton had won the election the United States would not be a global leader in energy production. You would be doing wind, windmills, Trump said March 28. And if it doesn't blow you can forget about television for that night. The presidents riffs on wind energy grossly oversimplify things — perhaps for comedic effect. But the latest White House budget proposal would slash funding for renewable energy programs across the country. So we thought his comments were worth checking. Ensuring uninterrupted electricity when using renewable energy is a legitimate concern. Wind energy — and solar, for that matter — are considered intermittent energy sources, because of their dependence on weather conditions. But the issue is a manageable one under the current system, experts said. First off, the notion that a person gets electricity from only one wind farm is wrong. Thats because American energy consumers in virtually all cases get their power from an interconnected grid, which pools together a portfolio of different generators. No home connected to the continental U.S. grid is primarily reliant on the wind the occupant feels in their backyard, said Daniel Schwartz, a professor at the University of Washington and director of the Clean Energy Institute. For example, in the western United States, Schwartz said, power generation and consumption is transmitted across roughly a dozen states and Canadian provinces. On a still day in Seattle, the wind is blowing in Montana, or California, or elsewhere, he said. Michael Gillenwater, executive director of the Greenhouse Gas Management Institute, responded to Trumps claim this way: Just because the wind stops blowing in one place does not mean the whole grid goes down. Experts noted that utilities typically use a mix of sources to generate energy, including some, like natural gas, that arent susceptible to running out if the winds are low or if clouds block the sun. The current energy system has successfully integrated renewables. As of 2018, renewable sources made up around 17 percent of total U.S. energy. Among renewables, hydropower provided the most, at 7 percent, with wind energy a close second. Fossil fuels, on the other hand, accounted for nearly two-thirds of American power.  Source:U.S. Energy Information Administration​ But what would happen to grid stability if the United States increased its reliance on sources like wind and solar? That analysis hinges on several unknown variables, including how much would come from intermittent sources, whether nonrenewables would continue to serve as backups, and the pace of green technology development.  In his CPAC speech, Trumps criticism of wind energy grew out of his broader disapproval of the Green New Deal. Its in that context that Trump has a point, said Benjamin Zycher, a resident scholar at the market-oriented American Enterprise Institute who has written a forthcoming book critiquing the Green New Deal. If you define the wind power as envisioned by Trump as part of a 100% renewable system or something approaching it — as defined, say, in the Green New Deal — then Trump is correct, he said. Zycher said a 100 percent renewable system would face a series of practical challenges. Batteries cannot currently provide sufficient backup generation, he argued, so the only practical alternative to maintain grid stability would be from a non-renewable source, which would mean maintaining elements of the current system. Theres some debate about whether the Green New Deal is truly pushing for a 100% renewable system, or some lower threshold. The legislative language does not spell out what energy sources would comprise a new grid. In fact, its elasticity on this point appears to be something of a selling point. As Green New Deal co-sponsor Sen. Ed Markey, D.-Mass, said, The resolution is silent on any individual technology. We are open to whatever works. Rather, the proposal calls for 100% of power demand through clean, renewable, and zero-emissions energy sources. To some, the plan could encompasses more than just renewables, to include nuclear power, or even fossil fuels with carbon capture. Schwartz, of the Clean Energy Institute, said thechallenges of wind power are widely recognized in engineering circles. But he was bullish on the future of green technology. My reaction is optimistic, he said. I see engineering challenges, not insurmountable barriers created by the laws of nature. Already, some utilities use some of the surplus electricity they generate to pump water uphill, where it can be released downhill to generate electricity as needed. Going forward, researchers are working on additional methods, such as next-generation batteries, to store energy so it can be kept in reserve for slack periods for wind or solar generation. Gillenwater agreed theres a lively debate about the feasibility of building a 100 percent renewable system, and pointed us to this article from Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers magazine. But he noted that getting to about 80 percent is generally seen as not a problem technically or economically. Gideon Weissman, a policy analyst with Frontier Group, said the National Renewable Energy Laboratory has done substantial research on what a greener grid might look like. He added that other research suggests that a renewable grid has the potential to be more reliable and resilient than our current electric grid, since it would be less vulnerable to central disruptions. Trump said, When the wind stops blowing, thats the end of your electric. In virtually all cases, American energy consumers get their power from an interconnected grid, which pools together a portfolio of different generators. Practically speaking, just because the wind stops blowing in one place does not mean the whole grid goes down. Right now, renewables account for around 17 percent of total U.S. power. Experts say there are some legitimate practical and technological challenges associated with moving to a grid that relies much more heavily on renewable energy than our current system.

African-American kids are unemployed or underemployed to the tune of 51 percent.","During the Univision-Washington Post Democratic presidential debate in Miami, Bernie Sanders highlighted the bleak economic prospects of minority youths. One of the points that I've been making, and media does not seem to pick up on it, is that we have a real crisis not only with real unemployment in America being close to 10 percent, but youth unemployment in this country, Sanders said. If you look at Latino kids between 17 and 20 who graduated high school, 36 percent of them are unemployed or underemployed.  African-American kids are unemployed or underemployed to the tune of 51 percent. We checked a nearly identical statement by Sanders back in July 2015, when Sanders mentioned it at a campaign event in Portland, Maine. Now, eight months later, well revisit it. Well start by noting that the most commonly used unemployment-rate statistic is not as high for each group as Sanders indicated. The most readily available data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics covers the age range from 16 to 19, which isnt identical but gives a quick approximation. For whites in that age range, the official unemployment rate in February 2016 was 13.9 percent, for Hispanics it was 15.6 percent and for African-Americans it was 23.3 percent. In other words, the official unemployment rate shows that African-American youth unemployment is significantly higher than white youth unemployment and, to a lesser extent, higher than Hispanic youth unemployment. Still, the levels for each group are lower than what Sanders said. So whats going on? Sanders camp pointed us to research published in June 2015 by the Economic Policy Institute, a left-of-center think tank. The numbers in the report match what Sanders said at the debate. This data is different from the more familiar measurements for a few reasons. One, the institute didnt just look at employment status for people between the ages of 17 and 20; it limited its reach to high school graduates who were not enrolled in further schooling. And two, EPI counted not only unemployed workers but also those who were working part-time due to the weakness of the economy and those who were marginally attached to the labor force. The latter category includes people who did not meet the strict definition of being in the job market, but werent entirely out of the market, either. The statistic EPI used, known by the wonky shorthand U-6, is officially called a measure of labor underutilization rather than unemployment. EPI itself used the term underemployment in its research. At the Miami debate, Sanders described this statistic accurately, referring to individuals who are unemployed or underemployed. So his statement has merit. However, the data is getting a little stale, and since the employment picture has generally been improving since the middle of last year, thats a potential problem for the accuracy of Sanders statement. The last month analyzed in the EPI study was March 2015. We dont know exactly how much improvement theres been for young, minority, high school graduates since then, because that specific slice of the data isnt readily available on the Bureau of Labor Statistics website. But we can do a quick estimate based on the change in unemployment rates for 16-to-19-year-old Hispanics and African-Americans between March 2015 and February 2016. During that period -- since the EPI report came out -- the unemployment rate for young Hispanics fell from 20.9 percent to 15.6 percent, and for young African-Americans, it fell from 25.1 percent to 23.3 percent. In other words, its quite possible that the unemployment rates for young, minority, high-school grads is lower now than what Sanders stated. We should caution that the unemployment rate for subsets of the population, such as minority groups, tends to be volatile and has a larger margin of error than for the population as a whole. Still, the unemployment rates for these groups do seem to be lower in more recent months. During 2015, the black youth unemployment rate often reached or exceeded 30 percent, making the current rate of 23.3 percent particularly low -- the lowest since 2000, in fact. Similarly, in 2015, the Hispanic youth unemployment rate often reached or exceeded 20 percent, a level well above the current 15.6 percent rate. Our ruling Sanders said that if you look at Latino kids between 17 and 20 who graduated high school, 36 percent of them are unemployed or underemployed.  African-American kids are unemployed or underemployed to the tune of 51 percent. As was the case when we first reviewed this claim last July, Sanders general point is correct -- that in an apples-to-apples comparison, African-American and Hispanic youth have significantly worse prospects in the job market than whites do. But while Sanders had support for this data when he first began using these numbers eight months ago, theres reason to believe that the improving job market has lowered these rates, at least somewhat."
3999,half-true,Bloggers,"Says Cost of Muellers investigation: $3,200,000; Benghazi investigation: $7,000,000; Trumps golfing trips: $83,000,000; New debt from Republican tax bill: $1,500,000,000,000.","A Facebook post claims to offer a cost comparison on different matters of national interest: the special counsels investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election, the Benghazi probe, President Donald Trumps golf outings, and the fiscal impact of the Republican tax law. The clear goal of the meme, based on the items and costs associated, is to discredit Republicans and Trump. Heres the cost breakdown, according to the meme posted on Facebook Dec. 9: Cost of Muellers investigation: $3,200,000 Benghazi investigation: $7,000,000 Trumps golfing trips: $83,000,000 New debt from Republican tax bill: $1,500,000,000,000 The meme adds: Dear Republicans, please spare us your selective outrage about the cost of the Trump-Russia investigation. The post was flagged as part of Facebooks efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The meme includes accurate information, but leaves out critical facts and details. Special Counsel Robert Mueller is investigating Russias interference in the 2016 elections and whether Trumps campaign supported those efforts. Trump has repeatedly denied any collusion with Russia. Its unclear when the meme began circulating, but it was shared on Facebook as recently as Dec. 9, 2018. The investigations first spending report came in December 2017 and showed that from May 2017 through the end of September 2017, Muellers office incurred $3.2 million in direct spending, and $3.5 million in indirect spending, totaling $6.7 million. If the meme relied only on that report, then it omitted from its tally indirect spending costs. Also, the spending didnt stop there. Muellers office released additional spending reports in May 2018 and again in December 2018. The latest information released Dec. 14 shows that since the investigation started in May 2017 through Sept. 30, 2018, direct spending reached $12.3 million and indirect spending $12.9 million, totaling $25.2 million. Thats notably higher than the $3.2 million claimed by the meme. Lawmakers in May 2014 began investigating the 2012 terrorist attack on a U.S. diplomatic compound in Benghazi, Libya, that left four Americans dead. Led mostly by Republicans, critics saw the congressional investigations as a political move against Hillary Clinton, who served as secretary of state when the attack happened. The investigations concluded in 2016, costing about $7 million. The investigations did not suggest that Clinton was personally responsible for or could have prevented the attack. This claim in the meme is more in line with the facts than the claim about the Mueller probe. Trump routinely criticized his predecessor, Barack Obama, for the time he spent golfing. Trump as president has been a regular on the golf course, and that has motivated observers to track his trips to the golf course. (We have our own Trump golf tracker.) The memes source for $83 million is unclear. But Sophie Germain, self-described as a data junkie, runs the website trumpgolfcount.com, which updates its tally after Trump visits a location whose primary offering is golf (i.e., a golf club). The site relies on White House press pool reports. According to trumpgolfcount.com, Trump has made 154 daytime visits to golf clubs since his inauguration, with evidence of playing golf on at least 70 visits, and that has cost taxpayers $84 million. (The sites last recorded outing was Nov. 25, 2018.) It says its cost estimates are based on: • Flights to Trump properties; • Coast Guard protection for Mar-a-Lago (a Trump property in Florida); • Trump's stay at his club and rental of luxury vehicles in Turnberry, Scotland, in July 2018; and • An additional $6.4 million per year, prorated per day at a rate based on money reimbursed so far, allocated to Palm Beach and Bedminster for extraordinary law enforcement personnel costs. While the site has been cited by multiple outlets, our fact-checking friends at the Washington Post found that some of its estimates, particularly the cost of Air Force One flights, may be too high. The Washington Post Fact Checker also questioned whether its fair to attribute all costs of presidential travel and support to a golf outing, since that logistical support follows the president wherever he goes. The Washington Posts July 2018 fact-check also cautioned against the sites then-use of a precise dollar figure for the cost of Trumps golf outings, since its not known exactly how many times Trump has golfed or the precise costs. Trumpgolfcount.com addressed the fact-check on its website, saying: At the time his article was published, our cost estimate was $72,251,706, but (Washington Posts Glenn) Kessler correctly pointed out that since our estimates have a great deal of uncertainty, they shouldn't be stated to the exact dollar. We've updated our site accordingly, and our total cost is now rounded to the nearest million. The meme suggests that its known how much Trumps golfing trips cost, but that figure is uncertain. President Donald Trump in December 2017 signed into law a new tax bill that included significant tax cuts for corporations as well as temporary tax cuts for individuals. The changes in the tax law are projected to increase the federal deficit by at least $1.5 trillion over 10 years. The deficit is the difference between annual government spending and government revenue. Debt is the total amount the government owes.5 trillion tax cut is virtually paid for by higher revenues and better nominal GDP. A Facebook meme says, Cost of Muellers investigation: $3,200,000; Benghazi investigation: $7,000,000; Trumps golfing trips: $83,000,000; New debt from Republican tax bill: $1,500,000,000,000. The meme includes a mix of information thats accurate with information that is incomplete and questionable."
16974,mostly-false,Nikki Fried,"Gov. Ron DeSantis signed a $1 billion tax increase on the people of our state, on our consumers, yet gave a $500 million tax break to our corporations.","Democrat Nikki Fried said Florida has had a history of Republican governors who pass legislation that hurts peoples pocketbooks. Gov. Ron DeSantis recently signed a $1 billion tax increase on the people of our state, on our consumers, yet gave a $500 million tax break to our corporations, Fried told WINK TV. That's not how government is supposed to work. Government is supposed to work for the people. Frieds statement criticizing DeSantis for the tax increase has been a familiar talking point. In a video in April, Fried said, Last night Ron DeSants raised your taxes by over $1 billion. And he did it right before midnight, with no cameras, no one watching. (His press office announced the bill signing in an email at 11:23 p.m.) The state estimated that its new law changing online sales taxes will generate an extra $1 billion per year, bringing Florida in line with the rest of the country. Technically, the online sales tax in Florida isnt new. But practically speaking, it means that Florida online consumers will pay taxes on some purchases they previously didnt. The Florida Legislature passed SB 50 along party lines with Republican support. The new law requires out-of-state retailers and marketplace providers with no physical presence in Florida to collect Floridas sales tax on items delivered to customers in Florida. The rule applies to sellers who generate more than $100,000 in sales in Florida. The bill takes effect July 1. Florida levies a 6% sales and use tax on the sale of goods. Customers are required to pay the state for the tax owed on their purchase of an untaxed item. But hardly any did, according to a legislative staff analysis. A 2018 U.S. Supreme Court decision — South Dakota v. Wayfair — paved the way for more states to collect sales taxes on online purchases. The court eliminated the requirement that a seller have a physical presence in a state to collect and remit sales taxes to that state. Following the ruling, states passed new laws to collect taxes on online purchases. Among states that levy statewide sales taxes, Florida was one of the last few states to pass such a law. In the vast majority of states, the process of updating sales tax statutes post-Wayfair was noncontroversial, in large part because the tax that is being collected is not a new tax; its a tax that was already owed, said Katherine E. Loughead, an analyst at the Tax Foundation. Business groups including Florida TaxWatch and the Florida Retail Federation had urged state legislators to pass such a law so that it applied equally to businesses operating inside and outside Florida that sell to Florida customers. The money from the tax will initially go to replenish the states unemployment trust fund and then later will go toward reducing the commercial rent tax. Jared Walczak, a researcher at the Tax Foundation, estimated that the law will cost online shoppers an added $40 to $50 a year, on average. In 2018 — when Rick Scott was governor — the Florida Legislature set in motion a corporate tax refund following the 2017 passage of the federal Tax Cut and Jobs Act signed by President Donald Trump. That federal law broadened the corporate income tax base by expanding the definition of corporate income while it reduced the corporate income tax rate. Since Florida uses the federal definition of corporate income as the starting point for the state corporate income tax, the federal changes resulted in additional corporate income flowing through to Floridas tax base, Loughead said. If Florida had adopted all the changes in the federal tax bill, it would have increased corporations state tax liabilities. In 2018, the Legislature passed a bill that would lower the corporate income tax rate for one year if net collections in 2018-19 exceeded forecasts by 7%. The bill required that any excess collections be refunded to eligible corporate taxpayers in the spring of 2020. Only about 1% of businesses pay Floridas corporate income tax. Back in 2018, the state didnt know how much money that would add up to — or that Florida would face the economic downturn in 2020 when businesses closed because of the pandemic. So why does Fried imply that the corporate tax refund is the fault of DeSantis, who took office in 2019? In the spring of 2020 amid the pandemic, Democrats asked DeSantis to cancel the refunds, estimated at about $543 million, to save the state money. Refunding $543 million to corporations is a spending decision, and its a bad one at this time, said state Rep. Carlos Guillermo Smith, D-Orlando. It should not be a priority of the leaders of a state that is worrying about how to pay for teachers, health care and transportation needs as our tax collections disappear. But DeSantis remained committed to the corporate refund. The corporate taxpayers who are entitled to receive these automatic tax refunds under the law have anticipated these refunds and have likely made business decisions around them, DeSantis spokesman Ryan Ash told the Orlando Sentinel in March 2020. The refunds, issued in April 2020, benefited 19,546 taxpayers, according to a state Department of Revenue spokesperson. The average benefit was $27,793.49. Fried said DeSantis signed a $1 billion tax increase on the people of our state, on our consumers, yet gave a $500 million tax break to our corporations. In April, DeSantis signed an online sales tax law that the state predicts will generate an extra $1 billion a year. Online shoppers were supposed to be paying these taxes if they were not charged, but hardly any did. Floridas new law puts it in line with other states that have statewide sales taxes. The tax break refers to a bill the state Legislature passed in 2018, before DeSantis was governor, in response to the federal tax law. The bill resulted in refunding corporate taxes above a certain threshold so that their payments would remain roughly the same. Democrats called for DeSantis to cancel the refund, a request he denied. Frieds claims have an element of truth but ignore critical facts that would give a different impression.

9972,mostly-true,Chicago Public Schools,CPS students are learning and growing faster than 96 percent of students in the United States.,"A Nov. 2 press release from Chicago Public Schools touted significant test score gains made in the district over recent years that were included in a high-profile analysis. Students in CPS, according to research from an expert on education equality at Stanford University, improved at a faster rate on standardized test scores between third and eighth grade than their counterparts in most other U.S. school districts. The findings were clearly a plus for the often-maligned CPS, and the district wasted little time advertising them in a press release headlined, CPS students are learning and growing faster than 96 percent of students in the United States. The glow of that phrasing suggests that CPS has not just turned a corner when it comes to educational achievement but is dancing circles around most other school districts in the nation. Reconciling that with the districts problem-plagued reputation merits a closer look. CPS fast-paced gains were assessed in a report prepared recently by Sean Reardon, a professor of education inequality at Stanfords Center for Education Policy Analysis. By comparing Chicago Public Schools students scores on standardized tests to those of students nationally, Reardon found that the scores of CPS students in grades three through eight improved more from 2009-14 than did the average scores of all U.S. students during that time. Reardon used scores from a standardized test all Illinois students are required to take to measure that growth. But because other states rely on different tests to gauge the same thing, he averaged actual scores in math and English across the nation to benchmark proficiency. We define grade level as the average of that grade in the country, Reardon said in a phone interview. The proficiency levels that states set for their tests are defined by groups of experts that say, 'This is what we think a kid should know in this grade.  By Reardons metric, CPS third-graders taking the test in 2014 performed significantly better than did third-graders who sat for it in 2009. The same held true for the other grades covered by the analysis as well. This improvement factored out to about two-thirds of a grade level over the five-year period for CPS, compared to an average increase for the rest of the nation of just one-sixth of a grade level in performance within that timeframe. So far, so good. But Reardons report posed another key question: Improvement aside, how does CPS overall academic performance stack up against the rest of the country? Here, the picture was not as rosy. Third- through eighth-graders in the nations third-largest district still perform at roughly one half to one-and-a-half grade levels below the national average, which the report describes as a significant concern. In short, CPS test scores started low, improved significantly, but remain subpar. Theres no reference to that gut check in the CPS press release highlighting Reardons work, though the release does provide a link to the full report for those so inclined to read it. Indeed, results from the states most recent round of standardized tests point to significant problems at CPS, where only 22 to 30 percent of third- through eighth-graders reached proficiency in core subjects, according to data from the Illinois State Board of Education. A CPS spokesman declined to address questions about the districts characterization of Reardons report. Chicago Public Schools stated that CPS students are learning and growing faster than 96 percent of students in the United States. The claim appears to accurately represent the main conclusion of the Stanford University report from which it was drawn. At the same time, the CPS press release touting the studys findings omits mention of other information contained in the report that provides more context. Test scores among CPS third- through eighth-graders are indeed growing faster on average than the average growth rate in 96 percent of districts nationwide, according to the Stanford study. But the report also found that students in the district, which remains beset by large achievement gaps between students of different racial and socioeconomic groups, still generally perform between one-half and one-and-a-half grade levels below the national average. CPS claim is accurate as far as it goes, but ignores the significant gap in achievement its students still must overcome."
18613,false,Chain email,AIG insures the pension trust of the United States Congress!,"An anonymous e-mail making the rounds claims that Congress has its own selfish reasons for bailing out the insurance company American International Group, better known as AIG. Remember when this economic crisis hit, and Congress let Bear Sterns go under, pushed a bunch of forced marriages between banks, etc.? the e-mail asks.Then they bailed out AIG. At the time, I thought: 'That's strange. What does an insurance company have to do with this crisis?'I think I just found the answer. Among other things, AIG INSURES THE PENSION TRUST OF THE UNITED STATES CONGRESS!! No wonder they got bailed out right away! Note the classic signs of the chain e-mail — all capital letters and LOTS OF EXCLAMATION POINTS!!! But we digress ... To recap the history here, AIG is an insurance company that collapsed in September 2008. Because the firm had so many obligations, the federal government concluded the broader economy could be badly damaged if AIG were simply allowed to go under. So the government gave AIG access to credit to make good on its obligations, more than $150 billion so far. AIG has in turn paid billions to customers such as Goldman Sachs, Merrill Lynch, Bank of America, Citigroup and Wachovia. We looked into the claim that AIG insures the pensions of members of Congress. It's not true — totally bogus, said Mike Orenstein, spokesman for U.S. Office of Personnel Management, which oversees federal pensions. He said he's been asked the question at least three times since the beginning of the year. AIG does sell retirement services like annuities. But it does not insure federal pensions, said AIG spokesman Joseph Norton. Next we turned for confirmation to the National Taxpayers Union, a nonprofit advocacy group that favors lower taxes and smaller government. Neither federal pensions in general nor congressional pensions in particular are insured by any private entity, said Pete Sepp, vice president for policy and communications. The government doesn't need to insure its pensions because the pensions are ultimately paid for by government revenues. That means Congress will get their pensions until the federal government itself goes broke. If that were to happen, we would be a Third World country, he said. The National Taxpayers Union believes this dynamic puts off needed reforms to the Civil Service Retirement System and Social Security, he added. We should add that Congress members do not receive their full salary for life, as some Internet sources suggest. (This year, congressional pay is scheduled to be $174,000 a year, though there is a possibility Congress will reject a recent cost-of-living raise.) Instead, members accrue benefits based on how long they serve. In 2006, the average pension was about $61,000 a year for 20 years of service, according to the Congressional Research Service. If anyone insures congressional pensions, it's U.S. taxpayers, not AIG. The chain e-mail that claims AIG insures congressional pensions is just plain wrong"
