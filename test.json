        "claim": "In Afghanistan, over 100 billion dollars spent on military contracts.",
        "evidence": "The debate over how the United States left Afghanistan, and the chaos it created, will likely last for years. So will the debate over the war itself, and whether nearly 20 years of deployment was worth it. Lt. Gov. Mandela Barnes of Wisconsin, one of at least 10 Democrats hoping to win the seat held by Republican U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson, made his position clear in an Aug. 16, 2021 tweet: Thousands of American lives lost, plus over 100,000 Afghan civilians and military personnel. Over 100 billion dollars spent on military contracts. And for what? The cost in human lives has been well documented. Here are the stark totals as reported that same day by The Associated Press: American service members killed in Afghanistan through April: 2,448. U.S. contractors: 3,846. Afghan national military and police: 66,000. Other allied service members, including from other NATO member states: 1,144. Afghan civilians: 47,245. Taliban and other opposition fighters: 51,191. Aid workers: 444. Journalists: 72. Those casualty totals tragically increased August 26, 2021, when a suicide bomber attacked crowds of Afghans flocking to Kabuls airport. The attacks killed at least 169 Afghans and 13 U.S. troops, Afghan and U.S. officials said. The death toll could rise as authorities examine the scene. On August 30, 2021, the last plane carrying U.S. forces left Afghanistan after 20 years of war. But were focused on the second part of Barnes tweet, and his claim about money spent on military contracts. Has more than $100 billion dollars been spent on military contracts? Lets take a look. When asked for back up for the statement, Barnes spokesman Christian Slater pointed us to a April 23, 2021 Bloomberg Law report which found that Since 2002, the Pentagon has spent $107.9 billion on contracted services in Afghanistan, a Bloomberg Government analysis shows. Contractor support includes lodging, laundry, private security, mechanics, food, transportation, equipment maintenance, and fuel, according to the article. Texas-based Fluor was the biggest defense contractor in Afghanistan. The Defense Department had spent $3.8 billion for Fluors work in Afghanistan since 2015, federal records show, mainly for logistics services, according to an Associated Press report. A Bloomberg report noted that in April 2021, 16,832 workers were employed by contractors in Afghanistan, with 6,147 of them being U.S. citizens. That was more than double the remaining 2,500 U.S. troops at the time. According to a July 21, 2021 US News & World Report article, the number of contractors in Afghanistan dropped over the previous three months from nearly 17,000 in April to 7,800 in July. Here is Bloombergs list of top Department of Defense contractors for fiscal years 2016-2021.  Fluor Corp.: $3.1 billion Amentum Parent Holdings: $1.7 billion Columbia Helicopters: $970 million PAE: $930 million Raytheon Technologies: $830 million Secure Movement Logistics: $680 million National Fuel: $480 million Boeing Co.: $400 million Bravura Information Tech.: $310 million FedEx Corp.: $310 million Waste and fraud reported To be sure, all that money was not spent without controversy -- or even all spent appropriately. In an August 2021 report on Afghanistan Reconstruction, Special Inspector General John F. Sopko, noted that fraud and financial waste was rampant: Because contract work was often performed with little to no oversight, waste and fraud often went virtually unchecked. In 2012, GAO reported that a number of new, contractor- built facilities had to be repaired or completely rebuilt because oversight personnel were unable to adequately measure contractors performance, resulting in wasted resources, low morale, and risks to safety of base and installation personnel where the deficient guard towers, fire stations, and gates were constructed.  Congress created the inspector generals office as an independent agency focused on the Afghanistan mission and its reconstruction issues. Of the approximately $145 billion the U.S. government spent trying to rebuild Afghanistan, about $83 billion went to developing and sustaining its army and police forces, according to the the office. The $145 billion is in addition to $837 billion the United States spent fighting the war, which began with an invasion in October 2001. Barnes said Over 100 billion dollars spent on military contracts. A Bloomberg Law report found that the Pentagon has spent $107.9 billion on contracted services in Afghanistan. Those contracted services include lodging, laundry, food, transportation, equipment maintenance and fuel. For a statement that is accurate with nothing significant missing, our rating is True. "

        "speaker": "Frank Keating",
        "claim": "In the United States, 50 percent of social services are provided by the Catholic church.",
        "evidence": "Former Oklahoma Gov. Frank Keating, a Republican, appeared on NBCs Meet the Press just days after the selection of Cardinal Jorge Mario Bergoglio of Argentina to be the new pope. In praising Pope Francis life of humility, Keating said that judging by his selection, the church was poised to focus on caring for the poor and vulnerable. In his remarks, Keating offered a statistic to demonstrate the depth of the churchs commitment to charity. In the United States, 50 percent of social services are provided by the Catholic church, said Keating, who now serves as president and CEO of the American Bankers Association. Keating did not return an inquiry for this story, nor did Catholic Charities USA, the largest charitable organization run by the Catholic church. We asked a variety of experts on philanthropy whether they had heard this statistic or knew where it came from, but none did. We should start by noting that Catholic charity work is extensive and widely considered a crucial part of the nations social safety net. By itself, Catholic Charities USA, has more than 2,500 local agencies that serve 10 million people annually, said Mary L. Gautier, a senior research associate at the Center for Applied Research in the Apostolate, an institute at Georgetown University that studies the church. And Catholic Charities is supplemented by a panoply of other Catholic-affiliated groups, Gautier said, including St. Vincent De Paul societies, social justice committees, soup kitchens, food pantries, and other similar programs organized independently by thousands of Catholic parishes each year. For a variety of reasons, its difficult to quantify exactly how big Catholic-backed charity is, but we tried our best to sift the data with the help of the National Center for Charitable Statistics, a project of the Urban Institute, a nonpartisan think tank in Washington. The first question we asked is whether the sum of all Catholic-sponsored charity amounts to half of all charitable activity by private groups in the United States. We started with the biggest, Catholic Charities USA, then worked outward. In 2010, Catholic Charities USA reported expenditures of between $4.2 billion and $4.4 billion, according to the Chronicle of Philanthropy, which publishes an annual list of the 400 biggest charities in the United States, ranked by the amount of donations they receive. This enabled it to rank near the top of the 400 list, behind two major social-services charities -- the United Way and the Salvation Army, neither of which is affiliated with the Catholic church. Meanwhile, Catholic News Service has noted a few other Catholic organizations that made the Chronicles annual 400 list, including Father Flanagan Boys Home and Covenant House. This excludes Catholic universities, which mainly provide higher education; hospitals, which are categorized separately from social services; and groups that focus on overseas work. Lets assume that other Catholic groups that didnt crack the top 400 list spent six times what Catholic Charities USA spent, a multiplier that experts we contacted thought was reasonable. That would make the figure about $26 billion. Then if you suppose that the 18,000 Catholic parishes spent an average of $200,000 on the needy every year beyond what they contribute to any of these charitable organizations, a number also considered plausible by our experts, that would add another $3.6 billion to the total. All told, this would equal about $30 billion. So how does that slice compare to the entire pie? National Center for Charitable Statistics researchers tallied up expenditures by nonprofits in the broad category of human services, which includes nutrition, employment assistance, legal aid, housing, disaster relief and youth development. In 2010, the most recent year available, they came up with total expenditures of $168 billion in that category. So by our estimate, Catholic-affiliated charity amounts to 17 percent of the funds spent by nonprofits on social services -- well short of the 50 percent Keating cited. Even doubling this share to create a generous margin of error brings it to 34 percent -- still well short of half. But even this may overestimate the footprint of Catholic-supported charities, since it doesnt include social-service expenditures by the government. In his comment, Keating didnt specify that he was only talking about social services funded by private groups. According to the Congressional Budget Office, federal spending on means-tested programs and tax credits totaled $588 billion in 2012, more than triple what the private sector spent. If you factor in federal spending on these programs, the Catholic share shrinks further, to somewhere in the mid-single digits, depending on how generous your estimate is. Indeed, the government even foots a notable share of the bill for Catholic charitable work through social service contracts. According to NETWORK, a Catholic social-justice lobbying group, the federal government sent more than $1.5 billion to Catholic organizations over a recent two-year period. In 2012, the Economist reported that 62 percent of Catholic Charities support came from local, state and federal government agencies. And indirectly, the government maintains a tax exemption for churches and charities, which enables all religious groups to devote more of their funds to charitable work. Taxpayers who itemize can also deduct their donations to charities, including Catholic ones. Our ruling Keating said, In the United States, 50 percent of social services are provided by the Catholic church. Hes right that Catholic groups are among the biggest providers of social-service charity in the nation, but it doesnt appear that they account for half of all such charity. Were admittedly using a bit of guesswork, but Catholic charity seems to account for 17 percent to 34 percent of all nonprofit social-service charity, depending on how generous an estimate you make. And that share drops to single digits once you factor in the money the federal government spends on means-tested programs."
