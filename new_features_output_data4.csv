Final Rating: True  ",Says fewer than 30 percent of Texas college students graduate in four years and only 58 percent graduate within six years.,"Rick Perry, who has said he wants the 2013 Legislature to impose a four-year tuition freeze for incoming freshmen, said at a Dallas press conference that such a move would give students an economic incentive to graduate on time.Less than 30 percent of our students graduate in four years; only 58 percent of our students have their degrees in six years, Perry said, according to an Oct. 2, 2012, Dallas Morning News news story. That is a system that can and must be improved.He aired a similar claim in a CBS News interview Oct. 10, 2012, saying: One of the problems weve got is that only 30 percent of our college students are graduating in a four-year period of time.We previously explored a similar claim by state Rep. Scott Hochberg, D-Houston, who said in June 2010 that about a third of Texas high school graduates who go to college end up getting through college. His statement rated True; our look also quoted an official from the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board pointing out that 57 percent of Texas students were graduating within six years.Perry spokeswoman Catherine Frazier said the Republican governor drew his figures from the board, and a board spokesman, Dominic Chavez, guided us to the agencys 2012 Higher Education Almanac.A chart in the report says 29.9 percent of Texas students who initially enrolled as full-time students in the states four-year public colleges and universities graduated within four years. It says 58.4 percent of full-time students graduated within six years, with 65.6 percent doing so within 10 years. Fewer part-time students graduated within the time periods.Chavez said by email that the four-year graduation rate of nearly 30 percent reflects 18,396 graduates out of 61,485 full-time students in the fiscal year running through August 2011 who had enrolled as first-time students four years earlier. Notably, he said, the state can track students who switch schools by tracking them using Social Security numbers or another identifier.And the 30 percent rate reflects improvement from the previous decade, Chavez said. By the same measure, nearly 20 percent of fourth-year undergraduates had graduated by August 2000, a rate based on 8,352 graduates among 41,925 fourth-year students.Not only did rate go up, he said, but the number of students increased as well.As noted in our check of Hochbergs statement, two caveats apply. First, the data dont account for students who enrolled in a Texas institution and then transferred out of state. Second, while the enrollment data include students who attended school out of state, the data dont track whether they graduated.Separately, the U.S. Department of Education also gauges college graduation rates by state. In 2009, its latest figures indicate, 48.5 percent of Texas students who had enrolled six years earlier had earned bachelors degrees, compared with 55.5 percent nationally.The same year, 25.4 percent of Texas students who had enrolled three years earlier seeking community college associates degrees had succeeded, compared with 29.2 percent nationally. Based on the raw numbers behind each rate, we reached a combined graduation rate of 38 percent.In contrast to the Texas boards calculation, the federal figures do not account for students who transferred from one institution to another.We asked Patrick Kelly, who works for the agency that oversees the federal graduation figures, to appraise the Texas boards method of calculating graduation rates. This makes sense, he said, calling the approach a straightforward, standard way of tracking students including those who change schools.Our rulingPerry said fewer than 30 percent of Texas college students graduate in four years and only 58 percent graduate within six years. That information is drawn from the states higher education oversight agency.",1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,True

Final Rating: True  ",Says state Senate recall challenger Sandy Pasch voted to cut school aid by nearly $300 million.,"The target in one of the most competitive of Wisconsins nine Senate recall races is state Sen. Alberta Darling, R-River Hills, an architect of a 2011-2013 state budget that reduces aid to public schools by nearly $800 million.But one of the states major political players, the conservative Club for Growth Wisconsin, is turning the tables. It claims Darlings challenger, state Rep. Sandy Pasch, D-Whitefish Bay, also backed a sizable school funding cut.The attack is part of a radio ad that began airing about a week before Pasch won the Democratic primary.Club for Growth, which advocates for limited government and minimal taxation, mostly branded Pasch as a tax-and-spender in the ad. But at one point, the female narrator says Pasch voted to to cut school aid by nearly $300 million.Club for Growth also makes the school aid claim in similar ads that have targeted two other Assembly Democrats who are challenging incumbent Republicans in recall races, according to the La Crosse Tribune.They are Rep. Jennifer Shilling of La Crosse, running against Sen. Dan Kapanke of La Crosse; and Rep. Fred Clark of Baraboo, challenging Luther Olsen of Ripon. Those elections, and the Pasch-Darling contest, are on Aug. 9, 2011.When we asked for evidence to back the claim against Pasch, Club for Growth spokesman R. J. Johnson cited a May 2009 Milwaukee Journal Sentinel article.It referred to the 2009-2011 budget submitted by then-Gov. Jim Doyle, a Democrat, which proposed cutting state aid for schools by $290 million. That was before the Legislature, then controlled by Democrats, voted on the budget.But a month later, Pasch joined all but two Assembly Democrats in approving the spending plan. The final budget cut general school aid by $294 million -- to $9.3 billion -- over two years, according to the nonpartisan Legislative Fiscal Bureau.So, Club for Growth Wisconsin is correct in saying Pasch voted to cut school aid nearly $300 million. But is that whole story?In the same article cited by Club for Growth, Doyle said total spending on public schools would actually rise by about 5 percent because schools would get an additional $877 million in federal stimulus funds. That seemed to indicate that stimulus money would more than offset the state aid reduction. Gillian Morris, Paschs campaign spokeswoman, said that was also her understanding of what happened.But that was not the case.According to the fiscal bureau and the state Department of Public Instruction, the $294 million aid reduction took into account both the cut in state funds and the federal stimulus money that was added in.In other words, the stimulus money was not enough to offset the state funding cut. The net result for schools was a reduction in funding of $294 million.In sum, Club for Growth Wisconsin claimed that Pasch voted to cut nearly $300 million in aid to schools. The record shows the claim was on the mark.",1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,True

Final Rating: True  ",Large majorities of the public oppose major changes to Medicare and favor higher taxes on the wealthy.,"The debate to balance the federal budget and reduce the nation's debt has raged in recent weeks, with Democrats and Republicans arguing about spending, taxes and entitlements such as Medicare.Paul Krugman wrote recently in his New York Times column that a knock-down, drag-out fight may be inevitable, given that the two parties have such different visions for the country.So when pundits call on the parties to sit down together and talk, the obvious question is, what are they supposed to talk about? Wheres the common ground? Krugman wrote.Krugman, who sides with the Democrats over Republicans on budget issues, said the Democrats have a winning case to present to the public.For what its worth, polls suggest that the publics priorities are nothing like those embodied in the Republican budget, Krugman said. Large majorities support higher, not lower, taxes on the wealthy. Large majorities — including a majority of Republicans — also oppose major changes to Medicare. Of course, the poll that matters is the one on Election Day. But thats all the more reason to make the 2012 election a clear choice between visions.We decided to check Krugmans numbers on the polls after a reader asked us to look into it. Lets take the issues one at a time.Large majorities support higher, not lower, taxes on the wealthy.Different polls phrase the question differently, but the bottom line is the same. We found three recent polls that back up Krugmans point.In order to reduce the national debt, would you support or oppose raising taxes on Americans with incomes over 250 thousand dollars a year? Support: 72 percent. Oppose: 27 percent. Unsure: 1 percent. (ABC News/Washington Post Poll. April 14-17, 2011)Do you support or oppose doing each of the following to deal with the federal budget deficit?  Increase taxes on income over $250,000. Support: 64 percent. Oppose: 33 percent. Unsure: 3 percent. (McClatchy-Marist Poll. April 10-14, 2011.)Now looking ahead to next year's federal budget, do you think it should or should not include higher taxes for families with household incomes of $250,000 and above? Should: 59 percent. Should not: 37 percent. Unsure: 4 percent. (USA Today/Gallup Poll. April 11, 2011.)Krugman seems on firm ground here.Large majorities also oppose major changes to Medicare.Again, we found several recent poll questions addressing this point.In order to reduce the national debt, would you support or oppose cutting spending on Medicare, which is the government health insurance program for the elderly? Oppose: 78 percent. Support: 21 percent. Unsure: 1 percent. (ABC News/Washington Post Poll. April 14-17, 2011.)I'm going to read you two statements about the future of the Medicare program. After I read both statements, please tell me which one comes closer to your own view. Medicare should remain as it is today, with a defined set of benefits for people over 65. OR, Medicare should be changed so that people over 65 would receive a check or voucher from the government each year for a fixed amount they can use to shop for their own private health insurance policy. Should remain as is: 65 percent. Should be changed: 34 percent. Unsure: 2 percent. (Also from the ABC News/Washington Post Poll. April 14-17, 2011.)Do you think the government should completely overhaul Medicare to control the cost of the program, make major changes to Medicare but not completely overhaul it, make minor changes to Medicare, or should the government not try to control the costs of Medicare? Not try to control costs: 27 percent. Minor changes: 34 percent. Major changes: 18 percent. Completely overhaul: 13 percent. Unsure: 8 percent. (USA Today/Gallup Poll. April 11, 2011.)In order to reduce the federal budget deficit, would you be willing or not willing to reduce spending on Medicare, the government health insurance program for seniors? Not willing: 76 percent. Willing: 22 percent. Don't know/No answer: 2 percent. (CBS News Poll. March 18-21, 2011.)Do you think it will be necessary to cut spending on Medicare, the federal government health care program for seniors, in order to significantly reduce the federal budget deficit? No: 54 percent. No opinion: 27 percent. Yes: 18 percent. Not sure: 1 percent. (NBC News/Wall Street Journal Poll. Feb. 24-26, 2011.)For each (government program), please tell me if you think significantly cutting the funding is totally acceptable, mostly acceptable, mostly unacceptable, totally unacceptable: Medicare. Totally unacceptable: 46 percent. Mostly unacceptable: 30 percent. Mostly acceptable: 16 percent. Totally acceptable: 7 percent. Unsure: 1 percent. (Also from NBC News/Wall Street Journal Poll. Feb. 24-26, 2011.)Those numbers express widespread opposition to cutting Medicare. And indeed, when the Wall Street Journal reported its results in February, Republican pollster Bill McInturff said the results were a huge flashing yellow sign for Republicans on how much preparation will be needed if they propose to change Social Security and Medicare. As we were working on this report, a new poll was released suggesting that the public might not be so opposed to changes in Medicare. We should note that these results were released publicly after Krugman's column appeared. As explained in the Principles of PolitiFact and the Truth-O-Meter, our rulings are based on the information known at the time the person made the remarks. In order to reduce the budget deficit, it has been proposed that Medicare should be changed from a program in which the government pays doctors and hospitals for treating seniors to a program in which the government helps seniors purchase private health insurance. Would you approve or disapprove of changing Medicare in this way? Approve: 47 percent. Disapprove: 41 percent. Don't Know/No answer: 12 percent. (New York Times/CBS News Poll. April 15-20, 2011.) The New York Times noted in its story that the response was at odds with other recent polls, and concluded that results may vary depending on how the question was asked. When we contacted Krugman for a comment, he noted that the poll came out after his column was published and that it's at odds with the other previous polls. I strongly suspect that the Times result is an outlier -- it looks so different from everything else we're hearing, Krugman said via e-mail. We should note that Krugman parenthetically added that a majority of Republicans also opposed major changes to Medicare. We were not able to find party breakdowns for all of these polls, but the ones we did see showed that Republicans opposed changes to Medicare as well. A CBS News Poll from March showed that 67 percent of Republicans were not willing to reduce spending on Medicare. In the USA Today/Gallup poll, 33 percent of Republicans said the government should not try to control the costs of Medicare, with another 28 percent of Republicans said the government should make only minor changes.Our rulingKrugman said that large majorities support support higher, not lower, taxes on the wealthy, and recent polls support that point. On Medicare, several polls suggest that large majorities, including a majority of Republicans, oppose major changes to the program. One poll, released after Krugman wrote his column, showed an advantage for the Ryan plan. But the preponderance of evidence at the time Krugman made his statement bears him out.",1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,True

Final Rating: True  ","If you look at the hospitalizations at Ruby Memorial in West Virginia, and around the country, 90% to 95% of those hospitalized are unvaccinated.","West Virginia University faculty members held a special meeting on Sept. 1 to begin consideration of a proposal to strengthen the universitys rules on the coronavirus by making vaccines mandatory on campus. During the meeting, one faculty member — Kathryn Moffett Bradford, the division chief of pediatric infectious diseases at WVU's School of Medicine — offered a statistic that she said supported the importance of getting vaccinated for the coronavirus. If you look at the hospitalizations at Ruby Memorial in West Virginia, and around the country, 90% to 95% of those hospitalized are unvaccinated, she said. She was referring to J.W. Ruby Memorial Hospital in Morgantown, W.Va., which is part of WVUs health system. Angela Knopf, director of media relations and public affairs for J.W. Ruby Memorial Hospital, confirmed to PolitiFact West Virginia that at the time the faculty meeting was held on Sept. 1, about 90% to 95% of the patients hospitalized for COVID-19 were unvaccinated. Moreover, Knopfsaid that as of Sept. 13, 2021, fully 100% of the patients in the intensive care unit at Ruby Memorial were unvaccinated. How about the numbers nationally? The share of the unvaccinated in hospitals for COVID-19 is also well above 90%. As of Aug. 2, 2021, more than 164 million people in the United States had been fully vaccinated and, based on reports from 49 U.S. states and territories, there were 7,525 breakthrough cases in which the person was hospitalized or died, according to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, we reported in August. That comes out to less than one-hundredth of 1%. This pattern was borne out by a subsequent study published by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention. Between April 4 to July 17 of 2021, the study found, a bit over 92% of those hospitalized for COVID-19 were not fully vaccinated. That number refers to those who had received their first dose of the vaccine but not their second dose. These numbers also only reflect the 13 U.S. states that were involved in the study, which is about 25% of the U.S. population. Bradford said, If you look at the hospitalizations at Ruby Memorial in West Virginia, and around the country, 90% to 95% of those hospitalized are unvaccinated. Ruby Memorial Hospital confirmed that at the time of her remark, about 90% to 95% of those hospitalized for COVID-19 were unvaccinated. As for the national picture, statistics from the CDC published both before and after her comment broadly support those percentages.

Final Rating: True  ",Says the Senate will have a record number of female senators in 2013.,"In her farewell address to U.S. Senate colleagues, Kay Bailey Hutchison—the first Texas woman in the body—said, Its been a long and wonderful 19-plus years.Hutchison, a Republican, added that while shes leaving the 100-member body, she departs knowing that January will see the greatest number of female senators in our nations history.Is that right?By email, Hutchison spokesman Tom Flanagin pointed out a Bloomberg News article posted online Nov. 7, 2012, opening: Women will occupy a record number of U.S. Senate seats--one in five--in January, following victories in yesterdays balloting.The story says five women, four of them Democrats, won first terms in the Senate, the results meaning that when the new Congress convenes in January 2013, 20 members will be women. Currently, 17 women--which had been the record--serve in the chamber, the story says, adding that Olympia Snowe, R-Maine, and Hutchison are retiring.We harvested historical perspective from a Senate web page listing the 39 women who have served as senators since a 24-hour appointee, Rebecca Latimer Felton of Georgia, took the oath in November 1922.Current female senators, in order of seniority with the most experienced first, are: Barbara Mikulski, D-Md.; Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif.; Barbara Boxer, D-Calif.; Patty Murray, D-Wash.; Hutchison; Snowe; Mary Landrieu, D-La; Susan Collins, R-Maine.; Deborah Stabenow, D-Mich.; Marie E.

Final Rating: True","Six of the 10 richest counties in the United States surround Washington, D.C.","Mike Huckabee says hes found the road to riches, and its called the Capital Beltway. Six of the 10 richest counties in the United States surround Washington, D.C., the GOP presidential candidate said during a Sept. 24 interview on The John Fredericks Show, a Hampton Roads-based radio program. Huckabee, a former Arkansas governor, cited the statistic while contending that federal power brokers have set up a system that shields them from economic hard times. We emailed Huckabees campaign asking for the source of his numbers and didnt hear back. But PolitiFact has examined variations of his statement that have been uttered by three other Republicans: Ohio Rep. Jim Jordan, former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin and, most recently, Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker. The six-of-10 figure is a reference to the counties with the highest median household income, a widely used measure of county-wide wealth. The U.S. Census Bureau compiles the income data each year. Here are the 10 counties with the highest median income in 2013, the latest year for which figures are available: Loudoun County, Va. -- $117,680 Falls Church, Va. -- $117,452 Los Alamos County, N.M. -- $110,930 Fairfax County, Va. -- $110,658 Howard County, Md. -- $108,503 Hunterdon County, N.J -- $107,203 Douglas County, Colo. -- $105,192 Arlington County, Va. -- $101,533 Morris County, N.J. -- $99,950 Montgomery County, Md. -- $97,873 That list includes six counties -- four in Virginia and two in Maryland -- that are located outside Washington. Although Falls Church is a city, its treated as a county by the Census Bureau. We looked at the annual Census Bureau figures going back to 2009. In each of those years, there also were a half-dozen D.C. suburban counties that made the top 10 list of the highest median household income. Its no secret that the federal government is the major seed of affluence in the D.C. area, sprouting high-paying government and contracting jobs. The suburbs have some of the highest education levels in the nation, according to Terry Rephann, a regional economist at the University of Virginias Weldon Cooper Center for Public Service. We should make a statistical note here. Median household income is the midrange point where half of the countys households make more than the median and the other half makes less. For example, if only five families lived in a county, the median income would be that of the third highest-earning household. Not all measures rank the D.C. suburbs among the 10 richest counties. Money magazine, for example, looked at average income -- the total income in a county divided by its residents. Based on that data from 2012, none of the counties near Washington made a Money list of the 10 richest counties published last year. If youre wondering, No. 1 in was Teton County in Wyoming. Rephann, however, told us that average income can easily be thrown off by a few extremely wealthy people living in a less populous rural county. Median income is a better way to measure the richest counties, he said. Well also note that while median incomes are high around Washington, that doesnt mean everything is rosy there. Economists told us for a recent fact-check that the Virginia economy has taken a hit in recent years amid federal budget-cutting in D.C. Our ruling Huckabee said six of the 10 richest counties in the United States surround Washington, D.C. Judged by median household income -- a standard way for tracking a countys wealth -- his statement is correct.",1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,True

Final Rating: True  ",Medicaid is the primary source of health insurance for 41.7 percent of Hispanic children in Georgia.,"In a recent broadcast, WABE-FM (90.1) led into a story on the impact of proposed deficit-cutting measures with a shocking number.Forty-one point seven percent of Latino children in Georgia rely on Medicaid programs for health care, the reporter said, before cutting to tape of Jennifer Ngandu, deputy director of health policy for the National Council of La Raza, a Hispanic advocacy group.Ngandu said a Republican-led proposal in Congress to cut the deficit, in part with $1.4 trillion in cuts to Medicaid over 10 years, would have disproportionate effect on Hispanics because they are more likely to rely on taxpayer-funded health care.That figure – 41.7 percent – is eye-popping. We wondered if it was accurate. The number comes from La Razas report The Meaning of Medicaid: A State-by-State Breakdown, recently released as a rebuttal to the GOP plan.It turns out the nexus here is between race or ethnicity and poverty.More than a quarter of Hispanics in the United States live in poverty, according to the U.S. census. The poverty rate has gotten worse in recent years for everybody, but Hispanics and blacks have the higher percentages of their ranks among the poor.The census figures do not delve into immigration status -- whether someone is here legally or illegally. Some critics of illegal immigration contend that U.S. taxpayers should not be liable for the medical costs of anyone in the country illegally. This fact-check makes no attempt to wade into that controversy.Children – defined by the census as people under 18 – also are more likely to be in poverty than any other age category. The most recent figures indicate 20.7 percent of young people meet the federal definition of poverty.Census figures tie together poverty and a lack of insurance.The percentage of all people without insurance rose from 15.4 percent in 2008 to 16.7 percent in 2009, according to a report released late last year. Thats 50.7 million people without insurance.Broken down by race or ethnicity, the census calculates that 32.4 percent of Hispanics are uninsured. Thats significantly higher than blacks (21 percent), Asians (17.2 percent) or whites (12 percent).Not surprisingly, income affects insurance rates. Nearly 27 percent of people making $25,000 a year or less are uninsured, according to the census.So, the poor are more likely to be uninsured and Latinos are more likely to be uninsured. But is the number correct?We contacted the Kaiser Family Foundation, which acts as a clearinghouse for health-related data, to see if the figure quoted for Georgia is correct. According to foundation spokesman Chris Lee, it checks out – or comes very close.Lee said the figure they came up with is 41 percent even, using a three-year average of census data.Ngandu said La Raza used the same source to get its figure. In terms of raw numbers, thats about 120,000 Latino children in the state relying on Medicaid for health care.Medicaid is a federal program administered -- and jointly funded -- by the states that provides medical care to low-income people and the disabled, although eligibility varies by state. It covers a wide range of health-related costs, from doctors visits to nursing home care.Nationally, the states and federal government put about $339 billion into Medicaid, with the federal government picking up 57 percent of the total cost, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation.The program costs Georgia $1.7 billion, and that figure is expected to climb with a planned federal expansion of the program that would add an estimated 650,000 people in 2014. The Kaiser Family Foundation estimates the additional costs to be around $714 million, while the governors office has projected the cost of the expansion at $2.5 billion over the next decade.Currently, about one in six Georgia residents is enrolled in Medicaid, and most of those are children. La Raza is highlighting the high percentage of Latino children on the Medicaid rolls as an argument against cutting the program to lower the federal deficit.Thats a subject for political debate, not PolitiFact. For the purposes of this fact-check, the number in the WABE broadcast appears to be on target.",1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,True

Final Rating: True  ",Texas leads the nation in the percentage of residents without health insurance.,"In a Jan. 6 New York Times op-ed column, liberal economist Paul Krugman warns that Texas is the future, and it isnt pretty: What were seeing right now is a future that doesnt work. Among his charges is that Texas is leading the nation in the percentage of residents without health insurance, the column says.  Texas has so long been cited as the state with the highest percentage of uninsured residents that factual corroboration seldom follows. When we asked Krugman for backup, he pointed us to 2007-2009 data from the U.S. Census Bureau comparing the percentage of uninsured residents between states. According to to the bureaus estimates, Texas ranked first at that time, with 25.5 percent uninsured. New Mexico followed, with 22.6 percent, and then Florida, 20.9. Nationally, 15.8 percent were uninsured, according to the data, with Massachusetts having the fewest uninsured, 5.1 percent.  An October 2008 policy paper by the conservative Texas Public Policy Foundation notes that Texas has the unfortunate distinction of leading the nation in the number of uninsured citizens, but takes issue with the Census Bureaus methodology, which includes anyone uninsured at the time the survey is taken.  Separately, we found a national poll indicating Texas ranked No. 1 in uninsured residents the first half of 2010. According to the Gallup poll, an average of 26.8 percent of Texas residents were uninsured. Mississippi trailed in second (25.8 percent), followed by Louisiana (24 percent). California landed fifth, with 21.9 percent.

Final Rating: True  ","Currently, 23 percent of our military's infrastructure is graded as 'poor' while 9 percent is 'failing.'","North Carolinas 3rd Congressional District, in the eastern part of the state, is home to several military bases, including Camp Lejeune, New River and Cherry Point. So its no surprise that, with a special election for the U.S. House heating up, the candidates in the primary are talking a lot about the military. We also need to adequately provide for our military families via increased infrastructure projects, said Democrat Allen Thomas in a pre-election candidate questionnaire with the Jacksonville Daily News. Currently, 23 percent of our militarys infrastructure is graded as poor while 9 percent is failing. We wondered if Thomas had his numbers straight, so we decided to put his claim to the Truth-O-Meter. It turns out hes correct. Thomas did not respond to requests for comment, but he likely got his statistics from a budget request that Lucian Niemeyer, assistant secretary of defense for energy, installations and environment, provided to the House Committee on Armed Services on April 18, 2018. Noting that the Department of Defense needs a steady flow of investment to keep its bases in good condition, Niemeyer requested more money for the 2019 fiscal year to compensate for low funding in past years. As a result of limited investments in previous budgets for facilities sustainment and recapitalization, 23 percent of the Departments facility inventory is in poor condition  and another 9 percent is in failing condition, Niemeyer said in prepared testimony. Infrastructure is a broad term. In this context, it seems to refer primarily to the buildings on military bases. Pentagon spokeswoman Heather Babb confirmed the numbers in the budget request are accurate. For what its worth, the DOD budget President Donald Trump ultimately proposed for 2019 was more than $686 billion, with about $10.8 billion devoted to maintenance and repair for facilities. Thomas said, Currently, 23 percent of our militarys infrastructure is graded as poor while 9 percent is failing. These numbers are in line with what the Department of Defense reported to Congress last year.

Final Rating: True",Says people convicted of felonies or under restraining orders can buy a firearm without going through a background check.,"Gun control is yet again — tragically — up for debate in Wisconsin. After mass shootings at an El Paso Walmart and a Dayton, Ohio, entertainment district left 31 dead, Wisconsin leaders have raised questions about loopholes in state law. Democratic lawmakers introduced legislation in August 2019 that would require background checks for nearly all gun sales. Gov. Tony Evers, a fellow Democrat, has threatened to call a special session on the matter if Republican legislative leaders dont take up the bill. This comes as 80% of state residents support universal background checks — including 75% of gun owners — according to a Marquette University Law School Poll conducted in mid-August. So how is that different from what Wisconsin has now? The states Democratic attorney general offered an example. Because we dont have universal background checks, people who are a danger to others — including people who have been convicted of a dangerous felony or are subject to a domestic violence restraining order — currently can buy a firearm without going through a background check, Josh Kaul said in an Aug. 15, 2019, tweet. State Sen. Jennifer Shilling, D-LaCrosse, raised the same point with a tweet earlier that day. Can someone in those circumstances really purchase a gun without a background check? A convicted felon, or someone with an active restraining order connected to domestic violence, would not pass a criminal background check to qualify for a firearm purchase. Such background checks are required under federal law for any purchase of a firearm from a Federal Firearm Licenses dealer — which would include any retailers or others engaged in gun sales as a profession. In Wisconsin, the state Department of Justice handles background checks for handgun sales, while long gun sales go through the National Criminal Background Check Systems, said DOJ spokeswoman Gillian Drummond. This two-pronged system covers the vast majority of firearm purchases in the state, Kaul said in anAug. 9, 2019, appearance on Wisconsin Public Televisions Here and Now. This is the process gun rights advocates refer to when noting background checks already exist. But its not the only way to buy a gun. A 2015 study found 22% of gun owners bought their most recent firearm without going through a background check. Thats because gun sales in Wisconsin between private parties (those without a federal firearms license) arent subject to reporting, waiting period or background check requirements. The U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives does not regulate private sales as it does those involving dealers. And Wisconsin is one of 29 states that does not impose any state-level regulations either, according to the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence, a research and advocacy organization that seeks laws, policies, and programs proven to save lives from gun violence. Websites such as Armslist — a Craigslist-style firearms marketplace — connect private sellers and are heavily used. A search in September 2019 showed more than 2,000 firearms for sale from private parties in Wisconsin.  Two guns used in high-profile shootings here were purchased through Armslist by people under court orders not to possess guns. In October 2012, Radcliffe Haughton killed three people including his estranged wife and injured four others, before killing himself at Azana Salon & Spa in Brookfield. A day before the shooting he purchased a .40-caliber handgun in the parking lot of a Germantown McDonalds after connecting with the seller on Armslist. Two days before that, a judge had issued a restraining order that barred Haughton from owning a gun. In January 2018, Robert Schmidt bought a Glock 9 mm handgun from a 19-year-old man through Armslist, days after he was released from the Calumet County jail on a bond that prohibited him from having a gun. The transaction took place in a Walmart parking lot. Schmidtwas charged at the time with raping his wife at gunpoint. The next night he used that gun tokill his wife and then himself at a home just outside Appleton. Kaul said felons and people subject to domestic abuse restraining orders are currently able to buy guns in Wisconsin without going through a background check. All purchases from firearms dealers are subject to state and federal requirements that include a criminal background check. But Kaul is right that Wisconsin is among the states with no oversight of gun sales between private parties. That has allowed people in the circumstances he described to buy guns, in some cases with tragic results.",1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,True

Final Rating: True  ",Says Paul Ryan is still endorsing Trump.,"One of the most vexing quandaries for Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan in 2016 has been whether, and how, to support the GOPs presidential nominee. Finally, a month from election day, Ryan somewhat reluctantly agreed to make his first public appearance with Donald Trump, at a political rally in his southern Wisconsin district. But on the day before rally, a videotape of Trump talking crassly about women surfaced. In the 2005 video, Trump is caught on a live microphone saying I did try and f--- her. She was married. He also uses graphic terms to describe the womans body and says he frequently tries to kiss beautiful women and even grab their genitals. Ryan denounced Trump and said Trump would not be attending the rally. Three days after the videos release, on Oct. 10, 2016, Ryan went further, declaring to fellow Republican House members he would not defend Trump, and instead focus on maintaining the GOPs majority in the House. So, we wondered about a tweet issued the same day by Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton. She claimed: Ryan is still endorsing Trump. Ryans position Ryans dilemma on supporting Trump was evident in May 2016, when we tested him on our Flip-O-Meter, which is used to see whether a politician has changed positions. We gave Ryan a Half Flip. At the time, just after Trump became the presumptive GOP nominee with a win in Indianas primary, Ryan had said repeatedly he would support for president whomever won the Republican nomination. He said so even when asked specifically about Trump. Yet in his first comments after Trump won in Indiana, Ryan wavered. He did not say he would not support Trump. But he stated he was not ready to support him at that time. Then in June 2016, a month before Trump won the nomination, Ryan endorsed him, saying: It's no secret that he and I have our differences. I won't pretend otherwise. And when I feel the need to, I'll continue to speak my mind. But the reality is, on the issues that make up our agenda, we have more common ground than disagreement. Clintons claim Early on Oct. 10, 2016, Politico reported that, according to sources, Ryan was discussing whether to revoke his Trump endorsement. Clinton sent her tweet several hours later, after Ryan held a private conference call with House Republicans that was later discussed publicly. Clintons campaign cited to us a same-day blog post from the Los Angeles Times about the call. The post was headlined: House Speaker Paul Ryan will not campaign with Trump, but still endorses him. Other news accounts on the conference call were similar. The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel stated Ryan stopped short of rescinding his own tepid endorsement of Trump, and quoted a Ryan aide as saying there is no update in his position on Trump at this time. The New York Times and ABC News said Ryan responded to criticism for not supporting Trump more by emphasizing that he wasn't withdrawing his endorsement. As for Ryan himself, when we asked his campaign about Clintons claim, a spokesman simply reiterated what had been put out earlier, saying: There is no update in his position at this time. Our rating Clinton says Ryan is still endorsing Trump. As of the time when Clinton made the claim, Ryans endorsement of Trump for president remained in place. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/82b74708-0ee4-414b-9fb4-437544a96b41",1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,True

Final Rating: True  ",(Ronald Reagan) raised taxes a billion dollars in his first year as governor of California.,"As the candidates fell over themselves in a game of I-loved-Ronald Reagan one-upsmanship during a Jan. 10, 2008, debate in South Carolina, Mike Huckabee had the audacity to note that in Reagan's first year as governor of California, the Gipper raised taxes. A lot. You know, if Ronald Reagan were running tonight, there would be ads by the Club for Growth running against him because he raised taxes a billion dollars in his first year as governor of California, Huckabee said. It would be $10-billion today. Ronald Send the welfare bums back to work Reagan? Basically, yeah, said Kelly Barton, an archivist at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in Simi Valley, Calif. In the summer of 1967, during Reagan's first year as governor, and contrary to his campaign promises, Reagan signed off on a record tax increase for the state of California — an 18 percent, roughly $1-billion hike. According to Reagan biographer Lou Cannon, the increase included boosting sales taxes from three to five cents on the dollar; raising the maximum income tax from 7 to 10 percent; and increases in bank, corporation, inheritance, liquor and cigarette taxes. A little context is in order. In his autobiography,An American Life,Reagan said he inherited a $200-million deficit from his predecessor, Pat Brown. Reagan ordered a hiring freeze and other spending cuts. But Reagan was a Republican governor in a state where the legislature was controlled by the Democrats, and he wasn't able to muster support for additional cuts. So, he ended up reluctantly signing off on the tax increases. This is the second time in week that a Republican candidate has used Reagan to defend himself. In a debate on Jan. 5, 2008, Rudy Giuliani correctly pointed out that Reagan had endorsed a policy of amnesty for some illegal aliens. Read our rulinghere. Now, Huckabee's math may be a little off on what that $1-billion would translate to today. It's actually closer to $6.3-billion. But the bottom line, Huckabee's statement about Reagan is true.

Final Rating: Half True  ",Says he's signed a pledge not to raise taxes four times.,"U.S. Senate hopeful Roger Williams stressed his opposition to higher taxes during a June 8 candidate forum presented by the Texas Tribune and KLRU-TV, saying: I've signed that pledge four times. The idea of raising taxes any time, but certainly at a time of economic slowdown, is nuts.Williams, a Republican, is making his first bid for elected office, so his comment seemed a head-scratcher. How many no-tax pledges can one candidate sign?On behalf of Williams, campaign spokesman Colby Hale told us Williams has twice signed no-tax pledges from Americans for Tax Reform, has signed the American Family Business Institute no death tax pledge and, Hale said he believes, a few different Tea Party (no-tax) pledges at various rallies. Hale said he thinks Williams also signed a No Climate Tax pledge for Americans for Prosperity.We checked his list.By email, Patrick Gleason of Washington-based Americans for Tax Reform said Williams signed its pledge Feb. 9 and once before then. The pledge says the individual will oppose any and all efforts to increase the marginal income tax rates for individuals and/or businesses and also will oppose any net reduction or elimination of deductions and credits, unless matched dollar for dollar by further reducing tax rates.The American Family Business Institute forwarded a copy of the Death Tax Repeal Pledge signed by Williams May 10. It states the signers will support the permanent repeal of the federal estate and gift taxes. Spokesman Adam Nicholson said by email that Williams also signed the pledge earlier because the group asks candidates to sign for each election cycle. Last year, Williams was among candidates geared up to run for U.S. Senator Kay Bailey Hutchisons seat when she said she was considering stepping down to run for governor.Later, Williams campaign forwarded a copy of the no-climate tax pledge -- avowing opposition to any climate-change legislation that includes a net increase in government revenue -- signed by Williams on Feb. 14.So, Williams has signed at least three anti-tax pledges--two of them twice.",0.5,0.5,1,0.5,0,0,0.5,1,0.5,Half True

John McCain believesRoe vs. Wadeis a flawed decision that must be overturned, and as president he will nominate judges who understand that courts should not be in the business of legislating from the bench, the Web site states.

Final Rating: Mostly True  ",Rhode Island continues to have the highest rates of substance abuse in the country.,"When state lawmakers this year took up legislation to create a high school program in Rhode Island for teens in recovery, they heard sobering testimony from the head of the agency that would run it.Ian Lang, chief strategy officer of The Providence Center, a provider of mental-health and substance-abuse services, painted a disturbing portrait of addiction problems in Rhode Island.Rhode Island continues to have the highest rates of substance abuse in the country, he told members of the Senate Education Committee while describing plans to locate the small school in one wing of the centers building on Hope Street.Do we really have such a serious substance abuse problem?In his remarks, Lang cited statistics from the National Survey on Drug Use and Health. Its sponsor, the U.S. Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, says the survey is the primary source of statistical information on the use of illegal drugs, alcohol, and tobacco by the U.S. civilian, non-institutionalized population aged 12 or older.The survey, begun in 1971, is conducted in door-to-door interviews with a representative sample of the nations population. About 900 people in Rhode Island respond annually to the questionnaire, parts of which are administered confidentially with computers.Lang, citing survey estimates, testified that over 11 percent of Rhode Islanders 12 and over use illicit drugs, the highest rate in the nation, and that Rhode Island has the highest percentage of persons 12 years and over needing but not receiving treatment for illicit drug use, at 3.3 percent. We also have the lowest perceived risk of substance abuse in the country, according to national statistics.When we contacted Lang to discuss the survey results, he did some checking and realized he had actually cited old data. The most recent state-by-state comparison is based on the 2007-2008 surveys. (The federal agency is a couple years behind and will release 2009 data later this year, a spokeswoman said.) Still, Lang said, Rhode Island continues to have among the worst substance-abuse rates in the nation.I think a lot of it has to do with the location... between Boston and New York and the easy availability of drugs and the urban environment we live in, he said. Its a lot easier to get around here than if you were in the middle of nowhere....If you look at our sister states, its not just a problem in Rhode Island, its a problem in the Northeast, Lang said.We decided to check the survey results ourselves. They turned out to be far more complex than we imagined. And troubling.To begin with, states are not ranked individually. Instead, they are grouped into one of five quintiles. So when Lang says Rhode Islands rates are the highest in the nation, hes using the survey definition, which is falling among the 10 worst states in any particular category.We found that Rhode Island not only landed among the worst states in one category Lang cited -- the percentage of those 12 and over who have used illicit drugs in the past month -- we actually had the highest individual score. Rhode Islands rate was 13.3 percent. (Oregon was second, at 12.1 percent.)We wondered why Lang would select everyone 12 and over instead of focusing on the population that would be served by the recovery high school. The survey, after all, includes a category for youths ages 12 to 17. So how does Rhode Island rank in that category? Still in the highest fifth and, according to our review, second of all states, at 12.4 percent. (Vermont is highest, at 13 percent.)Lang also cited survey estimates of how many people in Rhode Island need treatment for substance abuse, but arent getting it. For ages 12 and up, Rhode Island was in the highest group (ranking second at 3.9 percent). Again, we checked the rate for those ages 12 to 17, and the state remained in the top fifth, in sixth place at 4.9 percent.Lang also highlighted the studys examination of attitudes in Rhode Island toward drug use, namely whether people consider monthly marijuana use and weekly binge drinking to be risky. The numbers generally indicate our state is more accepting than others of such behavior.We decided to look into two areas of the survey that Lang didnt mention, and turned up more troubling statistics. Turns out that Rhode Island topped all states for marijuana use for all age groups: an estimated 10.9 percent of residents 12 and older had used marijuana in the month prior to the survey. It also was tops for alcohol consumption by youth, including binge drinking.Finally, we wondered whether the National Survey Lang cited is really the most authoritative. We put that question to Robert Morrison, executive director of the National Association of State Alcohol/Drug Abuse Directors.The national survey on drug use and health is one of the most widely used surveys in the country to get a picture of substance abuse in the nation, he told us.In summary, the federal study Lang relied upon has a 40-year history and the statistics he cited were accurate. And when we delved into a variety of other categories from the same survey, we found that in many instances, Rhode Island has the highest rates of substance abuse in the country -- an alarming distinction.(Get updates from PolitiFactRI on Twitter.

Final Rating: Mostly True  ",Nine million people have lower-cost HIV/AIDS medicine because of the work of the Clinton Foundation and my husband.,"The Clinton Foundation might be committed to doing good around the world, but Hillary Clintons critics see it as a ripe target to bring down the presumptive Democratic nominee. Republican Donald Trump recently charged that some countries who gave money to the foundation received favorable treatment in return. For anyone who hasnt heard about the Clinton Foundation, its the signature project to reduce poverty and improve global health created by former President Bill Clinton. It is part matchmaker, helping wealthy donors connect with doers, and part active participant, directly running programs, especially in health care. In an interview with Hillary Clinton, CNNs Anderson Cooper quoted Trump and asked if her husband would break all ties with the foundation, should she become president. Clinton said she would cross that bridge if we come to it, and proceeded to give a full-throated defense of the foundation. I'm proud of the work that it has done, Clinton said in the June 8, 2016, interview. Nine million people have lower-cost HIV/AIDS medicine because of the work of the Clinton Foundation and my husband. We have women across the country, from Latin America and Africa -- across the world, I mean -- getting good jobs, and being able to support themselves for the first time. Well focus on the first part of that statement and explore if the Clinton Foundation actually had a hand in making HIV/AIDS drugs more affordable for 9 million people? The foundations work on HIV/AIDS treatment dates back to 2002 with the creation of the Clinton Health Access Initiative. That was a time when some countries were paying $1,000 or more to treat each AIDS patient. The basic goal was to bring in bulk-buying to lower costs. The program consolidated both the supply of raw materials to make the drugs and the bidding to supply the finished product. The result was lower production costs and lower drug prices. Today, the initiative tracks the going price for a menu of treatments and posts them to help health departments around the world as they negotiate with drug companies. In 2014, the World Health Organization reported that by the end of 2013, more than 11.7 million people were on antiretroviral therapy in low- and middle-income countries. While the kinds of drugs have changed, the WHO said in the past decade the price of individual antiretroviral formulations has decreased considerably. The treatments used in the early days have fallen from a median cost of about $600 in 2003 to about $100 a decade later. A more advanced drug combination introduced in 2005 saw a similar decline. Importantly, the WHO listed the Clinton Health Access Initiative as one of a handful of organizations collaborating on ensuring a steady supply of drugs. The partners in that effort include the biggest players, including several United Nations agencies, PEPFAR (the Presidents Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief) and UNITAID, a project created by Brazil, Chile, France, Norway and the United Kingdom. UNAIDS announced at the end of May that the number of people under treatment is now closer to 17 million. Technically, the Clinton Health Access Initiative has been a separate nonprofit since 2010, but it is still integrated within the Clinton Foundation and the foundation press office still offers comments on its behalf. Clinton Health Access Initiativespokeswoman Maura Daley told us that Clinton used an old figure for the people being served by the initiative. The total number of patients benefitting is 11.8 million, she told us. Not everyone getting treatment is counted as benefiting from the initiatives efforts. Beyond working to reduce drug costs, it also coordinates with nongovernmental organizations inside countries to distribute the drugs once they arrive. Clearly, the Clinton Health Access Initiative did not accomplish all of this on its own, but Clinton didnt say that. Two experts in HIV/AIDS treatment, Jennifer Kates at the Kaiser Family Foundation, and Ellen t Hoen call the initiative an important player. t Hoen was the first executive director of the Medicines Patent Pool, a group that streamlines the production of generic antiretroviral drugs. Without the work of the MPP it would have been much harder for organizations like CHAI to access generic antiretrovirals, she said. The initiative has been faulted for failing to fully report donations from foreign governmentsand has filed amended returns for 2012 and 2013. Our ruling Clinton said 9 million people have lower-cost HIV/AIDS medicine thanks to the efforts of the Clinton Foundation and her husband. Bill Clinton started the foundation and its first big project was the Clinton Health Access Initiative. The program focused on using market mechanisms to reduce treatment costs. Costs have fallen dramatically and the initiative remains a key global player in maintaining a steady supply of affordable drugs. If anything, Clinton understated the number of people who have benefited from the program. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/037cffe5-607a-4a13-9fe8-a78567e75857",1.0,0.0,1.0,0.8,0.0,0.0,0.3,1.0,1.0,Mostly True

Final Rating: True  ",Georgia is the second-fastest growing state for international tourists.,"Who needs the Statue of Liberty to draw tourists when you have the Big Chicken?Georgias new economic development commissioner, Chris Cummiskey, surprised us when he made this claim during a recent state budget hearing:We are the second-fastest-growing state for international tourists.Virginia, the commissioner said, is first.So Georgia had a greater increase in international tourists than New York, home to Broadway, Lady Liberty and the amazing Manhattan skyline? The Peach States tourism market is growing faster than the market in California, the land of Hollywood and Disneyland? Georgia is ahead of Florida, where you can sunbathe in February on South Beach?Really?AJC PolitiFact Georgia went searching for answers.Georgia Economic Development Department spokeswoman Alison Tyrer directed us to a 2009 study by the federal government about international tourism broken down by each state. In 2008, an estimated 634,000 international tourists came to Georgia, according to the U.S. Department of Commerces International Trade Administration. About 689,000 international tourists visited the Peach State the following year, the federal agency reported. Thats nearly a 9 percent increase. A survey examining international tourism in 2010 has not been done yet, the ITA said.The top markets for international tourists who visited Georgia were the United Kingdom, Germany, the Caribbean, the Netherlands, France and Brazil, according to an ITA spokeswoman. In Atlanta, the tourists like to go to attractions such as the Georgia Aquarium. They also enjoy the Georgia coastline and are curious about the states antebellum architecture.Virginia had a 16 percent increase, according to the study. New York, Florida, California, Nevada and Hawaii ranked first through fifth in the number of international tourists, but only two of those five states (Florida and Hawaii) actually had more international tourists in 2009 than 2008, the ITA found. Hawaii had a 2 percent increase, while the number of international tourists who visited Florida increased by 1 percent.The ITA report found Atlanta had the greatest percentage increase of international tourists of the nations top 20 markets.Georgia is well-known as a state that hosts many conventions. But we also know Georgia has Atlantas Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport, the worlds busiest airport. So we wondered, perhaps, if these tourists were visiting the area overnight and whether the ITAs numbers were deceptive. An ITA spokeswoman said the agency did not have specific data for how long people stayed in Georgia. An Atlanta Convention and Visitors Bureau spokeswoman said the average tourist stays in Atlanta about two or three days.So whats bringing these international tourists to Georgia? Cory Churches, the ITA spokeswoman, believes part of the explanation may be the merger of Delta Air Lines with Northwest Airlines in 2008.Delta Air Lines has been enhancing its ATL [Atlanta] hub presence, including international routes, since the merger with Northwest, Churches said.Delta has been eager to have more international flights, said Lauren Jarrell, the communications director for the Atlanta Convention and Visitors Bureau. The Atlanta Journal-Constitution has reported Deltas desire to have 50 percent of its business be the more lucrative international flights. Jarrell said more conventioneers are coming from outside the country.

Final Rating: True  ",Says that the new financial services law requires 358 regulatory filings.,"The morning after Republicans won House of Representatives control in last weeks elections, soon-to-be House Speaker John Boehner of Ohio held a news conference where he outlined upcoming GOP priorities for the next Congress.How about those tax cuts implemented under President Bush? He wants to keep em!What about the health care reform bill adopted under President Obama? He wants it repealed!The congressman from West Chester was more circumspect when asked about potential changes to a financial services reform package adopted earlier this year, promising merely to exercise oversight over its implementation.The law, signed by Obama in July, established an independent consumer bureau within the Federal Reserve to protect borrowers against abuses in mortgage, credit card and some other types of lending. It also gave government new power to seize and shut down large, troubled financial companies.I think when it comes to the financial services bill and the 358 regulatory filings required under that bill, that its going to require a significant amount of oversight, so that not only will Congress understand, but the American people will understand, just what this bill will do to our financial services industry, Boehner answered.That sounded like an awful lot of regulatory filings, so we asked Boehners office where his statistic came from. Staffers pointed to a U.S. Chamber of Commerce websitethat expresses the groups dismay with the legislation:The Financial Regulatory Reform bill doesn't address the core causes of the financial crisis, it says. Instead, it adds new regulatory agencies to the already antiquated system and grows a bloated, ineffective bureaucracy while leaving critical areas unaddressed, including the future of Freddie and Fannie. The real impact of the bill will depend on its implementation. The legislation requires regulators to issue at least 355 new rules and conduct 47 studies and 74 reports that could lead to additional rules.Thats not exactly Boehners number, but its close enough.A July 15 news release from the Chamber goes even further, citing a study that says the bill creates 533 required regulatory rulemakings, 60 studies, and 93 reports.A spokesman for Senate Banking Committee chairman Chris Dodd of Connecticut confirmed the bill imposes more regulation on Wall Street, but said the committee has not tallied up the exact number. He didnt dispute Boehners statistics..These regulations are long overdue, said Dodd spokesman Sam Gilford. The financial crisis occurred because there were gaps in the regulations.Democrats cite a recent Gallup Poll to explain why Boehner said hed exercise oversight over the financial services bill rather than seek its repeal. The poll found that six in 10 Americans approve of the legislation, in contrast to the majority that disapprove of 2009 economic stimulus package, the auto industry bailout, health care reform, and -- most of all -- the 2008 banking industry bailout.So, while Boehners 358 might not be right on the money, his underlying point is correct. The new law does create a lot of new regulations for the financial services industry.We find Boehners statement to be True.",1.0,0.0,1.0,0.9,0.0,0.1,0.2,1.0,1.0,True

Final Rating: True  ","Under the compromise tax agreement, 99.7% of American families will not pay 1 nickel in an estate tax.","While the debate over the compromise tax agreement proposed by President Barack Obama has focused mostly on Bush's income tax cuts and whether they ought to be extended to wealthy Americans, the issue of estate taxes has also become a sticking point for some legislators.Under the plan, the estate tax rate would be set at 35 percent, with an effective exemption of $5 million.Many Republicans had hoped to do away with the estate tax altogether, and Democrats last year had proposed a higher rate: 45 percent on the value of estates over $3.5 million.The compromise has ruffled feathers on both sides of the aisle. Sen. Jim DeMint, R.-S.C., for example, said he would not support the plan because he considered the estate tax compromise a tax increase. We ruled that claim Barely True.Meanwhile, Sen. Bernie Sanders, an independent from Vermont and a self-described democratic socialist, sent out a message via Twitter on Dec. 13, 2010, saying that under the estate tax plan, 99.7% of American families will not pay 1 nickel in an estate tax. This is not a tax on the rich, this is a tax on the very, very, very rich.According to an analysis by the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center, Sanders is correct.The Tax Policy Center estimated that about 99.7 percent of estates were exempt from the estate tax in 2009 when the first $3.5 million of an estate was exempt. Even fewer people would be subject to the tax if the threshold is increased to $5 million, as proposed in the compromise tax plan.Under the compromise plan, less than 2/10 of 1 percent of estates would be subject to the estate tax next year, said Bob Williams of the Tax Policy Center. That means more than 99.8 percent would be completely exempt.The Tax Policy Center estimates that about 3,600 estates would be subject to the tax under the $5 million threshold. Those 3,600 estates would have to pay an estimated $11.4 billion in estate taxes under the compromise tax plan.Estate tax rates have fluctuated through modern history. In 2001, President George W. Bush signed a plan to gradually reduce the estate tax from 55 percent to 45 percent, while at the same time increasing the exemption value from $1 million in 2002 to $3.5 million in 2009. The estate tax disappeared altogether in 2010.But the Bush plan only had a 10-year window because Republicans didn't have the votes at the time to permanently abolish the estate tax. It passed the Senate under budget reconciliation, which requires only a simple majority of 51 votes but which also limited it to a 10-year shelf life. Barring a new tax agreement, the rate was set to revert next year to a 55 percent rate with an effective exemption of $1 million.Last year, Democrats proposed a plan to permanently set the estate tax rate at 2009 levels -- 45 percent on the value of estates over $3.5 million. But the plan never reached a vote in the Senate. Had that plan gone through, the Tax Policy Center estimates it would have subjected 6,460 estates to a tax (bring in an estimated $18.2 billion). If no tax plan passes, and the rate goes back to 55 percent on the value of estates over $1 million, an 43,540 estates would have to pay (bringing in an estimated $34.4 billion next year).Sanders was correct that in 2009, when the effective exemption was $3.5 million, about 99.7 percent of all estates were exempt and didn't pay anything. The compromise plan -- which would set effective exemption at $5 million -- would push the number of exempted estates even higher, so that more than 99.8 percent of estates would not pay anything.",1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,True

Final Rating: True  ",The average (Wisconsin) residents tax burden is at its lowest level in nearly 50 years while incomes continue to grow.,"Is Wisconsins tax burden at a 50-year low? That was the claim made by state Sen. Roger Roth, R-Appleton, when he gave the GOP response to Gov. Tony Evers 2020 State of the State speech. In the Jan. 22, 2020, speech, Roth touted Republican-backed investments in the states infrastructure, worker training and childhood education. The results, he said, are economic growth, low unemployment, higher wages and frozen college tuition without raising taxes. The average residents tax burden is at its lowest level in nearly 50 years, while incomes continue to grow, he said. Is he right? When asked for backup, Roths office pointed us to the Wisconsin Policy Forums January 2020 report, Tax Burden Falls Again. The report is an annual review of state and local taxes relative to state residents income. The Wisconsin Policy Forum is a nonpartisan research organization. The tax burden is the total share of taxes compared to income. The Wisconsin Policy Forum compiles all the state and local taxes in Wisconsin, using a variety of reports, such as the states Annual Fiscal Report, and information from state agencies. State and local tax revenue is compared relative to cumulative personal income of all income reported in Wisconsin. Those income numbers are from the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis. The forums report shows Wisconsin's tax burden for 2019 was the lowest since at least 1970, which is as far back as the organization has data. State and local taxes, combined, took up 10.3% of residents income in 2019, down slightly from 10.4% in 2018. The state has established a new tax burden low each year since 2015. Jason Stein, research director at the Wisconsin Policy Forum, noted that doesnt necessarily mean everyone is paying 10.3% of their income. Incomes and taxes vary region to region and person to person. Noah Williams, a professor of economics and director of the Center for Research on the Wisconsin Economy, echoed that point and said the policy forums approach is a reasonable one to use. The report shows overall tax burden has consistently trended down over the last 50 years, from an average of 14% in the 1970s to 11% across the 2010s. Behind the numbers The drop is not entirely the result of reduced tax collections. Indeed, according to the forum, state and local tax revenues increased by 4.5% in fiscal year 2019 — the most since 2011. So whats going on? Well, income has increased faster than average tax collections. Income has been on an upward trend since 2009. The policy forum found income grew by 5.1% in calendar year 2018, the most recent year available at the time of its report. Because income growth outpaced the increase in tax collection, the tax burden decreased. While taxes are determined by state and local governments, many other economic factors help drive income levels, Stein said. If the economys doing really well, its not purely a function of whats happening at the state level, Stein said. If it was doing really poorly, it wouldnt be purely a function of whats happening at the state level either. Roth claimed the average (Wisconsin) residents tax burden is at its lowest level in nearly 50 years, while incomes continue to grow. The numbers check out. While tax collections are up, incomes have been growing at a faster rate than taxes. Thus, the tax burden continues to edge down. ",1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,True

Final Rating: True",The Baucus bill contains provisions that would send massive federal subsidies directly to both private insurance plans and government-chartered cooperatives that pay for elective abortion.,"With the recent release of the Senate Finance Committee plan for health care reform, the abortion issue has re-emerged in the health care debate. And both sides are choosing their words carefully to score political points. We are examining two seemingly similar statements from the National Right to Life Committee that we think get to the heart of the rhetoric. One is that under the bill proposed by Senate Finance Committee Chairman Max Baucus, D-Mont., federal funds (tax dollars) would subsidize abortions; and the other is that federal subsidies would go to insurance companies that offer abortion coverage. They sound similar, but we ended up with rulings at opposite ends of our Truth-O-Meter. We take a look at the first claim, that federal tax dollars would subsidize abortions, in a separate item and conclude the statement isFalse. In this item, we deal with a statement from NLRC legislative director Douglas Johnson that the Baucus bill contains provisions that would send massive federal subsidies directly to both private insurance plans and government-chartered cooperatives that pay for elective abortion. If you look carefully, the issue here is government involvement in plans that offer abortion. And that's a big deal. The 1976 Hyde Amendment prohibits the use of federal funds for abortions through Medicaid except in cases of rape, incest or when the mother's health is in peril. So states that want to offer abortion coverage have to pay for it themselves. Similar restrictions on public funding for abortions applies to federal health care coverage extended to active and retired military and federal employees. Baucus said he attempted to find language that just maintains the status quo on abortion, because he didn't want the issue to be a distraction. This is a health care bill, not an abortion bill, Baucus said. Maintaining the status quo, however, is a matter of perception. And that's because there are two competing realities. On the one hand, as President Barack Obama acknowledged in a July 21 interview, We ... have a tradition of, in this town, historically, of not financing abortions as part of government-funded health care. In other words, the more than 250 private health plans that cover federal employees — because they are subsidized by the federal government — cannot offer full abortion services. On the other hand, many private plans (outside the government) currently offer abortion services. If the government starts providing health care subsidies but bans the participation of any plan that offers abortion services (as some legislators have suggested), abortion rights groups argue it would strip millions of women of benefits they currently get. According to a 2002 Guttmacher Institute study, 87 percent of employment-based insured health plans offered coverage for abortions (though not all companies select it for their employees). A 2003 Kaiser Family Foundation survey found that 46 percent of covered workers had coverage for abortions. The two surveys asked different questions, but the bottom line is that a significant percentage of women have health insurance that covers abortions. According to Baucus' chairman's mark, which provides a blueprint for the plan, abortion cannot be a mandated as part of any minimum benefits package except in cases of rape, incest or if the mother's life is in danger. However, health plans in the exchange or co-op would not be prohibited from providing abortion coverage. In fact, every state exchange would have to provide one plan that covers abortion and one that does not. The exchange is a virtual marketplace where people can comparison shop for an insurance plan. Baucus' alternative to a public option, a co-op, would be one alternative on the exchange (think of it as a credit union for health insurance). The plan provides federal dollars — through tax credits or cost-sharing credits — to subsidize the cost of insurance for people with modest incomes. So clearly, you'd have federal subsidies going to plans that cover abortions. But no more federal money would go to plans that offer abortion, so the added cost would presumably be passed on to consumers who choose plans that offer abortion, and efforts have been made to segregate funding so that only money from premiums — not tax dollars — would be used to pay for abortions. But if millions of uninsured people would now get insurance due to the health care plan, and some of the plans offer abortion coverage, we think it's fair to conclude the Baucus plan (or any other Democratic plan under consideration) would mean more women would have access to abortion services. That obviously doesn't sit well with National Right to Life and other antiabortion groups. Johnson said they'd like to see an amendment that would prohibit any insurer that gets federal subsidies from offering abortion services. Amendments to that effect failed in the House. The plan, as proposed, would lead to more abortion coverage, and therefore more abortions, Johnson said. The Hyde Amendment, he said, is one of the most important abortion reduction policies adopted by Congress. Not only can't the federal government subsidize abortion, he said, it cant subsidize plans that offer abortion. The Baucus bill, he said, is a big departure from where we are now. Here's Planned Parenthood's take on the Baucus plan: Planned Parenthood acknowledges that there are some compromises that need to be made to move health care reform forward, and we are willing to do so if it means more women can access affordable, quality health care from the provider of their choice. While we are concerned that the language in the Senate Finance Bill specifically singles out abortion, we understand it is necessary to move health care reform forward.As it currently stands, it is a carefully crafted compromise which assures that access to abortion would neither be mandated nor prohibited — and that women would not lose health care benefits that they have had for decades, while also addressing concerns that no federal funds would be used for abortion. In the abortion debate, nothing is simple. And as we said, words are chosen carefully. Regarding Johnson's claim that the Baucus plan would result in federal subsidies directly to both private insurance plans and government-chartered cooperatives that pay for elective abortion, we think he is on solid ground. One could argue whether or not this is a departure from making the bill abortion neutral — each side has its take on that — but the fact is the plan would allow insurers to offer abortion. And the plan includes federal subsidies to some who might choose to join such a plan. And so we rule Johnson's statement True.",1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,True

Final Rating: True  ","In 2011, more people were murdered with knives, hands or feet or clubs and hammers than with any type of rifle.","Gun-rights advocates have mounted an aggressive social-media campaign to blunt the popularity of the White Houses efforts to advance new restrictions on guns.One reader forwarded us a statistics-heavy Facebook post that echoes others weve received. It says, Facts gun control advocates dont want you to know. According to the FBI, in 2011, 1,694 were murdered with knives, 726 with hands or feet, 496 with clubs or hammers, 323 with rifles of any type. But Obama wants to ban semi-automatic rifles?We should first note that there is significant disagreement over what is, or should be, considered an assault weapon. For instance, even though the Facebook post references Obamas intention to ban semi-automatic rifles, California law already includes some types of handguns and shotguns in its definition of assault weapon.That said, well take a look at the number of deaths caused by rifles. To check the post, we looked at the 2011 edition of the FBIs annual Crime in the United States report. The report breaks down the types of weapons used in murder. These are the statistics for 2011, the most recent year available:  6,220 323 356 97 1,587 1,694 496 728 The Facebook post and the FBI stats are closely in tune. Except for a minor typo in the Facebook posts number for deaths by hands, fists or feet, the numbers are accurate.The number cited for rifles was somewhat less precise. While its true that the FBI counted 323 murders by rifles, the agency also counted 1,587 murders by an undetermined type of firearm and 97 by other guns. If gun usage in these two categories followed the same pattern as other gun homicides, that would add another 75 or so murders by rifle, making an estimate for the number of rifle murders about 400, rather than 323.Still, the larger point holds: Murders by knives, blunt objects and body parts each individually outweighed those committed using a rifle.We should note that while the Facebook posts comparison is accurate as far as it goes, it does ignore the single biggest category of weapons used in murders -- handguns. Handguns were used in 6,220 cases, or 72 percent of all firearm murders in 2011 and slightly under half of all murders using any kind of weapon that year.This caveat illustrates how the selection and framing of statistics can be used to bolster one side or the other in the gun debate.Our rulingThe post uses data selectively, ignoring the significant role of handguns in gun violence. But the statistics it mentions are solid. FBI data backs up the Facebook posts claim that in 2011, more people were murdered with knives, hands or feet or clubs and hammers than with any type of rifle.",1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,True

Final Rating: True",The House of Representatives does not have a prochoice majority.,"One of the more interesting twists in health care reform came on a recent vote in the House of Representatives on abortion coverage.An amendment restricting abortion coverage authored by Rep. Bart Stupak, a Democrat from Michigan, won the votes of all Republicans and 64 Democrats to become part of the health care reform bill passed by the House on Saturday. His measure further tightened rules about how insurers could offer abortion coverage, requiring them to offer separate policies in many instances. (Read ourdetailed explanation of the Stupak amendment here.)Abortion rights advocates should not have been surprised, said Rep. Loretta Sanchez, a Democrat from California, on the MSNBC showMorning Joe.Sanchez, who favors abortion rights, said that progressives are really angry because they believe poor women should have the choice to get an abortion if they want one.On the other hand, we have to acknowledge that the House of Representatives is not a majority prochoice, Sanchez said. And I've told that to a lot of pro-choice groups. I would count maybe about 150 prochoice votes. You need 218 to get to pass a bill.We wanted to know if Sanchez was correct that the House of Representatives is not majority prochoice.We first turned to an organization that favors abortion rights. NARAL Pro-Choice America rates members of Congress and has compiled its own profile of the current Congress. It labeled 185 members prochoice.Then we turned to the National Right to Life Committee, a group that opposes abortion. It doesn't rate the entire Congress in the same way, but the group has rated four abortion votes during the current Congress and created percentage ratings for each member. A 100 percent rating means a member fully agreed with the positions of National Right to Life; a 0 percent rating means they did not agree at all.We crunched the numbers, looking for members who never voted with the position of National Right to Life -- 185, the same as NARAL's prochoice members.Other numbers tend to support Sanchez's conclusion, but they also reveal the complexity of the issue and the fact that every member doesn't fall neatly into a yes-or-no category. NARAL labeled 203 members antichoice. National Right to Life gave only 179 members 100 percent ratings.NARAL labeled 47 members mixed choice, while National Right to Life found that 71 members voted with the group some of the time.So do those numbers add up to the conclusion that there isn't a prochoice majority in the House?NARAL spokesman Ted Miller agreed with Sanchez's comments. It is accurate to state that antichoice lawmakers outnumber our prochoice allies, Miller said in an e-mail interview. While the numbers are challenging, we have managed to win some key votes this session (family-planning vote and lifting D.C. abortion ban) by gaining support from some mixed- and even antichoice members.National Right to Life spokesman Douglas Johnson, on the other hand, downplayed the idea that antiabortion sentiment is growing in the House. His side does win some votes, he said, and the Stupak amendment was the clearest vote on abortion that we've had in the current Congress. But he doubts that Congress would overturn the U.S. Supreme Court decisionRoe vs. Wade, a major precedent establishing abortion rights.If you had a vote in the House on whether or not to overturnRoe vs. Wade, I believe that the majority would affirm that they would support it, Johnson said.In fact, a few members of Congress who voted for the Stupak amendment otherwise receive low ratings from National Right to Life. We counted 34 members who voted with the group on Stupak's amendment but against it on other issues.Indeed, the Stupak amendment represents a classic gray area: The measure does not forbid insurers from covering abortion, but it requires them to offer separate policies for people who pay for plans with their own money (as opposed to those who pay part of their premiums with government subsidies). Those who favor abortion rights say this will discourage insurers from offering coverage that includes abortion, and perhaps it will. But that's a business decision on the part of the insurers, not a government prohibition. We should add here that the Stupak amendment might not make it to the final bill, once the Senate considers its own version of health care reform.Getting back to Sanchez's statement: She said, the House of Representatives is not a majority prochoice. Her claim is supported by counts from both sides that show only 185 members are solidly in favor of abortion rights. It's worth noting that the number of antiabortion House members is less than a majority, too. But as for Sanchez's claim, she is right.",1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,True

Final Rating: True  ","Since 2008, U.S. crude oil output has increased by over 80 percent, an increase of over 4 million barrels a day. That is the fastest increase in U.S. history.","Republican presidential candidate Jeb Bush said in his recently released energy plan that the United States should take advantage of its resurgent status as a global energy superpower. Thanks to new means of extracting oil such as hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling, theres been an unprecedented spike in domestic oil production, the former Florida governor said. Since 2008, U.S. crude oil output has increased by over 80 percent, an increase of over 4 million barrels a day. That is the fastest increase in U.S. history, his plan read. Has oil production really seen the fastest increase in the nations history, topping 80 percent or higher since 2008? It sure has, reversing a decline that began back in 1986. We went to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, which keeps monthly and annual statistics for crude oil production. They said that in 2008, the United States produced 5 million barrels per day, a figure that has jumped to more than 9 million per day in 2015. A Bush spokeswoman confirmed to us that was the same data they were using when drawing up the energy plan. As you can see, thats a pretty steep spike in production over a seven-year period:  The change is largely because of the reasons Bush gave, according to EIA spokesman Jonathan Cogan. Better technology like fracking and horizontal drilling, which makes extraction from geological formations like layers of shale easier, has led to an overall increase in output. Relatively high oil prices (about $140 per barrel in 2008, as opposed to less than $50 recently) also helped lead to the ramp-up in production. You may recall that gas prices reached a single-day high in 2008, with a gallon costing $4.11 that July. The highest-ever nationwide annual average of $3.60 per gallon was in 2012. Mark Perry, a University of Michigan-Flint economics professor working with the conservative American Enterprise Institute, agreed that Bushs take is accurate. He said based on EIA numbers through July, U.S. crude production has gone up 83 percent since 2008. That bumps up to 88 percent if you measure the current 2015 average of almost 9.4 million barrels per day. (We will note that 2008 includes a storm-related drop in September, when hurricanes Ike and Gustav churned through the Gulf of Mexico and production dropped to less than 4 million barrels per day.) Its pretty clear that the production increase from 2008-15 ... has been the largest production increase ever in U.S. history in such a short period of time, he said via email. From 2009 to 2014, the increase in oil production didnt bring the price drop economists expected, Perry said. Now that oil prices have dropped so much recently, were just starting to see production back off. The latest EIA data showed production has dropped 144,000 barrels per day since July, with estimates saying its going to continue to decrease. It took a while for the price to finally catch up to the increased U.S. production, and now were in an adjustment period, Perry said. He said the slowdown was temporaryand will likely be followed by another period of increased production in a year or two when oil prices go back up above $50 and stay there. Our ruling Bush said, Since 2008, U.S. crude oil output has increased by over 80 percent, an increase of over 4 million barrels a day. That is the fastest increase in U.S. history. Thats accurate, as high prices and new extraction methods have led to a significant increase in the amount of crude oil the country produces. Depending on how you calculate it, production has gone up 83 percent through July, or 88 percent if you use the current 2015 average. Production is currently dipping downward, but its easily the fastest increase in a seven-year span in U.S. history.",1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,True

Scott Walkers ability to keep his No.1 campaign promise during the Democratic Party of Wisconsins annual convention. Pocan, D-Madison, attacked Walker and Republican lawmakers on job growth and other issues during his 15-minute speech, at one point focusing on the governors failed 2010 campaign promise to add 250,000 private-sector jobs within his first term. Seven years later, (Scott Walker) has not hit his first campaign promise of creating 250,000 jobs, Pocan said halfway through his June 2, 2017 speech.

(Scott Walker will) get government out of the way of employers ... who will then help Wisconsin create 250,000 jobs by 2015, and as we create those new jobs, we will be able to add 10,000 new businesses, his campaign said at the time. For the years 2011 through 2014, Wisconsin added 130,153 private-sector jobs, meaning Walker fell short of his first-term promise by about 100,000 jobs, according to the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages. For this tally, we used the Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages, which surveys nearly all state businesses, to get the most accurate picture for Walker's years in office. We made comparisons using the fourth quarter reports from the QCEW. The picture since Wisconsins economy has continued to add jobs throughout Walkers second term, but at a much slower pace. The fourth quarter numbers for 2015 and 2016 from the BLS show Wisconsin added 38,077 and 11,548 jobs respectively. The 2016 growth numbers were the worst during Walkers tenure and the worst since the economy rebounded after the 2008-09 recession. In total, Wisconsin has added a total of 179,778 private sector jobs during Walkers near seven years as governor, which puts him 70,000 short of the pledged 250,000 new jobs. Pocan spokesman David Kolovson said in an email that the congressmans claim was based on a March 12, 2017 Milwaukee Journal Sentinel story, which stated the governors promise remains elusive. The Journal Sentinel story listed the total number of jobs under Walker as 185,208, which differs from the total offered here because that article was published before the BLS released final numbers covering the end of 2016. Walker spokesman Tom Evenson also pointed to the same story and Wisconsin Department of Workforce Development numbers, saying in email we dont have anything to add. Wisconsins business climate has consistently improved from one of the worst in the nation to one of the best under Governor Walker, and our states economy is in the best shape its been in 16 years, Evenson said quoted as saying in the March story. Weve seen more people employed than ever before, wages are up, and Wisconsins labor force participation rate continues to be one of the best in the country. And yet, the topic of job creation under Walker lingers. President Donald Trump ran on the platform of being a jobs president, famously saying Ill be the greatest jobs president God ever created. In a June 13, 2017 visit to Wisconsin, President Donald Trump hinted at a major manufacturer locating to Wisconsin. The Journal Sentinel reported on June 15 that Foxconn, a Taiwanese company that assembles Apples iPhones and other electronics, is considering Wisconsin as the site for a 1,000-acre manufacturing plant, which could generate thousands of jobs. Our rating At the Democratic Party of Wisconsins state convention, Pocan said, Seven years later, (Scott Walker) has not hit his first campaign promise of creating 250,000 jobs. Pocan is right to say Walker hasnt hit his first campaign promise. The number of jobs created still falls short of that promise.",1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,True

Final Rating: True  ","Says a newannual report shows that West Virginias tourism industry has grown for the second consecutive year, reversing years of decline and outpacing national growth by 58 percent.","West Virginia Gov. Jim Justice took to Facebook in October to tout gains in his states tourism industry. When I took office, I made tourism a top priority because I knew it had all the potential in the world, Justice wrote in his post. Today I am proud to announce that West Virginias tourism industry has grown for the second consecutive year, reversing years of decline and outpacing national growth by 58%! Way to go West Virginia Tourism! The post linked to a press release that provided additional detail and cited a study conducted by Dean Runyan Associates, an economic consulting firm that has examined the states tourism industry annually since 2000. A year ago, we fact-checked how well Justice described the previous years statistics and rated it Mostly True, because Justice glossed over some of the reports negative findings. How about this year? Lets take a look, point by point. (Justices office did not respond to inquiries for this article.) This is accurate. The report found that overall spending on tourism in West Virginia grew from $4.14 billion in 2016 to $4.28 billion in 2017 to $4.55 billion in 2018. Thats an increase in the most recent year of 6.5%, easily exceeding the rate of inflation. Spending also grew for the second straight year if you set aside gambling revenue. It rose from $3.48 billion in 2016 to to $3.63 billion in 2017 to $3.91 billion in 2018. Thats an increase in the most recent year of 7.5%. This also exceeded the rate of inflation. This is accurate, too. According to the data in the report, the rise over the past two years came after four consecutive annual declines, as this chart shows:  The report also provides data for the national tourism market thats comparable to the West Virginia numbers. According to the report, spending was $980 billion in 2018, a 4.1% increase over 2017. (These figures are not adjusted for inflation, but neither is the West Virginia figure, so the national and state figures can be compared equitably.) Justices 58% figure appears to come from comparing the most recent one-year increase in West Virginia (6.5%) with the most recent one-year increase nationally (4.1%). The West Virginia percentage increase is 58.5% bigger than the national increase. Justice said, West Virginias tourism industry has grown for the second consecutive year, reversing years of decline and outpacing national growth by 58 percent. These numbers align with the findings of a longstanding annual study of the West Virginia and national tourism economies.",1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,True

Final Rating: True  ",A tax on soda and juice drinks would disproportionately increase taxes on low-income families in Philadelphia.,"Jim Kenneys proposed soda tax went national last week. Hillary Clinton led off what became a back-and-forth political battle by voicing her support for the tax at a forum in Philadelphia. Bernie Sanders chimed in later to call the tax regressive. Kenney fired back in an editorial on Huffington Post that his proposal, which would levy a three cent per ounce tax on distributors, was a corporate tax and said Sanders was siding with beverage corporations. Then Sanders responded with an editorial of his own, in Philly Mag. He basically gave an elongated version of what he said earlier in the week, which was, A tax on soda and juice drinks would disproportionately increase taxes on low-income families in Philadelphia. Is Sanders correct? Or was this political grandstanding?  Berkeley, Calif., remains the lone American city to enact a sugary drink tax. It taxes the distributors of sodas and similar beverages like sports drinks 1cent per ounce. Studies have shown some of the cost of tax has been passed on to consumers. A Cornell study found about 25 percent of it was passed on, and a University of California-Berkeley study found the amount to be between about 50 to 70 percent, depending on the type of beverage. The prices of soft drinks were more likely to go up at supermarkets than chain drug stores. Carl Davis, the research director at the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, told Billy Penn last month soda taxes like the one proposed by Philadelphia are imperfect: The first thing you realize is that it is regressive. Its going to hit lower and more moderate income families more heavily than higher-income families. William Shughart, a Utah State University professor and sin tax expert, explained taxes like the one proposed by Kenney disproportionately affect lower income residents because a greater amount of their income is used on food and drinks. Warren Gunnels, senior policy advisor for Sanders, said in an email, It would make much more sense to finance universal pre-school in Philadelphia by raising taxes on its wealthiest residents, who currently benefit from flat state and citytaxrates. Right now wealthy Philadelphianspaystate incometaxof 3.07 percent, an unemploymenttaxof 0.07 percent, and a city incometaxof 3.92 percent. Thats a total state and localtaxburden of 7.06 percent. By contrast, New York Citys wealthiest residents pay a top rate of 12.6 percent. Such a plan would be easier said than done, according to Kenneys administration. Because of the uniformity clause, its constitutionally impermissible right now in Pennsylvania to raise the income tax rate only for wealthy individuals, said Lauren Hitt, Kenneys communications director. The Republican controlled state legislature would have to change the constitution and were not holding our breath on that one. Our kids need Pre-K now. Kenney has said the tax is not regressive because he believes the money will stay in the neighborhoods. His finance director, Rob Dubow, said most consumers of sugary drinks are in poor neighborhoods. When Dubow suggested distributors would absorb some of the tax, City Council president Darrell Clarke responded, Fundamentally, I dont believe that.  Our ruling  Sanders said Kenneys proposed soda tax would disproportionately increase taxes for low income families. In the only other instance of a soda tax in the United States, studies have shown somewhere between 25 and 70 percent of the cost of the tax gets passed to consumers. Tax experts say if this tax reaches the consumer level it would affect low income residents to a greater extent.

Final Rating: True  ",Says the typical homeowner will pay $4 more per month if library district passes.,"When it comes to voting for or against increased taxes, its helpful to know exactly what the bottom line is. Just how much will this mean out of my pocket?Supporters of a new Multnomah County Library District -- the Libraries Yes! Committee -- tried to put the tax measure in some context in a recent mailer. The typical homeowner will pay $4 more per month than the amount we currently pay.We thought it was worth a quick check to see just what the measures impact would be for the average homeowner.We spoke with Liz Kaufman, who is handling media for the campaign, to see how it arrived at the $4 mark.She directed us to the measures explanatory statement written by Multnomah County Attorney Jenny Morf. In the statement, Morf wrote that If approved, the Multnomah County Library District will be formed with a permanent rate up to $1.24 per $1000 of assessed value. The typical homeowner will pay $49 a year above the cost of the current levy or $.89 per $1000 assessed value.So that extra 35 cents per $1,000 of assessed value would mean an extra $49 a year. Divide that by 12 and you get $4.08. The math checks out.Next we examined what constitutes a typical homeowner. According to Multnomah County, the median assessed home value for the county is $149,920. Homeowners at that level are paying just over $11 a month, or $133 a year, at the current 89-cent rate. That would get bumped up by about $4 to $15.50 -- or $185 annually -- if the tax district passes.We ran the numbers again, just to be safe, with the average assessed value, which is higher, about $178,000. At that number, homeowners currently pay $13.20 a month and can expect to pay $18.40 a month if the measure passes -- $5.20 more.By the way, homeowners wont see the full increase immediately. For the first five years, they would actually be charged $1.18 for each $1,000 of assessed value. After that, it starts to climb to the maximum $1.24.While the ultimate cost would be more for the average house, we think its fair to call the median number, where half the houses are assessed at more and half less, typical. Those figures back up the Libraries Yes! Committees claim that the typical homeowner will pay $4 more per month once the new district goes into full effect.",1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,True

Final Rating: True  ",The new 21st State Senate district was created in secret for Van Wanggaard. It was drawn within half a block of his house.,"Shortly after his June 5, 2012 recall election victory over incumbent Van Wanggaard was affirmed by a recount, state Sen. John Lehman (D-Racine) said it will be tough for him to win the seat again.Lehman told WTMJ radio listeners July 10, 2012, that the borders of 21st state Senate District were changed significantly by Republicans in 2011 when they controlled the Legislature. The redistricting is required every 10 years, based on updated census figures, and this was the first time in decades that one party in Wisconsin had complete control over the process.The seat is up in November 2014, and Wanggaard is expected to run.Im not surprised that hell run in the district, Lehman said. The district was created in secret for Van Wanggaard. It was drawn within a half a block of his house, around his house two blocks away then went out to western Racine and western Kenosha County down to the Illinois line.Sounds like neither Lehman nor Wanggaard should unpack their boxes.If Lehman and Wanggard face each other in 2014 (or earlier, if there is another recall), it would be the third time the two have run against each other. Wanggaard topped Lehman to win the seat in 2010. But the next time a much different mix of voters would make the choice.On July 13, 2011, the Journal Sentinels Craig Gilbert took a detailed look at the differences between the new and old 21st Senate district.The new plan goes to some extra lengths in reducing the potential for partisan competition, wrote Gilbert, author of the Wisconsin Voter blog. The most striking example is the transformation of two very competitive districts, the 21st in Racine County and 22nd in Kenosha County, into one very Republican Racine-Kenosha seat to the west and one very Democratic Racine-Kenosha seat to the east.Republicans who drew the lines have produced a plan that favors the GOP, which is certainly nothing new for political parties, the piece continued. Among the state's most competitive districts, the plan gives GOP incumbents Terry Moulton, Joe Liebham and Pam Galloway safer seats and (Alberta) Darling, (Leah) Vukmir and Wanggaard dramatically safer seats.In an earlier piece, Gilbert wrote:The Wanggaard seat would shed most of the city of Racine and some nearby areas -- wards that voted 63 percent Democratic in last fall's race for governor. (The one section of the city of Racine that's kept in the district is the one where Wanggaard lives.)Gilbert calculated that the new 21st was far more Republican, based on the vote in the 2010 governors race. Gov. Scott Walker would have won the district by 23 points, rather than 9 points in the old 21st.Now the maps borders.Wanggaard lives in the 1200 block of Blaine Ave. on the west side of Racine. The new border is 13th Ave., just south of his home. That portion of Racine -- Lehman calls it a peninsula -- lies within the new 21st district.(Indeed, Lehmans house is on Orchard St., several blocks away from Wanggaard. His house, too, lies just inside the new district.)On the in secret question, GOP lawmakers were allowed to see advance copies of their proposed district maps at the law offices of Michael Best & Friedrich near the Capitol. The Republican lawmakers -- including Wanggaard -- signed confidentiality agreements in which they promised not to disclose the contents of the maps, according to a Feb. 6, 2012, Journal Sentinel article.Our ratingLehman says the new 21st State Senate district was created in secret for Van Wanggaard. It was drawn within half a block of his house.Its common, of course, for the party in control to draw maps favorable for itself -- and the lines in question here have been approved by the courts. While the points Lehman cites may sound outrageous, even unbelievable, the record shows them to be accurate.",1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,True

Final Rating: True  ","In the past three years, we have prosecuted or brought more cases on access to public records than in the previous 12 years combined.","Rhode Island has long been a battleground in the fight for open government. Public bodies vote in secret. Deals are cut behind closed doors. Police departments withhold arrest records and daily logs. A report issued last month by ACCESS/RI found a troubling level of non-compliance with the state's open records law and called for enhanced oversight by the Attorney General's office. During an interview with Rhode Island Public Radio that aired on Oct. 2, 2014, incumbent Atty. Gen. Peter Kilmartin, a Democrat, was asked about enforcement of the open records law. He lamented that some public bodies are not following the law despite repeated attempts to educate government officials about the documents that are supposed to be public. Unfortunately, in the past three years, we have prosecuted or brought more cases on access to public records than in the previous 12 years combined, he said. That tells me there is still a problem. It's a statement he repeated on Oct. 10, 2014, during a taping of a debate on WPRI-TV with Republic Dawson Hodgson. We were interested in whether Kilmartin has brought more open records cases to court than his two predecessors, Patrick Lynch (now a lawyer in private practice) and Sheldon Whitehouse (now a U.S. Senator). When we asked Kilmartin's office for a tally of the cases, spokeswoman Amy Kempe sent us a list of 18 civil lawsuits dating as far back as 2002. There were no lawsuits from 1999 to 2002, she said in an email. According to the list, Whitehouse took one case to court, suing the Anthony fire district in 2002. During Lynch's eight years in office he filed seven suits -- against public entities in Johnston, North Kingstown, Cranston, Woonsocket and Lincoln. Barrington was sued twice. Since 2011, according to the list, Kilmartin has filed 10 suits against public entities for violating the open records law, starting with the Albion Fire District in Lincoln (which Lynch also sued) and ending most recently with the town of Warren. We spot-checked Kilmartin's cases using our archives. To check the list of his predecessors, we first contacted the offices of Lynch and Whitehouse to ask if Kilmartin was omitting any cases. Whitehouse's office said the number seems correct. Repeated inquiries to Lynch's law office produced no response. So we turned to court records and received a list of all civil suits brought by Whitehouse and Lynch against public bodies. Once again, Kilmartin's tally checked out. In summary, Peter Kilmartin said that in the past three years, his office has prosecuted or brought more cases on access to public records than in the previous 12 years combined. His office has filed 10 suits since 2011. Lynch had seven during his eight years as Attorney General. Whitehouse had just one during his four years in that office. We can't say if the trend is due to previous attorneys general being less aggressive in prosecuting violations of the state's open government laws than Kilmartin, or if public bodies are getting more brazen in ignoring them. Certainly the latest ACCESS/RI report offers evidence that the phrase open government is -- for some of Rhode Island's public bodies -- an oxymoron.

Final Rating: True  ","As CEO of WWE, Linda McMahon was caught tipping off a ringside physician about a federal investigation into illegally distributing steroids to wrestlers.","U.S. Senate candidate Linda McMahon's experience as co-founder, along with her husband Vince, of World Wrestling Entertainment has proved to be a double-edged sword on the campaign trail in Connecticut.While McMahon often touts her experience running the pro wrestling empire to boost her real-world business cred, it also has left her open to accusations that the WWE uses sexist story lines and that there is rampant steroid abuse by some wrestlers.In the final week of the race -- which pits Republican McMahon against Democrat Richard Blumenthal -- the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee has begun airing an attack ad that attempts to body-slam McMahon for tipping off a ringside physician about a federal investigation into the illegal distribution of steroids to some of the WWE's wrestlers.Read this, a female narrator begins, as a legal document scrolls in the background. It's a memo Linda McMahon wrote. Evidence in a federal trial against her company. McMahon was caught tipping off a ringside physician who was later accused of hiding evidence. It didn't work. McMahon's ringside doctor was convicted of illegally distributing steroids to her workers. That's Linda McMahon. A bad CEO. A worse senator.The memo in question -- marked CONFIDENTIAL INTEROFFICE MEMO -- was sent on Dec. 1, 1989, by Linda McMahon to Pat Patterson, a fellow executive at Titan Sports, the parent company of what was then the World Wrestling Federation. It became part of the public record as an exhibit in a steroids-related case against Vince McMahon and Titan Sports in the early 1990s.But the story actually goes back a little further, to an investigation into ringside doctor George T. Zahorian for distributing steroids to some of the WWF's wrestlers.As the 1989 memo from Linda McMahon explains, a government official let slip at a fundraising event that the State of Pennsylvania is probably going to launch an investigation into the use of all illegal drugs including steroids.In addition, McMahon wrote, this fellow mentioned that he was aware of Dr. Zahorian and his relationship with WWF.Zahorian was actually assigned throughout the 1980s to attend WWF exhibitions in Pennsylvania by the Pennsylvania Athletic Commission. But following deregulation in 1989, promoters like the WWF were required to hire their own licensed physicians to be present at events. Zahorian was scheduled to be the doctor on hand at an upcoming event in Hershey, Pa., but Linda McMahon's memo makes clear the WWF wanted to distance itself from him.Although you and I discussed before about continuing to have Zahorian at our events as the doctor on call, I think that is now not a good idea, McMahon wrote in the memo. Vince agreed, and would like for you to call Zahorian and tell him not to come to any more of our events and to also clue him in on any action that the Justice Department is thinking of taking.It's that last part, telling Patterson to clue him in about a possible steroids investigation, that forms the basis for the claim in the campaign ad.In 1991, Zahorian was charged with distributing steroids to a number of WWF wrestlers (none of whom were charged because, at the time, it was not a federal crime to use steroids, only to distribute them). He was convicted and sentenced to three years in federal prison.But that wasn't the end of the matter. In the wake of the Zahorian indictment, federal investigators opened a wide-reaching steroids investigation into the WWF. And in 1992, the government filed an indictment against Vince McMahon and Titan Sports, alleging they conspired to unlawfully provide WWF wrestling performers with steroids to enhance their size and musculature, and thereby to increase the ticket sales for WWF exhibitions and the profits to Titan and McMahon.In its indictment, prosecutors alleged Titan officials learned of a federal investigation into Zahorian's activities and warned him about it. Linda McMahon's memo was entered in the case as Exhibit #2.According to the indictment, shortly after the memo was sent, a Titan executive known to the Grand Jury had a telephone conversation with Zahorian and directed him to destroy any records of Zahorian's contact with WWF or WWF wrestling personnel. It was later learned from one of Zahorian's attorneys that after Zahorian got the phone call warning him about the investigation, he shipped files on wrestlers to his attorney's office (so they were not part of the evidence seized when investigators raided his office). But according to longtime WWE attorney Jerry McDevitt, the files were never destroyed and were later made available to prosecutors.Dr. Zahorian didn't destroy anything, McDevitt said. It was all given to the government.In any event, the government's case against Titan and Vince McMahon failed miserably. Several counts were tossed before the case even went to the jury -- including two counts alleging that Vince McMahon and the company distributed steroids to wrestlers such as Terry Bollea (aka Hulk Hogan), because the judge said prosecutors failed to establish that the alleged conspiracy occurred in the jurisdiction of the New York court where the case was filed.And on the one remaining count, that they had distributed mislabeled anabolic steroids, both Vince McMahon and the company were acquitted. In other words, none of the charges ever stuck.In an extensive story about the issue in Connecticut's The Day, reporter Ted Mann asked McMahon about the memo.I don't pretend to remember to go back, to revisit all the aspects of that case, McMahon told The Day. It has been tried, acquitted and done with, and WWE has evolved its total health and wellness policy over the years, and I'm sure will continue to evolve.According to the story:When asked if her decision to notify Zahorian had led him to destroy records that might have more thoroughly documented his sale of steroids to WWF wrestlers — as prosecutors in 1994 alleged — McMahon's reply was curt.I can't speak to any of that,' she said. I have no idea.WWE attorney Jerry McDevitt said he believes the DSCC ad is misleading, because it suggests by innuendo that Linda McMahon sought to obstruct the government's investigation.There were never any charges against Linda McMahon of any kind, McDevitt said. There was never any charge of obstruction of justice against anybody.An indictment is nothing more than an allegation, McDevitt said, and the case ended without a conviction against anyone on anything.You can only gain an acquittal in this country, McDevitt said. That's all you can do.Everyone agrees Linda McMahon was never charged with or convicted of anything, including obstruction of justice. But the ad from the DSCC doesn't say she was. The ad accuses McMahon of tipping off a ringside physician about a federal investigation into distributing steroids to their wrestlers. How else could one interpret Linda McMahon's direction in the 1989 memo to also clue him (Zahorian) in on any action that the Justice Department is thinking of taking.It's also true that a government indictment later alleged that, after getting a call from a Titan employee tipping him off to the investigation, Zahorian tried to hide evidence at his attorney's office. But whether Zahhorian tried to hide evidence may or may not be true. Zahorian sent files to his attorney, but they were not destroyed, and according to WWE's attorney, they were later made available to investigators. Nothing in Linda McMahon's memo suggests she directed the employee to tell Zahorian to hide or destroy evidence. But again, the ad doesn't say she did. The ad merely says she tipped off the ringside physician about an investigation. She did, according to her own memo. And Zahorian was later convicted of distributing steroids to some of her WWF wrestlers.",1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,True

Final Rating: Mostly False  ",Says Scott Walker enacted the biggest cuts to education in our states history.,"Democrats searching for the right combination of punches to drive Scott Walker from office have focused on joblessness, schools, tax fairness and leadership style.One of the jabs they throw repeatedly centers on cuts Walkers 2011-13 budget made in state aid to local school districts.Kathleen Falk, the best-known Democrat so far in the likely 2012 gubernatorial recall election, tried to land a roundhouse right as she became the first announced candidate.The former Dane County executive told a Feb. 8, 2012 audience in La Crosse that Walker has divided us instead of united us.He's done it with the wrong choices, Falk said, according to a WXOW-TV online story. He gave big tax breaks for a few and then made the biggest cuts to education in our state's history.The states history covers a long time.Are Walkers cuts truly the largest ever?We have already looked at several statements about Walkers education budget.We gave state Rep. Jennifer Shilling, D-La Crosse, a Mostly False for saying Walkers property tax freeze would cost schools $1.6 billion in revenue. It was about half that, according to the most common accounting.We labeled Mostly False a claim from Senate Minority Leader Mark Miller that Wisconsin enacted the most drastic cuts to K-12 public schools of any state in the nation. At the time, the study he cited looked at only 24 states, not all 50.Now we have Falks claim.It is bold, but it actually is narrowly drawn, referring specifically to cuts in state aid -- a number easy to track and measure.Asked for backup, Falks campaign said she was referring not just to state aid to local schools, but cuts in state funding to the university system and technical colleges. And she meant the biggest cut ever in raw dollars, according to campaign spokesman Scot Ross.To be sure, Walker made two other moves that affected school budgets: A virtual freeze on schools ability to increase property taxes to make up for lost aid, and collective bargaining limits that allowed many districts to cut costs by imposing larger contributions from workers towards health insurance and pensions.But Falks statement was not about net impact, just the state funding side of the equation.Falks campaign did not provide a total of the education cuts, nor provide any history of funding cuts other than to say they had found none bigger.We did the math and found $792 million in aid cuts to school districts, $250 million in reduced aid to the university system and $71.6 million from the tech colleges.Total: $1.11 billion.Looking at it in terms of raw dollars limits the usefulness of any comparison, given inflation. That said, lets look back.Local schoolsWalkers budget was not the first to cut education aid, though any cut is rare.Facing a massive projected shortfall, lawmakers and then-Gov. Jim Doyle, a Democrat, approved cutting $284 million from aid to school districts in the 2009-11 budget.The cut under Doyle was the first ever, according to Todd Berry, president of the Wisconsin Taxpayers Alliance, a nonpartisan research group that tracks the history of aid changes.We couldnt confirm that, but went back to the mid 1980s and found no evidence of a cut. If there was one earlier than that, it couldnt rival Walkers -- unless a previous governor cut 100 percent of the school aid budget, which was much smaller then.Walkers $792 million cut was much larger in raw dollars than the $284 million cut in 2009, and as a percentage -- 7.4 percent vs. 2.6 percent.In the first year under Walkers budget, nearly all districts lost aid, and the median decrease was 9.9 percent, according to the state Department of Public Instruction.University systemDoyle and Walker cut identical amounts -- $250 million -- from the base budget of the UW system. The cut under Doyle was in 2003-05.The cut under Doyle was a bigger percentage cut than Walkers because the university systems biennial budget from state taxes grew from about $2 billion to $2.3 billion between 2003 to 2011.On the other hand, Walkers cut was deeper if you factor all the budget adjustments to the state-tax-supported portion of UWs budget, according to Dave Loppnow, an education funding expert at the nonpartisan Legislative Fiscal Bureau.For instance, UW got more state funding for things like rising fuel and utility costs, offsetting some of the $250 million funding cut. By this measure, it was about an 8 percent reduction by Doyle, and 9 percent under Walker.Loppnow said the $250 million base-budget cuts under both governors were the largest ever in raw dollars.Tech schoolsWalker proposed, and the Republican-controlled Legislature passed, a 30 percent cut in general aid to the states technical college system. That amounted to $71.6 million over two years.The tech college system found records dating to 1991 that showed only one other general aid cut -- a 0.5 percent trim in 2007.As we noted in a recent item, that general aid is only 12 percent of the tech systems funding, which relies heavily on property taxes.So, in the big picture, there have been very few instances of cuts to education, with all of them coming in recent years as deficits mounted.What makes the Walker cuts stand out is the combination -- in the same budget -- of reductions across the three levels of education: kindergarten-12th grade; tech colleges; and the universities.In 2003-05, when the UW took a hit, Doyle and lawmakers boosted the K-12 budget by 1 percent, or $115 million. And the tech colleges general state aid was not reduced.As we noted, there were many other changes in the budget.Notably, Walker sharply curtailed collective bargaining rights for public employees, including university and local school employees.That allowed local school districts to save at least $200 million in pension costs because most districts put in place a pension change made possible by the budget, according to Legislative Fiscal Bureau estimates, school officials and our calculations.The savings to districts from changes to health insurance premiums were significant in some cases, but vary widely by district; no statewide cost savings estimate is available.But some districts, due to existing union contracts and other reasons, were not able to benefit from the health insurance changes. That underlines an element essential aspect of Falks statement: The state controls its aid, but not what is done at the local level.Our conclusionFalk claimed Walkers cuts in state support to local schools, tech colleges and public universities amount to the largest in state history.We found previous cuts in those areas, but not in all three in the same year, and not nearly as deep when you roll them all together as has Falk.",0.7,0.4,1.0,0.6,0.0,0.3,0.5,1.0,0.5,Mostly False

Final Rating: True  ","For the first time in 35 years, we have more businesses dying than we do starting.","At the economic summit for Republican presidential candidates convened by Florida Gov. Rick Scott, Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., expressed concern about entrepreneurialism in the United States. For the first time in 35 years, we have more businesses dying than we do starting, Rubio said at the June 2, 2015, event. Is that correct? We took a closer look. We located a May 2014 report by the Brookings Institution, a Washington-based think tank, titled, Declining Business Dynamism in the United States: A Look at States and Metros. In that report, coauthors Robert Litan and Ian Hathaway published data that supports Rubios claim. Their calculations come from a collection of U.S. Census Bureau data called Business Dynamics Statistics. Recent evidence points to a U.S. economy that has steadily become less dynamic over time, they wrote. They found that the rate of business failures held steady, except for an uptick during the Great Recession -- but they also found that the entry rate of new firms declined by nearly half between 1978 and 2011. The precipitous drop since 2006 is both noteworthy and disturbing, the authors wrote. Heres the kicker from the report: Business deaths now exceed business births for the first time in the 30-plus-year history of our data, the authors wrote. Heres a graph showing the trend line: Technically, the crossover point occurred in 2008, so its not as if this happened in the past year or two. Still, we checked with Litan to make sure Rubio wasnt twisting the statistic in any way, and Litan responded that Rubios claim is accurate. Its true, Litan told PolitiFact, adding, We havent reversed this yet. As for the causes, the authors of the Brookings report acknowledged being uncertain themselves. However, the report added, it is clear that these trends fit into a larger narrative of business consolidation occurring in the U.S. economy --whatever the reason, older and larger businesses are doing better relative to younger and smaller ones. Our ruling Rubio said that for the first time in 35 years, we have more businesses dying than we do starting. The change didnt happen in the past year or two -- it occurred in 2008 -- but in general, Rubio has accurately cited a statistic from a respected think tanks report. The co-author of that report said he feels Rubio has stated the claim accurately.",1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,True

Final Rating: True  ",Theyve seen employer-supported coverage increase in Massachusetts after this law (Romneycare) was implemented.,"One of the defining public policy debates of our time has been about Obamacare, formally the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, passed in 2010. So PolitiFact Rhode Island was listening closely to the July 28, 2013 broadcast of Channel 12 Newsmakers, on which Rhode Island Lt. Gov. Elizabeth H. Roberts appeared. She is a leading figure in the debate, as chairwoman of the state Healthcare Reform Commission, which is charged with implementing Obamacare in Rhode Island. Providence Journal reporter Felice Freyer, one of the panelists, asked Roberts a hot-button question about Obamacare, which calls for the creation of state health insurance exchanges where individuals who dont have health insurance or are seeking an alternative to plans provided by their employers may buy their own coverage. Since World War II, employer-paid coverage has been a cornerstone of health care insurance in the United States. Any possibility that the cornerstone will crumble has been a major topic in the debate. The Obamacare exchange is scheduled to open for enrollees in Rhode Island Oct. 1. After that happens, Freyer wanted to know, might employers just cancel their own insurance -- in order to save money and trouble -- and fob off their employees on the exchange. In reply, Roberts pointed to Romneycare. That is the seven-year-old health care insurance program in Massachusetts nicknamed for former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney and often cited as the model for Obamacare. Theyve seen employer-supported coverage increase in Massachusetts after [Romneycare] was implemented, Roberts declared. I think lots of people were worried [that employers might drop coverage] but it hasnt been what has happened. Are more Massachusetts employers providing coverage now than before Romneycare? First, a little background. Obamacare requires businesses with 50 or more employees to offer health insurance or pay a penalty. In Massachusetts, a penalty that applied to businesses with 11 or more employees was in force until July 1, when it was abolished in anticipation of the implementation of the Obamacare penalty. But then implementation of the federal employer mandate and accompanying penalty unexpectedly were delayed until 2015. Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick has warned employers in his state not to take advantage of the hiatus by dropping their insurance. A trip to the website of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts Health Insurance Connector Authority, the agency that oversees Romneycare, showed that Roberts had her facts right. In 2001, well before Romneycare took effect, 69 percent of Massachusetts employers offered insurance, according to the Connector. As of 2010, four years after Romneycare was enacted, 77 percent offered insurance, the Connector says. Fresher data from another government body, the Center for Health Information and Analysis of the Massachusetts Executive Office of Health and Human Services, confirmed the trend. From 2005, the year before Romneycare was signed into law, through 2011, the percentage of employers offering insurance increased from 70 percent to 76 percent, according to a survey of employers. And a study by the independent Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation, Massachusetts Health Care Reform: Six Years Later, found that employer coverage had not decreased. When we checked with Roberts office about the basis of her statement, her spokeswoman, Maria Tocco, referred us to the Health and Human Services survey, albeit from a companion report. Nationally, according to Massachusetts authorities, only 60 percent of employers offer health insurance. Asked why more Massachusetts employers offered insurance even though an alternative had been created, Jason Lefferts, the Connector director of communications, said the business community responded to a call to duty from government when health care reform was enacted. We saw great buy-in from the business community and an acceptance that health care is a shared responsibility of the individual, business and government, Lefferts said. There was a message that everyone was in this together. The Massachusetts authorities went even further on the Connector website, to predict that as employment rebounds in their state, reliance on public sector insurance will decrease. Lefferts said the business communitys track record makes that a safe prediction. Our ruling Rhode Island Lt. Gov. Elizabeth H. Roberts said that Massachusetts has seen employer-supported coverage increase since Romneycare was implemented. Massachusetts officials have published figures that back her up. The judges rate her claim True.   ",1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,True

Final Rating: True  ","We are almost halfway to our goal of 1,000 rapes prosecuted!","Ohios March 15 primary will essentially decide the Cuyahoga county prosecutor's race. No Republican candidate is running. Incumbent Tim McGinty and his challenger, Michael C. OMalley, are both Democrats. McGintys website, McGintyForProsecutor.com, is peppered with exclamation points touting his successes since coming into office in 2012. We decided to check out some of the claims McGinty makes about his last four years. I formed one of the nation's most successful Rape Kit Task Force to eliminate the backlog of 4,850 rape kits that were untested for decades, McGinty says. Our Rape Kit Task Force will solve and prosecute 1,000 forgotten rape cases. Hundreds of serial rapists will finally be indicted. We are almost halfway to our goal of 1,000 rapes prosecuted! In 2009, Cleveland police began sending forensic evidence to the Ohio Bureau of Investigation's laboratory in response to news reports that sounded the alarm about thousands of sexual assault kits that never underwent DNA testing. When those DNA profiles match known offenders from a national database, prosecutors can file charges. But what does McGinty mean by almost halfway to our goal of 1,000, in terms of rapes prosecuted?  We asked the Cuyahoga Prosecutors Office for the numbers, and heres what they turned up, as of Feb. 9, 2016:  1,424 completed investigations 2,193 active investigations 444 indicted defendants 136 convictions (out of 149 completed cases) 91.3 percent conviction rate If the goal was to have 1,000 rapes prosecuted, 444 comes pretty close to almost halfway. But is indicted the same as prosecuted?    Yes, says Jonathan Witmer-Rich, an associate law professor at Cleveland State University. A prosecution begins when charges are filed, usually by the prosecutor, Witmer-Rich told PolitiFact Ohio. That is the beginning of the case. So it would be correct to say that McGinty is prosecuting a particular defendant even though they have not gone to trial yet or been convicted. Once charges are filed, the defendant is being prosecuted.  But can McGinty claim responsibility for the initiative to test the countys rape-kit backlog? Various media sources credit Ohio Attorney General Mike DeWine for putting out the call, over four years ago, for police departments to clear their evidence rooms of shelved rape kits and send them to the central state lab for DNA testing. This month, DeWines office marked the 10,000th sexual assault kit tested.  Jill Del Greco, the public information officer for the Ohio Attorney General, says that McGinty deserves credit. A lot more goes into it -- when we get a hit, they cant necessarily go out and make an arrest, Del Greco says. Once we obtain the DNA testing results, we return the results to the investigating agency. Witnesses have to be tracked down, she continued, and oftentimes, the victim has to be found again, too, when years have passed since the crime occurred. Its up to the prosecutors and police departments in each jurisdiction to re-boot these investigations. Our rating McGinty said his office is almost halfway to his goal of prosecuting 1,000 rapes as a result of testing a cache of thousands of previously untested rape kits. As of Feb. 9, 444 defendants had been indicted, which is nearing the halfway point of 500.",1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,True

Final Rating: True",While I was mayor of the city of Providence we had the lowest crime rate in 30 years.,"With U.S. Rep. David Cicilline coming under fire for his work as a defense attorney, the Democrat has been fighting back by saying that, during his tenure as mayor of Providence, the city logged the lowest crime rate in three decades.I'm very proud that while I was mayor of the city of Providence we had the lowest crime rate in 30 years, Cicilline said during his Oct. 16 debate against Republican Brendan Doherty, the former superintendent of the Rhode Island State Police.Cicilline talked about the crime statistics at least three times during the WPRI - Providence Journal faceoff.At the time PolitiFact Rhode Island first looked at the issue -- in 2010 when Cicilline first ran for Congress -- data were only available through 2009.Since then, PolitiFact national and its affiliates have begun looking at such statements with a focus on whether the implied cause and effect is fair and accurate. With that perspective, we decided to reexamine Cicillines claim and to include the statistics for 2010, Cicilline's last year as mayor.To recap, in 2010 we looked at data collected by the Providence Police Department on various crimes going back to 1960 and focused on the sum of all reports of murder, rape, robbery, aggravated assault, burglary, larceny and motor vehicle theft, which the police call the crime index.For 2009, the last year available at the time, there were 9,252 such crimes reported in Providence, according to police. That was the lowest number since 1965, 44 years earlier.Last week, we asked the Police Department for more recent figures.Meanwhile, we got Providence data from the FBI website. So we'll use that for now.There's one big caveat to this. The FBI and the city classify crimes a bit differently. As a result, in recent years Providence has invariably reported more crime incidents than the FBI lists on its website, even though Providence is the source of both numbers. In other words, the FBI numbers make Providence look better than the city's own numbers do. However, the trends are similar.The FBI numbers say the Providence crime index in 2009 was 9,173, or 79 fewer than the city reported.Going forward to 2010, the FBI says the number rose to 9,472, an increase of 299 incidents or 3.3 percent.However, Cicilline talked about crime rate, which is the number of reported crimes for the population. Because Providence's population went up in 2010, the crime rate in 2010 was 53.2 incidents per 1,000 people, which is lower than the year before and the lowest of any year during the Cicilline administration.(We've put the FBI statistics on a spreadsheet that can be downloaded from www.scribd.com/politifactri.) When we received Providence police's updated data, we found that the statistics for the Cicilline administration had shifted, which can happen from year to year because categories can shift, such as when an assault becomes a murder.(In two of the years, the shifts were dramatic. The new numbers were 7.7 percent lower for 2005 and 4.2 percent lower for 2007. We asked for an explanation for the discrepancies, but havent received a response from the department.)But even with those numbers, the trend remains the same, with the crime index reaching a nadir in 2009 and the number of crimes rising a bit in 2010.Looking at the broader picture, Cicilline's comments at the Oct. 16 debate suggest that he and his administration were responsible for the decline, and it was clear from when we first did the story that officials think initiatives such as community policing played a role.However, the drop in overall Providence crime came at a time that crime was dropping nationally for a variety of reasons, including the aging of the population. Thus, the evidence is muddled.One thing that argues in Cicilline's favor is the fact that the decline in the Providence crime rate was steeper than the national decline during the early years of his administration. However, that decline seemed to have leveled off during his final three years in office.Our RulingDavid Cicilline said that, While I was mayor of the city of Providence we had the lowest crime rate in 30 years.That's actually an understatement. The 2009 rate was the lowest in Providence in four decades. The rate went down just a bit more in 2010 because a population increase in Providence washed out an increase in the actual number of reported crimes.The downward trend in Providence coincides with a national decline in the rate of serious crimes, but the decline in the early years of his administration was steeper than the national average.Cicilline and the Providence Police Department may have played a significant role in bringing the numbers down as well, but the scope of that effect is impossible to quantify with any certainty.Nonetheless, the evidence is strong enough for the judges to rate Cicilline's statement True.(Get updates from PolitiFact Rhode Island on Twitter: @politifactri.

Final Rating: True  ",We spend more per student than almost any other major country in the world.,"While Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump was campaigning recently in Cleveland -- not for the first time, and surely not the last down the elections home stretch -- he made a stop at a charter school. Public schools, he said, are wasting taxpayers money. Lets run through the numbers. At the state and federal level, the United States spends more than $620 billion dollars on K-12 education each year, Trump said on Sept. 8, 2016. Thats an average of about $12,296 dollars for every student enrolled in our elementary and secondary public schools. The federal government pays for about 10 percent of the K-12 costs. The other roughly $560 billion dollars spent on K -12 education comes from the states themselves. We spend more per student than almost any other major country in the world. And were doing very poorly in terms of A-list. Back in January, Trump made a similar statement about U.S. education spending, saying we were No. 1 per-pupil by a factor of four. PolitiFact rated the statement Mostly False because it is exaggerated. This new claim is a bit more tempered. Does the United States spend more per student than other major countries? The question is, how do you define major?said Neal McCluskey, director of the libertarian Cato Institutes Center for Educational Freedom. He is a proponent of cutting federal involvement in K-12 education. McCluskey relies on data from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, a consortium of 34 member countries that share internationally comparable statistical, economic and social data. Their education statistics from 2012 were the most up-to-date available at the time of Trumps statement. According to the OECD, Switzerland spends the most per student at $15,500 per student, followed by Norway, and then the United States. Switzerland ranks first on the Global Competitiveness Index, which ranks economic strength. Norway is a not-too-shabby 11th place. The United States is third.  The United States per-student expenditure at the elementary/secondary level was 31 percent higher than the OECDs average of $9,000. It certainly is the case that we spend more than almost any country except Norway and Switzerland, McCluskey said. Very few countries outspend us in terms of absolute numbers. The United Kingdom, Japan, Germany, they all spend less than we do. I suppose you could say theyre all major. Trumps financial figures -- $620 billion on K-12 education nationally, $12,296 per student, on average -- match the totals reported by the National Center on Education Statistics. A conclusion from the 2012 Program for International Student Assessment, a test administered to 15-year-old students in 65 countries, called out the United States for high spending and underperforming. While the U.S. spends more per student than most countries, this does not translate into better performance, it read. American students scores on the test weremediocre. In math, American 15-year-olds ranked No. 26 out of the 34 participating countries. That concurs with Trumps assessment that were doing very poorly, education-wise. For a country that spends as much as we do, youd think wed have better outcomes, McCluskey said. Our ruling Trump said that in the United States spends more per student than almost any other major country in the world. Trumps assertion that U.S. taxpayers dont get enough bang for their relative buck, when our students test scores are ranked worldwide, checks out. The most recent numbers put the United States at third for government spending on education, behind Switzerland and Norway.",1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,True

Final Rating: True  ",Rhode Island spends 52 percent more per capita on human service programs than the national average.,"If you're strapped for cash, as Rhode Island certainly is, you're always looking for a way to cut expenses.One area often targeted by pundits, because it makes up such a large share of the state budget, is spending on human services such as Medicaid, which provides health care to low-income people.In April, we looked at one aspect of that portion of the budget, giving a Half True to a statement by Rhode Island Tea Party founder Colleen Conley that Rhode Island has the most generous welfare benefits in New England. (We found that every New England state, except Maine, pays more to its welfare recipients.)During the June 26 broadcast of 10 News Conference, Gary Sasse, former director of the Rhode Island Department of Administration and the business-backed Rhode Island Public Expenditure Council, made a related comparison, saying that the state gives out far more benefits than the national average.Speaking of what is now the 2012 state budget, Sasse said that of the $200-million increase [in overall spending], 90 percent is to support human service programs. We spend 52 percent more per capita on human service programs than the national average.When reporter Bill Rappleye asked for specific numbers, Sasse said, Well, we spend about $9,300 per capita on Medicaid programs, and that's soup to nuts, that's everything from RIte Care to nursing homes. The average for the country is about $6,100. There's a $3,000 difference.So the question on human services is not necessarily cutting back on eligibility, but looking at what optional services we provide. We provide about $60 [million] -- probably more than that, probably about $70 million -- in optional Medicaid services that many other states don't provide.We asked Sasse for the source of his assertion that Rhode Island spends $1.52 for every $1 spent nationally.He gave us two.The first is a Feb. 10 presentation developed by the House Finance Committee, which reported that in 2008, a total of $294 billion was spent nationally on Medicaid recipients. That averages out to $6,120 per recipient (19.4 percent of the money went to children, 13.5 percent went to adults, 43 percent was for the disabled and 24.1 percent was spent on the aged).In Rhode Island that year, the state spent $1.7 billion (about 52 percent of it federal funds) or $9,341 per recipient, with children and adults getting less (13.5 percent and 10.1 percent respectively) and the disabled getting a lot more (51.4 percent). House spokesman Larry Berman said the source of those numbers was the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation, which collects state and federal spending data.The per-enrollee spending is 52.6 percent higher in Rhode Island than the United States. Sasse said that's where his 52 percent statement came from.But what about the per capita spending?Sasse said in an interview that when he said per capita, the population he was referring to was enrollees. However, we believe most people who hear the term will think it's based on the population in Rhode Island.Would the number be different if calculated using the general population?As a second source, he referred us to RIPEC's 2010 How Rhode Island Compares report. It's based on U.S. Census data from 2008 and looks at the cost of public welfare -- Medicaid and cash payments to the poor -- on the basis of state population. That report says public welfare costs were $2,036 per Rhode Island resident, which is 51.8 percent more than the $1,341 spent per capita nationally.If you just look at RIPEC's Medicaid numbers, as the House Finance Committee staff report did, per capita spending in Rhode Island is actually 55.8 percent more than the national average, a bit higher than Sasse said.Why does Rhode Island spend so much more?We have very high residential care costs, said Sasse, a factor others have noted.In addition, Rhode Island covers some services regarded as optional by the federal government, such as adult daycare, assisted living for the elderly and hospice care for the dying.Sasse offered no specific suggestions about what to cut. He said that's for the politicians to decide; he's just looking at the basic numbers.Fred Sneesby, spokesman for the state Department of Human Services, said in April after we published our earlier item that it's important to consider other fiscally meaningful differences among states; for example, the percentage of disabled and elderly in Rhode Island is significantly higher than in neighboring states as well as the national average.He pointed us to section of the Kaiser website, StateHealthFacts.org, showing that since the 2004 fiscal year, the state's growth in Medicaid spending has been significantly less than the U.S. average. He also said that eligibility for Rhode Island programs is as strict -- if not stricter -- than Massachusetts and Connecticut.To sum up, Sasse said Rhode Islands per capita human services spending -- by his definition, Medicaid spending per enrollee -- is 52 percent higher than the national average. By that definition, hes correct.Hes also correct in the more common use of per capita -- spending by population.As often happens, our research on this item raised questions that go beyond the statement we evaluated. Chief among them: How concerned should we be that Rhode Island spends more than the national average?Advocacy groups rarely address the question directly when they offer their reports and statistics.The 52-percent figure could mean that the state is being overly generous with its benefits.Or it could mean that the characteristics of Rhode Island's population require us to spend more to give the same level of service that other states provide.Or it could mean that the national average is depressed by states that are declining to provide some of the optional services, such as hospice care for the poor, that some Rhode Islanders might regard as anything but optional.Such context would help voters and their leaders make intelligent decisions about where to attack the problem. It would also help them ensure that our money is being spent wisely on the services we want to offer.(Get updates from PolitiFactRI on Twitter.

Final Rating: Mostly True  ","Speaking of the financial crisis that gained traction in 2007, I talked about it to anyone who would listen, a crisis is coming.","Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren warned about the financial crisis of the 2000s before it happened, she claimed during a CNN town hall where she pitched herself as the best option for president in the 2020 election. Warren, a former Harvard Law School professor, told an audience of college students that her whole lifes work has been about what's happening to working families. And starting in the early 2000s, the crisis was coming. I was waving my arms, ringing the bell, doing everything I could. I said families are getting cheated all over this country, Warren said April 22 in Manchester, N.H. It started when the mortgage companies targeted communities of color. They targeted seniors. They targeted Latinos. They came in and sold the worst possible mortgages and stripped wealth out of those communities, and then took those products across the nation. I went everywhere I could. I talked about it to anyone who would listen, a crisis is coming. But nobody wanted to listen, Warren said, so the crisis hit in 2007, 2008, and just took us down. We confirmed thatWarren did raise the alarmabout the looming housing and financial crisis. She spoke about debt, financial lending practicesand other factors affecting families and the economy years before thefinancial crisis peaked in 2008. Millions of people lost their jobs and homes during the recent Great Recession, generally regarded as happening from late 2007 to mid 2009. Experts say the financial crisis resulted from a number of colliding factors, including an unsustainable housing boom partly driven by an easy availability of mortgages, banks taking on too much risk, government policiesand lax regulation. Subprime loans — loans at higher interest rates made to people perceived to be at greater risk for defaulting on loans (including families with low and moderate income and poor credit histories) — played a key role in the housing crisis. Warrens presidential campaign cited several blog posts and comments to media outlets in 2005 and 2006, and Warrens 2003 book, The Two-Income Trap, co-authored with her daughter, Amelia Warren Tyagi, as examples of Warren warning about subprime lending and an imminent housing crisis. Warren has represented Massachusetts in the U.S. Senate since 2013. Before going to Congress, she taught law at the university level for more than 30 years, most recently at Harvard, specializing in commercial law, contracts, and bankruptcy. Subprime lenders defended their business practices by saying they were helping more families own homes, Warrens book said, but thats little more than public relations hot air. In the overwhelming majority of cases, subprime lenders prey on families that already own their own homes, rather than expanding access to new homeowners. Fully 80 percent of subprime mortgages involve refinancing loans for families that already own their homes, Warren said in the book. For these families, subprime lending does nothing more than increase the family's housing costs, taking resources away from other investments and increasing the chances that the family will lose its home if anything goes wrong. In a June 2004 interview with PBSs NOW host David Brancaccio, Warren spoke about growing household debt, against risky mortgage lending practices and what she regarded as bad advice to Americans by then-Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan. Warren said Greenspan encouraged families to borrow against their house to pay for basicexpenses. I think what the landscape shows is the middle class is under assault in a way that has not happened before in our history, Warren said. Stagnant wages, rising costs, wildly rising debt. It's in everyone's interest to turn that back around. Warrens campaign noted that The New York Times quoted Warren in an October 2005 article that said homeowners in suburbs were taking on more and more home-equity debt to stay out of bankruptcy. The article said: Professor Warren of Harvard believes that disaster lurks as homeowners borrow against their homes to forestall bankruptcy. When the stock market tumbled five years ago, people in trouble could sell stocks to stay afloat, she said. But home equity doesn't work the same way. As she put it, You can't sell a part of your home like you could a stock in the stock market bubble. Warren told the newspaper that after a new bankruptcy law went into effect that month, filing for bankruptcy would become more difficult: And that means more families are set up to lose their homes. Warren was substantially correct in her assessment that home prices were going up rapidly relative to incomes (particularly for households with a one wage earner), said Ed Pinto, co-director of the Housing Center at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank. But Pinto disagrees withWarren about what caused the crisis. Warren blames banks and lenders, when in fact Congress and government policies aimed at making homes more affordable are the root cause, Pinto said. (Check out our 2008 in-depth analysis on the causes ofthe financialcrisis and how that issuewas debatedin the 2008 presidential campaign. Then, both Sens. John McCain and Barack Obama saidthey sounded warnings, and bothblamed the other for helping cause the crisis.) Warren was also a vocal opponent of the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005, because she thought the law would hurt consumers, said Deborah Goldstein, an executive vice president at the Center for Responsible Lending, whichadvocates for consumer financial protections. Rising credit card debt hurt Americans already struggling with mortgage payments. I remember (Warren) talking about credit card abuses and how they were harming families, Goldstein said. People were using credit to manage basic daily expenses. Goldstein said that her group, also concerned about the imminent financial crisis, in the early 2000s communicated with Warren on what could be done about it. I'd give then-professor Warren the credit for banging the drum and ringing the bell early on unfair financial practices, said Ed Mierzwinski, senior director of the Federal Consumer Program at the U.S. Public Interest Research Group. Warren was the No. 1 go-to academic expert in the mid-to-late '90s and 2000s in the debate over changes to the bankruptcy code, he said. Warren in January 2007 testified before the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs, saying that the credit card market was broken and hurt consumers. Warren waschosen in 2008 to lead the Congressional Oversight Panel, established by Congress to review the state of the financial markets and the regulatory system. Warren also helped create the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. The bureau emerged from the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, designed to enforce federal consumer financial laws and protect consumers. In 2013 and 2014, Goldstein's groupcollaborated with the CFPB in drafting payday lending rules. Speaking of the financial crisis that gained traction in 2007, Warren said, I talked about it to anyone who would listen, a crisis is coming. There is documented evidence that Warren spoke against risky mortgage lending practices, rising debt and other factors that contributed to the financial and housing crisis years before it materialized.",1.0,0.0,1.0,0.8,0.0,0.0,0.3,1.0,1.0,Mostly True

Final Rating: True  ",Says Donald Trump supports eminent domain and the Supreme Courts Kelodecision.,"Slinging any pebbles they can find at the larger-than-life Donald Trump, some Republicans are taking the real estate mogul to task over his support for a legal concept called eminent domain. Eminent domain is the governments power to seize private property in order to make way for public development projects, such as highways or schools. Some conservatives oppose eminent domain because they see it as a breach of property rights. A recent ad by Club for Growth, a conservative anti-tax group, attacks Trump for his support of the practice and a related 2005 Supreme Court decision. The Supreme Courts Kelo decision gave the government massive new power to take private property and give it to corporations, the ads narrator says. Conservatives have fought this disaster. Whats Donald Trump say about the decision? The narration cuts to audio of Trump giving an interview to Fox News. I happen to agree with it 100 percent, Trump said. The narration picks back up: Trump supports eminent domain abuse because he can make millions while we lose our property rights. Is Trump an eminent domain supporter, and does he agree with the Kelo vs. New London, Conn. decision that many conservatives deride? Club for Growth described it as eminent domain abuse -- but whether the practice counts as abuse is a matter of opinion. Trump and Kelo The 2005 Kelo case concerned the government of New London, Conn., which wanted to seize several privately owned homes in order to open up the area for a major commercial development project intended to revitalize the struggling city. Several residents who didnt want to lose their homes, including a nurse named Susette Kelo, sued and argued that this proposal went beyond the governments eminent domain powers. In a liberal majority 5-4 decision, the Supreme Court found in New Londons favor. While eminent domain traditionally involves a proposal for a public -- as in government-run -- work, this decision said eminent domain could be used to make way for private commercial development. The idea was that the development qualified as a public use because it would bring jobs and tax revenues to a blighted area. At the time, Trump said he agreed with the decision, even though it was controversial. We found the July 19, 2005, transcript of the interview quoted in Club for Growths ad. Heres an excerpt of the conversation between Trump and Foxs Neil Cavuto: Cavuto: What did you think of that decision? Was the court overdoing it with that decision? Trump: Well, it's sort of not a good one for me to say, because I noticed every article written about it said, Will Donald Trump take over your home? sort of using me as the example, Neil. And it's sort of -- it's an interesting situation to be in. But I happen to agree with it 100 percent, not that I would want to use it. But the fact is, if you have a person living in an area that's not even necessarily a good area, and government, whether it's local or whatever, government wants to build a tremendous economic development, where a lot of people are going to be put to work and make an area that's not good into a good area, and move the person that's living there into a better place -- now, I know it might not be their choice -- but move the person to a better place and yet create thousands upon thousands of jobs and beautification and lots of other things, I think it happens to be good. As Trump acknowledges, he is somewhat of a poster boy for the pitfalls of eminent domain because of a high-profile case involving his property. In the late 1990s, Trump wanted to build a limousine garage to service one of his casinos in Atlantic City, N.J., but several pieces of private property were in the way -- including a home owned by a woman named Vera Coking. When Coking refused to give her property up for Trump, New Jerseys casino reinvestment authority tried to seize the house instead. The dispute ended up in front of a New Jersey court, which ruled against Trump and the government. Media regularly cited the case as an example of failed eminent domain during coverage of the Kelo case a few years later. So Trump supported eminent domain back in the mid2000s, but what does he think of it now? His current views It appears Trump holds the same position as he did back then. On Oct. 6, 2015, Foxs Bret Baier asked Trump, What do you think of eminent domain? I think eminent domain is wonderful, Trump responded, adding that as a builder, he knows better than anybody how frustrating it can be when youre building a project, and one property holds out and refuses to sell. And you need a house in a certain location because you're going to build this massive development that's going to employ thousands of people. Or you're going to build a factory that without this little house, you can't build the factory, he said. I think eminent domain is fine. Baier pushed Trump specifically on whether he still supports the Kelo decision. Trump did not respond directly to that question, though he reinforced his support for eminent domain in general and acknowledged that his position differs from that of many conservatives. I think it's a great subject -- it's a very interesting subject, Trump said. I fully understand the conservative approach, but I don't think it was explained to most conservatives. Our ruling Club for Growth said Trump supports eminent domain and the Supreme Courts Kelo decision. As recently as this week Trump has expressed support for eminent domain, and he has in the past said he agrees with the Kelo decision, which expanded the power, 100 percent.",1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,True

Final Rating: True",Texas families have kept more than $10 billion in their family budgets since we successfully fought to restore Texas' sales tax deduction a decade ago.,"A declaration about how Texans have benefited from a federal tax deduction led Austin economist Stuart Greenfield to call for the Texas Truth-O-Meter. Greenfield asked us about the accuracy of a statement by U.S. Rep. Kevin Brady, R-Houston, in a Dec. 17, 2014, press release issued after the U.S. Senate agreed with the House to extend the ability of Texas taxpayers to deduct sales taxes on federal income tax returns. Brady, a senior member of the tax-writing House Ways and Means Committee, said: Texas families have kept more than $10 billion in their family budgets since we successfully fought to restore Texas' sales tax deduction a decade ago. Greenfield speculated the $10 billion figure was an overstatement. Congressmans back-up information To our inquiry, Brady spokeswoman Tracee Evans pointed out a news story posted online Sept. 22, 2014, by the Dallas Morning News. That story said that according to the Texas state comptrollers office, if Congress failed to extend the option of deducting state and local sales taxes, Texans would owe an extra $1.2 billion to the IRS in April 2015. Evans emailed us: If its $1.2 billion a year, extrapolate that over ten years and what do you get? In most states, the News story noted, taxpayers can deduct state income tax payments from their federal tax bill. And since 2004, Congress has let taxpayers in states with no income tax — Texas and six others — deduct state and local sales taxes instead. In 2012, the story said, 2.3 million Texas filers (about one in five) used the sales tax deduction with the average deduction for those who claimed it being $1,906, according to a September 2014 Pew Charitable Trusts report. We asked the comptrollers office about the cited estimate. By phone, spokesman Chris Bryan said its revenue-estimating experts reached the $1.2 billion figure by taking the total amount deducted by Texans for sales tax in 2012 -- $4,353,996,000 -- and multiplying that by what its experts calculated to be the average marginal tax rate that year, 27 percent. So, the calculation suggests, Texans who took the deduction in 2012 reduced their federal income taxes by an estimated $1.18 billion all together. (We ran the same numbers, starting from an IRS chart showing federal taxes paid by Texas residents in 2012, reaching the same result.) In October 2007, Evans pointed out, State Comptroller Susan Combs estimated the deduction was saving Texans $1 billion a year. Bryan told us, though, the office doesnt routinely estimate the effect of the deduction and doesnt have a 10-year impact figure. Greenfield, apprised of the comptrollers approach, said its methodology and Bradys cumulative figure seemed to add up after all. Texas tax expert: Beneficiaries tend to be higher-income earners Separately, Dick Lavine, a tax analyst for the liberal Austin-based Center for Public Policy Priorities, stressed by email that Texans at higher income levels disproportionately enjoy the deduction, which only helps taxpayers who itemize deductions. In 2012, 39 percent of Texas filers with adjusted gross incomes of $75,000 to $100,000 took the deduction; 14 percent of filers with earnings of $25,000 to $50,000 did so. Lavine pointed out, too, that Texans deducted $3.2 billion in 2004, the first year the deduction was restored, which might indicate the value of the deduction in reduced taxes over 10 years might be less than $10 billion, he said, especially if the marginal tax rate on average was 25 percent. PolitiFact estimate To reach a savings estimate of our own, we added up all the sales tax deductions claimed by Texas residents for 2004 through 2012, as reported by the IRS. A figure for 2013 has yet to be posted by the agency so we reached an estimate for that year based on averaging what Texans deducted in 2010, 2011 and 2012. All this ultimately led us to estimate the Texas deductions over the decade totaled nearly $40 billion. Next, we calculated the likely tax savings -- that is, money not paid by Texas residents to Uncle Sam thanks to these deductions. Assuming the 27 percent marginal tax rate applied by the comptrollers office to 2012, the deduction would have left $10.8 billion in Texas pocketbooks over the 10 years. At a 25 percent marginal rate, Texans money not spent on federal taxes would have amounted to nearly $10 billion ($9.998 billion, by our calculation.) Asked to comment on our calculations, Alan Cole, an economist for the Washington, D.C.-based Tax Foundation, a non-partisan tax policy research organization, emailed that he would have taken a similar tack. He also cautioned, though, that individuals who take the deduction tend to earn more and hence have higher marginal tax rates, which could justify a larger 10-year savings estimate. Our ruling Brady said: Texas families have kept more than $10 billion in their family budgets since we successfully fought to restore Texas' sales tax deduction a decade ago. While thats a squishy figure -- an estimate that cant be pinned as a fact unless you somehow divine every Texans marginal tax rate for each of the 10 years, for starters -- it appears to be reasonable. Its also so that families that had these savings were mostly better off; lower-income taxpayers tend not to itemize deductions.

Final Rating: True  ",Says he has issued more pardons than any Wisconsin governor in contemporary history.,"During his eight years in office, former Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, a Republican, did not issue a single pardon. In contrast, his successor – Democrat Tony Evers – touts every one he grants. Last week, I granted another 54 pardons, bringing our total to 391 — more than any Wisconsin governor in contemporary history, Evers said in a Jan 13, 2022, news release. On Feb. 7, 2022, he issued another release, setting the number at 416. Pardons, of course, can restore certain civil rights and privileges and relieve some legal issues. They differ from clemency or sentence commutations, which would allow a person to leave prison early. Pardons under Evers have included low-level drug dealers, long-ago drunk driving cases, mistakes made as youth and more. Among other things, a pardon can make it easier for people to get jobs. Is Evers right that the number is the most in contemporary history? The key word in Evers claim, of course, is contemporary. Evers spokeswoman Britt Cudaback said in a Feb. 1, 2022, email that the governors office looked at the past 40 years. They also said they considered Evers contemporaries to be any previous governors still living today. In that timeframe, only Gov. Jim Doyle, a Democrat, came close to granting the same number of pardons — 326, according to the Wisconsin Legislative Reference Bureau. But he did it over eight years in office. Here is a look at how various governors compare: Looking beyond that 40-year period, Gov. Patrick Lucey, a Democratwho served from 1971 to 1977, issued at least 392 pardons. We say at least 392 because tracking pardons requires reviewing Senate and Assembly journals or records held with the Wisconsin Secretary of State. And the exact figure for each governor may vary depending on who collected the information and how it was done. For instance, numbers of pardons issued per governor provided by Evers differed from those provided by the Wisconsin Legislative Reference Bureau. The governors office said Lucey issued 457 pardons through his six years in office. The bureau says the number was 392. For our figures, we are relying on the reference bureau, which compiles information on pardons, commutations and reprieves through the past couple years. The bureau has an ongoing effort to tabulate historical information on the use of executive clemency throughout all Wisconsin history. To find a governor who issued more pardons than Evers or Lucey, you would have to go back to Gov. Julius Heil, a Republican, who served from 1939 to 1943. At the time, Wisconsin governors served two-year terms. In his first term, Heil granted 486 pardons and another 448 in his second term, for a total of 934, according to the Legislative Reference Bureau. Evers said hes issued the most pardons in Wisconsin contemporary history. As of Feb. 7, 2022, Evers had issued 416 pardons. In the last 40 years, only Doyle came close to granting the same number of pardons — 326. To find a governor who issued more, youd have to go back to Julius Heil, whose term ended 79 years ago.

Final Rating: True  ",Says his release of 33 years of tax returns is more than any presidential candidate in history.,"Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush released 33 years of tax returns, casting it as the high water mark of transparency for presidential hopefuls. Today, Im releasing 33 years of tax returns – more than any presidential candidate in history, Bush said on his website. He also bragged about it on Twitter. The returns run from 1981 to 2013. We wondered if Bushs 33 years was indeed the most ever, and that does appear to be the case. We also found its highly unusual for a candidate to share so many returns, especially so early in the campaign. The previous record was held by Sen. Bob Dole, R-Kan., who won the Republican nomination to run against President Bill Clinton in 1996. In January of that year, Dole released 29 years of tax returns, stretching from 1966 to 1994. He added 1995 in April, for a grand total of 30 years. Most of Doles ire at the time was directed at primary rival, publisher Steve Forbes, who was reticent about revealing his finances. Dole took the opportunity to rebuke his opponent for pushing for a flat tax. The next highest number of releases was Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., who released a total of 20 years of returns: five years worth of returns in April 2004, adding to 15 years of returns he had revealed in prior Senate races. Critics of Kerrys campaign were more concerned that his independently wealthy wife, millionaire Teresa Heinz Kerry, wouldnt give out her returns. (She eventually provided two pages of her 2003 return.) There is no law requiring candidates to show their tax returns, but it has become common practice since Jimmy Carter became president in 1976. The releases have been far from uniform, however, down to when candidates make their returns public. Bush is an outlier for providing so many returns so early in the campaign, as the lions share of candidates usually wait until the year of the election to give out their information. The amount of documentation also has varied widely from person to person. George Romney released 12 years in 1968, as did Bill Clinton in 1992. Sen. John Edwards, D-N.C., gave out 10 when he was Kerrys running mate in 2004. The numbers then dwindle, from George W. Bush (nine in 2000) and Al Gore (eight the same year) to Sen. Barack Obama, D-Ill., and Hillary Clinton, who both released seven in 2008. Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., and Mitt Romney both released two years during their campaigns. In 1980, Ronald Reagan only provided one. Releasing tax information is often a part of campaign strategy, usually to force other candidates to reveal their finances. But even then, the move can draw criticism. Liberal political action committee American Bridge 21st Century posted a laundry list of questions about the former Florida governors business dealings on the same day he released his returns. Bushs 1,150 pages of financial documents show that the former real estate executives net worth dropped from about $2 million to $1.3 million during his two terms as governor. The campaign said he is currently worth between $19 million and $22 million. He has earned at least $29 million since leaving office in 2007. Our ruling Bush said his release of 33 years of tax returns is more than any presidential candidate in history. That really is the case. The next highest total by a presidential candidate is from Dole, who released 30 years worth during his 1996 presidential campaign.",1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,True

Final Rating: True  ","When (John) Brennan ... was asked directly  Is there any geographic limitation to your drone strike program? Brennan responded and said, no, there is no limitation.","When Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., staged his historic filibuster over 13 hours on March 6, 2013, he said he just wanted answers.He wanted President Barack Obamas administration to definitively say whether the use of armed drones could ever be justified on American soil. During his epic stand on the Senate floor, which only ended with the inevitable call of nature, Paul cited several statements made by administration officials that concerned him -- including one by CIA Director nominee John Brennan. When Brennan, whose nomination I am opposing today, was asked directly, 'Is there any limit to your killing? Is there any geographic limitation to your drone strike program?' Brennan responded and said, 'no, there is no limitation,' Paul said during the first hour of filibustering. Paul's issue was about the possibility of drone strikes in the United States. After his filibuster, Attorney General Eric Holder addressed Paul's concerns in a letter. Holder wrote that the president does not have the authority to use a weaponized drone to kill an American not engaged in combat on American soil. In looking over Paul's statements during the filibuster, we wondered: Did Paul accurately characterize Brennans answer about geographic limitations to drone use in the global terror fight? Did Brennan say there was no geographic limitation? We reached out to Pauls office but did not hear back. Still, we found three instances of Brennan addressing that issue.In a speech in April 2012 at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars, Brennan -- acknowledging the administrations drone program for the first time publicly -- said drone strikes could be necessary outside of the battlefield. At the time he was Obamas point person on counterterrorism strategy.There is nothing in international law that bans the use of remotely piloted aircraft for this purpose or that prohibits us from using lethal force against our enemies outside of an active battlefield, at least when the country involved consents or is unable or unwilling to take action against the threat, he said.In February 2013, ahead of hearings before the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence to confirm him as CIA director, Brennan reiterated that belief in response to written questions.Question: Would you support legislation to authorize the use of force outside of hot battlefields and codify the standards for the conduct of targeted strikes, including through the use of remotely piloted aircraft? Why or why not?Brennan replied: On your question about whether I would support legislation to authorize the use of force outside of hot battlefields, I believe we currently have the authority to take action in such circumstances against al-Qaida and associated forces. As Jeh Johnson, the former General Counsel of the Department of Defense, indicated in a lecture at Yale Law School in February of last year, the 2001 Authorization for the Use of Military Force does not contain a geographical limitation. Consequently I do not believe additional legislation along these lines is necessary.And in more written questions after his confirmation hearing, Brennan was again asked about geographical limits on the administrations drone strikes.He noted, in part, the government has a responsibility to protect its citizens from these attacks, and, thus, as the attorney general has noted, neither Congress nor our federal courts has limited the geographic scope of our ability to use force to the current conflict in Afghanistan.But he went on to say: This does not mean, however, that we use military force whenever or wherever we want. International legal principles, such as respect for another nations sovereignty, constrain our ability to act unilaterally. Using force in another country is consistent with these international legal principles if conducted, for example, with the consent of the relevant nation – or if or when other governments are unwilling or unable to deal effectively with a threat to the United States.We ran this issue by Paul Pillar, a former CIA official who now teaches at Georgetown University. He responded: Sen. Paul's comment is a generally correct characterization of Brennan's answer regarding the absence of any geographic limitation on the administration's authority to conduct strikes. Brennan's further remark about other considerations coming into play is a way of saying that the administration does not wantonly conduct strikes around the world, but those considerations do not constitute a geographic limitation. Our rulingPaul said during the filibuster, When Brennan, whose nomination I am opposing today, was asked directly,  Is there any geographic limitation to your drone strike program? Brennan responded and said, no, there is no limitation.We found three instances when Brennan cited legal opinion asserting no geographic limit on where the United States can use drones against terrorists. He did add that the absence of a geographic limit does not mean drones can be used whenever or wherever -- that international legal principles still apply. But we agree with Pillar that that addendum doesnt amount to a geographic limitation.Pauls characterization of Brennans comments is accurate.",1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,True

Final Rating: Mostly True  ","In nine Democratic debates, We've not had one question about a woman's right to make her own decisions about reproductive health care, not one question.","Hillary Clinton said abortion has been ignored during the Democratic debates. Clinton got on the topic during the April 14 debate in Brooklyn, N.Y., when she said she would only appoint a Supreme Court justice who believed that Roe vs. Wade is settled law. And I want to say something about this since we're talking about the Supreme Court and what's at stake. We've had eight debates before, this is our ninth, Clinton said. We've not had one question about a woman's right to make her own decisions about reproductive health care, not one question. The line got a big applause from the audience. But was it correct? Abortion and debates We found no questions directly about abortion in nine debate transcripts, although at times the candidates brought up the topic themselves. We searched for the words abortion, Planned Parenthood and pro-choice in debate transcripts in Washington Post transcripts: Oct. 13, Las Vegas: Clinton said the Republicans don't mind having big government to interfere with a woman's right to choose and to try to take down Planned Parenthood. Nov. 14, Des Moines: Speaking about the Democratic candidates, Clinton said all of us support funding Planned Parenthood. Dec. 19, New Hampshire: Clinton mentioned that a police officer was killed responding to Planned Parenthood murders and said that Republicans would defund Planned Parenthood. Jan. 17, South Carolina: No mentions. Feb. 4, New Hampshire: No mentions. Feb. 11, Milwaukee: No abortion questions were asked. Sanders said he had a lifetime 100 percent pro-choice voting record, and Clinton touted her endorsement by the Planned Parenthood Action Fund. March 6, Flint: No mentions. March 9, Miami: The candidates were not asked their views on abortion, but a moderator mentioned that the Supreme Court was considering the most significant abortion restrictions in a generation. But the question was about what qualifications Clinton would look for in a Supreme Court justice. April 14, New York: In the ninth debate, Clinton said governors are trying to restrict women's rights and that Donald Trump said women should be punished for abortion.  And we are never asked about this, she said. And to be complete in my concern, Sen. Sanders says with respect to Trump it was a distraction. I don't think it's a distraction. It goes to the heart of who we are as women, our rights, our autonomy, our ability to make our own decisions, and we need to be talking about that and defending Planned Parenthood from these outrageous attacks. Sanders replied: You're looking at a senator and former congressman who proudly has a 100 percent pro-choice voting record, who will take on those Republican governors who are trying to restrict a woman's right to choose... He called for expanding funding for Planned Parenthood. Several news articles including by the Washington Post, MSNBC, TIME, Vox stated that during the Democratic debates moderators havent asked about abortion. A spokesman for NARAL Pro-Choice America, James Owens, told PolitiFact, It is correct that there has not been a single question about abortion in any of the Democratic debates. NARAL has advocated for Democratic moderators to ask about abortion, including a campaign on Twitter #AskAboutAbortion. Before the New York debate, NARAL sent a letter to CNN moderator Wolf Blitzer urging him to ask about abortion. Renee Bracey Sherman, a board member at NARAL, wrote a column for Glamour posted the day of the New York debate that argued that even though they both support abortion, there are questions that should be asked about their positions: Will abortion be covered in Sanders Medicare-For-All plan? How will Clinton direct the Department of Justice to respond to the record number of attacks on providers? Will their administration step in to stop the prosecution of those who are self inducing their abortions? How will the candidates stop states from closing abortion clinics? Will their immigration policy ensure undocumented people are able to access abortion care? How will they ensure everyone is able to access safe, affordable abortion care in their community? There was a town hall, however, where the moderator brought up abortion, a spokesman for Clinton told us. In a Fox News town hall March 7, moderator Brett Baier asked Sanders and Clinton questions about abortion. Baier asked Sanders: Can you name a single circumstance at any point in a pregnancy in which you would be OK with abortion being illegal? Sanders replied: I happen to believe that it is wrong for the government to be telling a woman what to do with her own body. He then posed a similar question to Clinton: Do you think a child should have any legal rights or protections before it's born? Or do you think there should not be any restrictions on any abortions at any stage in a pregnancy? Clinton replied that she supports abortion rights. I have been on record in favor of a late pregnancy regulation that would have exceptions for the life and health of the mother, she said. Our ruling Clinton says in nine Democratic debates We've not had one question about a woman's right to make her own decisions about reproductive health care, not one question. We could not find any example of a moderator asking a direct question about abortion, however Clinton and Sanders both raised the topic in multiple debates.",0.9,0.1,1.0,0.8,0.2,0.3,0.5,1.0,0.9,Mostly True

Final Rating: True  ",Things went wrong with the Medicare prescription D plan that George Bush rolled out.,"Democrats are pleading for patience as they try to reassure the country that the online insurance marketplaces critical to President Barack Obamas health care overhaul can be fixed. Big programs have seen rocky rollouts only to achieve success later, they say. Their top example:the 2005 launch of Medicare Part D, President George W. Bushs prescription drug benefit plan. Things went wrong with the Medicare prescription D plan that George Bush rolled out, Rep. Steve Israel, D-N.Y., told MSNBC on Nov. 6. When things go wrong, there are two things we can do as a country. We can spend all our time figuring out who to blame, or we can spend all our time figuring out how to fix it. Eight years after it went live, Medicare Part D is nowwidely popularamong the seniors who use it. Were there major problems with the rollout of Medicare Part D? And were they comparable to the challenges facing Obamacare? We decided to take a more a detailed look at its implementation. Strangely similar Lets play a quick game: who made this statement? This is a huge undertaking and there are going to be glitches. My goal is the same as yours: Get rid of the glitches. A Democrat in 2013? Wrong!Actually, it wasRep. Joe Barton, a Texas Republican who chaired the House Energy and Commerce Committee, about Medicare Part Din 2006. The similarities between the two health care programs, both heralded as the signature domestic achievements of the presidents who signed them into law, are at times eerie. Supporters of the laws asked for time and promised a quick fix. Critics did not mince their words. Even the lingo -- words like glitches -- has been recycled. Areport documenting the history of Medicare Part D was released earlier this year bya group of health policy experts at the Center on Health Insurance Reform at Georgetown University. It highlighted several areas where Medicare Part D struggled in its implementation that sound extremely familiar. For one thing, the Bush administration faced a difficult political battle to get the bill passed in 2003. That damaged public opinion of the law, making it a challenge to educate 43 million seniors on its nuances. Enrollment in the law was set to begin in late 2005. In April of that year, a Kaiser Family Foundation poll found that only 27 percent of respondents understood the law, while only 21 percent favored it. (In a comparable Kaiser poll in April 2013, 35 percent viewed the Affordable Care Act favorably and less than half felt they were well-informed of its details.) The Medicare site, meant to help seniors pick benefit plans, was supposed to debut Oct. 13, 2005, but it didntgo live until weeks later in November. Even then, the tool itself appeared to be in need of fixing, theWashington Postreportedat the time. Visitors to the site could not access it for most of the first two hours. When it finally did come up around 5 p.m., it operated awfully slowly, thePostreported. (Sensing a pattern?) Once seniors began to enroll, problems persisted. According to the report, the online tools had accuracy problems, and local organizations designated with assisting seniors reported problems getting necessary and accurate information. Call centers provided by the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services underestimated the needed capacity to ensure that reliable answers could be provided and service representatives were not knowledgeable or failed to provide accurate information. The Georgetown experts anticipated similar hiccups with the Affordable Care Act, noting that the countrys experience with Medicare Part D suggested the experience will be far from perfect and problems were not always addressed as quickly or as thoroughly as critics would have liked, but fixes were usually found. These days,nine in 10 seniors who utilize the program report they are satisfied with it. Theres really a striking amount of similarity even though this time its a far larger and daunting task. Its a fair comparison, said Jack Hoadley at the Georgetown University's Health Policy Institute and one of the authors of the study. Once something works its way through the problems, you forget the problems. Still different But there are important differences between Medicare Part D and the Affordable Care Act that make the challenges facing the exchanges different. Because it was aimed at seniors and e-commerce was still relatively young, Medicare.gov was not intended to be the main hub for people to purchase and review plans, said David Brailer, the first National Coordinator for Health Information Technology under Bush. The issue with Medicare Part D is there were choices of 70 to 100 plans, Brailer said. People were overwhelmed with the choices, with the options available and didn't know how to navigate and pick one. I dont remember a conversation at all blaming any IT people. This was about how do you really navigate through all these choices. Meanwhile, most people who logged on to healthcare.gov in the opening weeks couldnt even get far enough to review what options were available. Also, prescription drugs are a relatively small and easy-to-understand part of health care. Shopping for an insurance plan is more complicated. For those who did choose to enroll (in Medicare Part D) online, they checked out their options by typing in drugs they used, and once you did, you got an estimated out-of-pocket cost to make your comparisons. In the exchange world you have a full health care benefit to buy, Hoadley said. The drug cost is relatively predictable, certainly a lot more predictable than overall health costs. The challenge for this website is a lot greater, probably by a significant amount of magnitude. And theres the political climate as well. When Medicare Part D passed, Democrats were not happy with the final bill and were critical of its botched rollout. But even then, they were generally supportive of its intended outcome and worked with constituents who had difficulty signing up or utilizing their new benefits. When Medicare Part D faced early troubles, many blue states came to its rescue. The New York Timesreportedin 2006 that about 20 states, including California, Illinois, Ohio, Pennsylvania and all of New England, have announced that they will help low-income people by paying drug claims that should have been paid by the federal Medicare program. By contrast, not a single Republican voted for the Affordable Care Act, and in the years since it passed, the party has made its repeal a top priority. In the states, many Republican governors have bucked the Medicaid expansion and rejected offers to build their own insurance marketplaces, putting greater pressure on the federal government. Henry Aaron, a health policy expert at the Brookings Institute, said the opposition from Republicans has forced the Obama administration into a two-front war Bush did not have to fight. On the one hand, one must and should address the administrative problems that no one denies is plaguing the problem, he said. But youre also waging a war of public opinion against the hysterics of its critics. Our ruling Israel said, Things went wrong with the Medicare prescription D plan that George Bush rolled out. There definitely were problems, and in some cases, the parallels between the prescription benefit programs introduction and the Obamacare marketplaces are strikingly similar. While we also found some serious differences in the laws, we cant find fault with Israels fairly general statement.",1.0,0.0,1.0,0.8,0.0,0.0,0.2,1.0,1.0,True

Final Rating: True",We're borrowing 40 cents of every dollar we spend.,"Government borrowing needs to be brought back under control, and the solutions are not easy, said Sen. Kent Conrad, D-N.D., on This Week with Christiane Amanpour.The American people say, don't touch Social Security, don't touch Medicare, don't cut defense, Conrad said. That's 84 percent of the federal budget. If you can't touch 84 percent of the federal budget -- and, by the way, they also don't want to touch revenue -- you're down to 16 percent of the budget at a time we're borrowing 40 cents of every dollar we spend.So, you know, there needs to be leadership to help the American people understand how serious this problem is and that it's going to take a lot more than cutting foreign aid and taxing the rich. You're not going to solve the problem that way.Conrad was one of three senators who appeared on This Week to discuss bipartisanship. Sen. Joe Lieberman, I-Conn., and Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas, also appeared. All three have announced they intend to retire in 2012.We wanted to check Conrad's statement that we're borrowing 40 cents of every dollar we spend. We looked at whether Social Security, Medicare and defense constituted 84 percent of the federal budget in a different fact-check.We turned to the U.S. Treasury Department's Monthly Treasury Statement of Receipts and Outlays of the United States Government. For the most recently completed fiscal year, 2010, the department reported that the government had revenues of $2.16 trillion, spending of $3.46 trillion and a deficit of $1.29 trillion. Divide the deficit by the outlays and you get 37 percent, which is very close to 40 percent.We initially found the numbers a little confusing, but one of the experts we interviewed for this story explained it this way:It's like a family that earns $60,000 per year, but is spending $100,000. How are they doing it? By getting a new $40,000 loan every year to cover the difference, said Brian Riedl, a budget expert with the conservative Heritage Foundation.In rating Conrad's statement, we find he correctly described how much the government is borrowing in comparison with what it's spending.",1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,True

Final Rating: True  ","100,000 Americans died of an overdose in a single year.","Days afterthe U.S. reached 900,000 total COVID-19 deaths, U.S. Sen. JohnCornyn,R-Texas, highlighted another morbid statistic. Hetweeted on Feb. 14, We recently found out our nation hit a grim milestone: 100,000 Americans died of an overdose in a single year. He also linked this statistic to President Joe Biden's border policy and wrote, Pres. Bidens open borders policies are letting drugs like Fentanyl pour into our communities. This cannot go on - we must secure the border. Is it true that 100,000 Americans died of overdose in a single year? PolitiFact Texas took a look. Cornyn's office pointed toa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Nov. 17 newsreleaseand aFeb. 13 article by The New York Timescitingthat November release. The National Center for Health Statistics estimated there were more than 100,300 drug overdose deaths nationallyin a 12-month period ending April 2021. That matches what Cornyn said. Compared to the same period the year prior, drug overdose deaths had increased 28.5%. Data released Feb. 16 indicate an estimated 104,288Americans died from drug overdoses from September 2020 to September 2021, according to CDC media relations. Marcia Ory,Texas A&M University School of Public Health professorandco-chair of Texas A&M's Opioid Task Force, believesthat number may be an undercount. Ory said she sees that to be the case in Texas' rural counties. Texas has very few medical examiners in all of our 254 counties, so we already know that it's often a justice of the peace or someone who's not medically trained, Ory said. Because of that the symptoms of an overdose death might be interpreted as cardiac failure, respiratory problems. According to 2019 posts by the Texas Medical Association, only 15 of Texas' 254 counties have populations large enough to have a medical examiner's office. Cornyn's tweet included a video of his remarksin the Feb. 14 Senate session, where he described how opioid overdose deaths are driving drug overdose deaths and how the drug overdose death rate changed from 2018 to 2020. Scott Walters— professor at theUniversity of North Texas Health Science Center at Fort Worthanda leaderin a National Institutes of Health-backed initiative to stem the opioid crisis—said Cornyn'scharacterization of overdose deaths decreasing in 2018, increasing in 2019, and skyrocketing in 2020 was right. Cornyn's right that in 2018 we had seen a slow decrease, slow slide, of drug overdose deaths. That's absolutely true. But coinciding with the start of the pandemic, we saw a sharp increase in the number of overdose deaths, Walterssaid. When it comes to drug overdose deaths, the driver of the increase is opioid use. The CDC press release indicated deaths from opioids increased by 35% from theone-year period ending in April 2020 to the one ending in April2021. Cornyn specifically emphasized fentanyl use. Fentanyl is a synthetic opioid that, even in small amounts, can be lethal.The Department of Justicedescribesfentanyl practically and effectively 50 and 100 times more potent than heroin or prescription opioidson its public awareness webpage on opioids. Cornyn wrote in his tweet,Pres. Bidens open borders policies are letting drugs like Fentanyl pour into our communities. This cannot go on - we must secure the border. Cornyn said he believed Customs and Border Protection agents' focus on an influx of migrants hasdetracted from drug interdiction efforts. It's important to note, however, that the one-year period cited by Cornyn's office started during Donald Trump's presidency and ended roughly three months after Biden took office. U.S. Customs and Border Protection in South Texas saw a 1,066% increase in fentanyl seized in fiscal year 2021,according to a January press release from the agency. Mexico and China were the primary source for fentanyl trafficked into the U.S. in 2019,according to a 2020 report by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration. Starting with the beginning of the pandemic and the lockdown, what happened was that the normal —the so-called normal — supply routes for heroin were all pinched. It was just plain more difficult to get heroin anymore, Walters said. So people started to shiftduring the pandemic, Walters said. You saw a shift from heroin and prescription pill-based products to more synthetic products. Synthetic opioids like fentanyl, Walters said. That's responsible for the increase. Jane Maxwell,a University of Texas professor who monitors drug use patternsin Texas, said there is not a lot of data available on users, despite fentanyl'slink to many recent drug overdose deaths. While Cornyn pointed to Biden's border policy as part of the problem, Walters said he isn't sure open borders is the problem. Walters noted people have been moving substances across the border for years, and fentanyl is smaller and easier to conceal. Walters said he believes drug awareness campaigns need to be rethought. Well-established public health education tactics, like forpublic education on the dangers of smoking, assume people have a long time to use drugs before something terrible happens. That long period of time allowsmore opportunities to cut down or quit. With fentanyl, lethal doses are much smaller. It's a lot more like a poison in circulation. And we ought to be thinking more about a poison control solution rather than a stereotypical drug use campaign, Walters said. Cornyn tweeted on Feb. 14, We recently found out our nation hit a grim milestone: 100,000 Americans died of an overdose in a single year. While Cornyn did not specify which year in the tweet, the most recent data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention support this.",1.0,0.0,1.0,0.8,0.0,0.2,0.2,1.0,1.0,True

Final Rating: Half True  ",Greg Abbott defended more than $5 billion in public school funding cuts in fighting hundreds of school districts in court.,"When Republican gubernatorial candidate Greg Abbott visited a Dallas-area school district, the leading Democratic aspirant cried foul. As Greg Abbott visits a Plano ISD school today its unlikely that he will apologize to students for defending school budget cuts and fighting against their school district in court, state Sen. Wendy Davis said in a Dec. 3, 2013, post on her campaign website. Greg Abbotts actions speak louder than his words. While I fought against over $5 billion in unconstitutional budget cuts to our public schools, Davis said, Abbott wasted taxpayer funds to defend those cuts in court. Davis, a Fort Worth state senator, helped force a special legislative session in 2011 by filibustering, and temporarily delaying, a decision by the revenue-strapped Republican-majority Legislature to reduce education funding by more than $5 billion through 2012-13. And did Abbott, the states attorney general, defend the cuts in court? Thats been acknowledged. Abbott was quoted during his Dec. 3, 2013, Plano visit as telling the Dallas Morning News the reason hes defending the cuts is because the Legislature passed them and its his job to defend them. The attorney general in Texas takes an oath of office to defend the laws passed by the legislature, Abbott said, according to the News. Im fulfilling that duty. That news story came to our attention in an email from Davis campaign spokeswoman Rebecca Acuña, who responded to our request for the basis of Davis statement with a document listing web links to additional news stories as well as legal filings by Abbotts office in defending the school funding system in the latest round of litigation likely headed to the Texas Supreme Court. In February 2013, a Travis County state district judge, John Dietz, ruled the system unconstitutional, though he later reacted to legislative actions restoring $3.4 billion in spending cuts and easing mandated high-school tests by scheduling fresh hearings for early 2014, the Austin American-Statesman reported in a news story posted online June 19, 2013. A vital issue in the original trial, the Statesman said in a news story posted online Oct. 20, 2012, was the charge by two-thirds of the states school districts accounting for three-quarters of Texas students that the state was failing to ensure that districts had adequate resources to bring students up to what lawmakers handed down in tougher academic expectations. Texas districts have litigated how the state funds the schools for decades. Each time, expert lawyers told us, the state attorney general has defended the existing law just as Abbott has in the latest legal battle, which is expected to resume in early 2014. Thats in keeping with the duties of the attorney general as specified in the Texas Constitution, which says the attorney general shall represent the state in all suits and pleas in the Supreme Court of the state in which the state may be a party. Lawyers representing groups of districts in the latest lawsuits each said it would be unusual for an attorney general not to defend a state law and related legislative decisions. Buck Wood of Austin, who has long represented property-poor districts in school finance suits, said deputies to Abbott vigorously defended the law during the latest trial before Dietz. Austin lawyer Rick Gray, representing some 400 districts in the latest litigation, said he could not recall any attorney general backing down from defending the school finance system through the decades of court battles. David Thompson of Houston, who represents districts (including the Austin one) serving more than 1.8 million children, stressed that Abbotts office has defended the constitutionality of the funding system and the legislated cuts, not necessarily speaking to whether the spending reductions were good policy. The attorney generals office is actively and I would say vigorously defending the states actions, Thompson said. That would include specifically the cuts to funding as well as just the overall design and structure of the (funding) system. The lawyers each added that while its an attorney generals duty to defend the state and actions taken on behalf of the state, he or she also has discretion to settle cases. Our search of news stories and Abbott-issued press releases yielded no sign of Abbott personally appearing in the courtroom during the latest school funding trial. At our request, Catherine Clark, an administrator for the Texas Association of School Boards, reviewed her notes from the trial. By telephone, Clark said she found no instances of state attorneys defending the 2011 cuts in education aid except to elicit testimony that the reductions were less dramatic than other state budget cuts that year. I dont see them standing up there and saying, gosh, we needed to make those cuts, Clark said. But they did admit there were cuts. We asked a spokeswoman for the attorney general, Lauren Bean, if Davis is correct that Abbott has defended the 2011 cuts in the school funding lawsuits. By email, Bean said yes, Abbotts office defended the law in court. In a follow-up email, she listed court rulings specifying the attorney general has an exclusive role in representing state agencies. Our ruling Davis said Abbott defended more than $5 billion in cuts in public school funding in fighting hundreds of school districts in court. Thats factually correct as far as it goes, but this claim is missing important details and context in that the state attorney general has a legal duty to represent the state in challenges reaching the Texas Supreme Court, which the latest school finance lawsuits are expected to do. It would be unusual for an attorney general not to defend a law and legislative actions in such a suit.

Final Rating: Half True  ",The public option is not funded with public money. It's funded with private insurance premiums.,"Amid debate over a health reform bill, the House adopted new restrictions on funding abortions, and Democratic congresswoman Diana DeGette is not happy about the development.As chairwoman of the Pro-Choice Caucus, DeGette of Colorado is upset that under the bill low-income individuals would not be able to use federal subsidies to buy abortion coverage through a health insurance exchange. Furthermore, a government-run health insurance option would not offer abortion coverage except in the case of rape, incest or when the life of the mother is endangered.Here's what she had to say about the issue on the Nov. 9, 2009, episode of theRachel Maddow Showon MSNBC.Nobody in the public option would be able to get an insurance policy that offered abortion coverage, she said. And we need to remember, the public option is not funded with public money. It's funded with private insurance premiums. So, let's say you have a small business owner who goes in to the public option because they can't get insurance anyplace else, and they want to buy a policy with their own private money, no federal money, that they would be banned from doing that.We'vealready exploredthe second part of DeGette's claim, that small businesses and individuals would not be able to buy abortion coverage through the exchange, and found it to be False. In fact, insurers can still offer abortion coverage through the exchange so long as the administrative structure behind it is not supported by federal money, and individuals can buy abortion coverage through the exchange so long as they use their own money.So, for this fact-check, we'll focus on DeGette's other point -- that the public option is funded by private insurance premiums, not public money.The public option has turned out to be the most controversial part of the health care reform. It's a government-run option for people buying insurance on the individual market, not through their employer, and it would be one of many plans offered through a new insurance exchange -- think of it as a one-stop shop for consumers where they can compare costs and benefits between plans. The hope is to increase competition and accountability within the insurance industry.So far, the Senate version of the bill does not include a public option, but Democratic Leader Harry Reid says the bill that comes to the Senate floor will likely include such a plan.The public option has become a flashpoint between Republican opponents of the bill and its Democratic advocates, in part because members of the GOP see it as a government effort to socialize medicine and too expensive. And now that the House has adopted an amendment that officially severed any ties between the public option and abortion coverage, tension between lawmakers on both sides of the abortion debate has only intensified.DeGette's point is that the public plan isn't really public at all because it will be sustained through premiums paid by consumers, so it should not exclude abortion coverage.We looked into exactly how the public option would be funded, and here's what we found: According to the House Energy and Commerce Committee, which has jurisdiction over the plan, the public option would be administered through the Department of Health and Human Services, and it would negotiate rates with providers in the public option. To make sure the public plan doesn't have an unfair advantage, the bill requires that the plan be self-sustaining; funding would come from the premiums consumers pay to get coverage.But the feds aren't exactly off the hook. The government will front the operation $2 billion to cover initial administrative costs and claims, though lawmakers expect that sum will be recouped after the program has been in operation for 10 years.So DeGette is right and she's wrong. In the long-term, the public option is meant to be self-sustaining. But first, it will require a big chunk of of public money to get started.

Final Rating: Half True  ",The United States is 65th out of 142 nations and other territories on equal pay.,"Hillary Clinton, who wants to become the first woman ever to win the presidency of the United States, gave an address recently at the Women in the World Summit that touched on the gap in pay between men and women in the United States. Its hard to believe that so many women are still paid less for men than the same work, with even wider gaps for women of color. If you doubt what I say, look to the World Economic Forum, hardly a hotbed of feminist thought, Clinton said at the April 23, 2015, summit. Their rankings show that the United States is 65th out of 142 nations and other territories on equal pay. Imagine that. We should be No. 1. That sounds pretty bad for a nation thats considered the worlds economic superpower. We wondered whether the United States is really that far back in the pack. We found a more complex picture than Clintons comments showed. One study that surveyed executives supported her point, but another study of wage data actually undermined it. Framing the wage gap question PolitiFact has written frequently in the past about how much of a pay differential exists for working men and women in the United States. While the exact phrasing has sometimes made a difference in our ratings, weve generally rated Mostly True the claims that women earn 77 or 78 cents for every dollar a man does, while weve generally rated Mostly False the claims that said women earned 77 or 78 cents for every dollar a man earned for the same work. Thats because the 77 to 78 cent figure refers to earnings by men and women irrespective of the specific job held. The 77 to 78 cent statistic reflects that men and women tend to choose different professions and work different numbers of hours per week -- factors that may be noteworthy for policymakers, but which do not directly reflect wage discrimination on the part of employers for women and men who hold the same job. When you compare men and women who hold the same or similar jobs, the pay gap shrinks significantly, though it does not disappear entirely. Global comparisons The new wrinkle in Clintons comments is the international comparison. The study she referred to was released by the World Economic Forum, a Switzerland-based group that describes itself as committed to improving the state of the world through public-private cooperation. It is best known for its annual meeting of world economic and political leaders in Davos, Switzerland. The groups Global Gender Gap Report 2014 says it quantifies the magnitude of gender-based disparities and tracks their progress over time. The group explained that the gender gap index looks at the relative gaps between women and men across four key areas: health, education, economy and politics. The primary yardstick in the report ranked the United States 20th out of 142 countries. By contrast, the 65th place ranking comes from one of the subcategories. Specifically, that 65th-place ranking came from a survey in which executives were asked to rate on a numerical scale their answer to the question, In your country, for similar work, to what extent are wages for women equal to those of men? So Clinton engaged in a bit of cherry-picking. By focusing on the United States 65th-place ranking, rather than its 20th-place ranking, Clinton painted a much grimmer picture. In addition, the particular data point she used is based on a survey of several hundred business executives in the United States. That means its based heavily on perceptions of how much gender-based wage bias exists, not just on hard data showing actual wage differentials. Those executives perceptions may or may not be based on accurate assumptions. That said, Clinton does have some justification for citing the ranking she did. On the question of cherry-picking, it does appear that the 65th-place data point is the one most directly focused on gender-based wage discrimination; the other data points refer to elements that are less directly related, such as labor-force participation rates and overall compensation. And on whether its appropriate to use a survey rather than wage statistics, doing so does at least has the advantage of recording answers from executives in a wide range of countries across the globe. There does not appear to be comprehensive wage data for all or most countries by gender. The Clinton campaign expressed confidence in the value of the World Economic Forum survey and emphasized that it involved a larger number of countries. Hard data on the unexplained gender gap However, the more limited hard data that does exist puts the United States in a more favorable light on wage equity than Clintons talking point would suggest. That data comes from the International Labor Organization, a division of the United Nations. The groups Global Wage Report 2014/15 compared data from 29 developed countries, plus Europe as a whole. This data looks not just at gender-based wage gaps, but at how much of that gap can be explained by demographic factors unrelated to employer discrimination, such as education, experience and the divergent career choices made by men and women. Once you remove the explained portion of the wage gap, whats left -- the unexplained portion of the gender gap -- is considered a more direct approximation of how much discrimination is occurring against women when compared to men who hold the same job. And on this score, the United States rates well. Of the 30 nations studied, only Germany has a smaller unexplained wage gap than the United States does. By this measure, the United States outpaces such advanced industrialized rivals as the United Kingdom, France, the Scandinavian countries and Europe as a whole. Thats a much less dire picture than the one Clinton painted in her speech. Our ruling Clinton said the United States is 65th out of 142 nations and other territories on equal pay. She has cited a finding from one international survey of executives, but other data -- including actual wage data from more than two dozen advanced countries -- shows the United States second only to Germany in the lack of gender-based wage discrimination for men and women who hold the same job.",0.5,0.5,1,0.5,0,0.5,0.5,1,0.5,Half True

Final Rating: Half True",Ive never supported legislation that invades peoples choices about contraception.,"Republican gubernatorial candidate Ken Cuccinelli is combating accusations that hes tried to restrict the types of birth control Virginians could use. Ive never supported legislation that invades peoples choices about contraception, Cuccinelli told reporters on Aug. 27 while campaigning in Northern Virginia. His comment was reported by The Washington Post and The Loudoun Times. Cuccinelli made a similar comment during a July 20 debate with Democrat Terry McAuliffe when he was asked by moderator Judy Woodruff, Would you again seek to make several forms of contraception illegal as you did several years ago? Well, I certainly didnt do that several years ago, Cuccinelli replied. We examined Cuccinellis claim. At issue is his support of support of two personhood bills that sought to provide human embryos with legal rights. Both bills died in the General Assembly. Supporters say personhood laws provide a legal remedy to parents if an unborn child is killed by the negligent or criminal act of a third party. Opponents say the measures are a ruse to challenge abortion and contraception rights. In 2007, Cuccinelli as a state senator co-sponsored legislation that would have given pre-born humans the right to the enjoyment of life from the moment fertilization. Critics, including McAuliffe, say the bill would have outlawed birth control pills and other forms of contraception that prevent a fertilized egg from implanting in a uterus. As attorney general, Cuccinelli last year spoke at a rally for a similar bill that would have extended to human embryos and fetuses, from the moment of conception, all the rights available to others living in Virginia. Anna Nix, a spokeswoman for Cuccinellis campaign, said her bosss statements are accurate because the legislation he backed simply defined life and had no language or reference to any form of contraception or any access to contraception. Nix added in a follow-up email that Cuccinelli does not believe the government should regulate contraception and supported this legislation because he is pro-life, and this bill would protect innocent life. The debate on personhoods effect on contraception centers on how various forms of birth control work. No one disputes that condoms and other forms of birth control that merely prevent fertilization would unaffected by a measure to provide legal rights to preborn children. But various forms of FDA-approved contraception can also work to prevent the implantation of fertilized egg in the uterus. For example, although birth control pills mainly work to prevent fertilization by preventing the release of an egg, they can also make the lining of the uterus inhospitable to implantation after its fertilized, according to WebMD. Emergency contraceptives if taken soon after intercourse can prevent the release of an egg to prevent fertilization. But if taken later, they can prevent the implantation of an egg. Some abortion opponents believe life begins at the moment of fertilization and consider anything that prevents a fertilized egg from attaching to the uterus as tantamount to producing an abortion. Thats sparked concerns from supporters of contraceptive access that conveying rights to human eggs from the moment of fertilization could open the door to limiting birth control products that can prevent affect implantation. Nix, in her statement, did not spell out exactly how Cuccinelli defines contraception. We asked if he includes in his definition any method that prevents implantation of a fertilized egg, but didnt get a clear response. The pharmaceutical structure for contraception is one that changes with ongoing medical research, Nix said. Ken Cuccinelli is not interested in legislating contraception. We should note that as a state senator back in 2003, Cuccinelli voted against a Democratic measure that would have specified contraception does not constitute abortion. The bill, which passed the Senate but died in the House, defined contraception as methods that block fertilization or prevent implantation of a fertilized egg in the uterus. The American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists weighed in on that debate last year warning that personhood laws being considered around the nation saying it threatened certain forms of contraception. Although the individual wording in these proposed measures varies from state to state, they all attempt to give full legal rights to a fertilized egg by defining `personhood from the moment of fertilization before conception (ie. pregnancy/implantation) has occurred, ACOG wrote.  That would make condoms, spermicides and natural family planning the only legally allowed forms of birth control, the group said. In other words, the doctors said that only birth control devices that prevent sperm from joining an egg would remain legal. Thus, some of the most effective and reliable forms of contraception, such as oral contraceptives, intrauterine devices (IUDs) and other forms of FDA-approved hormonal contraceptives could be banned in states that adopt personhood measures, ACOG said. Three days after ACOGs statement, the Virginias 2012 personhood bill was approved by the Republican-led House on an almost straight party line vote. Democrats unsuccessfully offered an amendment that specified the legislation shall not be interpreted as affecting lawful contraception. Two days later -- on Feb. 15, 2012 -- Cuccinelli endorsed the bill at rally on the Capitol grounds, although news stories contain no mention addressing contraception in his speech. The bill, however, died in the Senate. Both the 2012 and the 2007 measures may not have survived legal challenge even if they had passed. A.E. Dick Howard, a University of Virginia constitutional law professor, pointed out to us that the U.S. Supreme Court in 1972 ruled that couples have a right of access to contraception. Our ruling Cuccinelli, in a carefully-worded statement, says hes never supported legislation that invades peoples choices about contraception. While hes never cast a vote on legislation that explicitly restricted birth control options, Cuccinellifor a decade has been one of the strongest anti-abortion voices in Virginia. Hes supported personhood bills that recognized life as beginning at the moment of conception or fertilization and bestowed human embryos with legal rights. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists says such legislation could outlaw birth control pills and other forms of contraception that prevent a fertilized egg from implanting in a uterus. Cuccinellis wording also allows him to gloss over a vote he cast in 2003 against legislation that would have specified contraception does not constitute an abortion. So Cuccinellis claim has some accuracy, but omits his consistent support of bills that would have opened or protected legal avenues to challenge the use of certain contraceptives.",0.5,0.6,1.0,0.4,0.0,0.5,0.5,1.0,0.5,Half True

Final Rating: Half True  ","The Legislature passed Gov. Walkers so-called property tax relief bill, but the Republicans are still raising your property taxes.","Soon it will be December and time for presents -- including your annual property tax bill. Oh, the suspense in opening the envelope: Will this years bill be lower or higher? But wait. On Oct. 24, 2013, Republican Gov. Scott Walker used his weekly radio address to herald a $100 million property tax relief bill he signed into law four days earlier. Relief means lower taxes, right? After we heard the opening lines of the Democratic response, put out the same day, we werent sure what to think. Last week, the Legislature passed Gov. Walkers so-called property tax relief bill, Ashland state Rep. Janet Bewley said in her address. Lost in all the hype is the fact that the governor and Republican-controlled Legislature are still raising your property taxes. So, is the property tax relief real? Is it somehow superseded by property tax increases? And dont school districts and other local governments help determine how big your property tax bill is? Property tax primer Well start by reviewing how a property tax bill comes to be. Every fall, each local unit of government -- cities, villages, towns, counties, school districts, and technical college districts -- adopts a budget for the following year. They subtract what they expect to receive in revenue, such as state aid, license fees, tuition, etc. The remainder has to come from property taxes, which happens to be the largest source of tax revenue in Wisconsin. In total, local governments levy more than 99% of all property taxes; the state claims the last sliver, for forestry programs. Nevertheless, state government plays an important role in how much your property tax bill turns out to be. First of all, the local governments levies get reduced by three state tax credits, including the state lottery credit. Second, the state has imposed a variety of caps on how much money local governments can raise or spend. So, even though the locals are the ones levying property taxes, the state puts strict limits on how much they can levy. For example, school districts are limited in the amount of money they can raise in total from property taxes and state aid. On the other hand, school districts can exceed their limits if voters approve a referendum. For municipalities and counties, their levy growth, if any, is limited to the amount of property taxes generated by new construction in their communities. The new law Reining in property taxes has been one of Walkers priorities as governor. On Oct. 10, 2013, citing growth in state tax revenue, he called a special session of the Legislature to take up property tax relief -- specifically by increasing state aid to school districts. So, the approach was not a simple across-the-board tax reduction. The property tax relief measure was approved overwhelmingly on bipartisan votes -- 82-12 in the Assembly, with Bewley among the Democrats voting for it, and 28-5 in the Senate. The law raises state aid payments to school districts by $40 million (0.92%) in 2013-14 and $60 million (1.36%) in 2014-15. But, as we discussed earlier, school districts are under revenue limits. So, while individual levies for school districts will vary, statewide the additional $100 million in state aid to school districts triggers a corresponding $100 million decrease in property taxes. State schools Superintendent Tony Evers pointed out that while the new law provides property tax relief for some school districts, it does not increase spending for public schools. Now, to Bewleys claim that Walker and the GOP-run Legislature are still raising your property taxes. The state budget In her radio remarks, Bewley argued that despite the property tax relief, the average persons property taxes will rise. When we asked for evidence, her office cited an October 2013 memo from the nonpartisan Legislative Fiscal Bureau. It takes into account not only the property tax relief, but also the 2013-15 state budget that Walker signed into law several months earlier. In contrast to the property tax relief bill, the state budget was adopted without a single Democratic vote. It passed 55-42 in the Assembly, with three Republicans voting no; then it passed 17-16 in the Senate, with one Republican voting no. According to the fiscal bureau, the property tax for a median-valued home -- $151,148 -- was $2,943. Under the biennial state budget, the tax was to drop by $5 in the first year, then increase by $36 in the second. That put the tax bill on the typical home at $2,974 -- a net increase of $31 over the two years. But with the property tax relief law, the tax on the typical home is now estimated to go down by $18 in the first year and increase $29 in the second. That would put the tax bill at $2,954 -- a net increase of $11. Walker spokesman Tom Evenson agreed with the figures, but noted that property tax increases have been held down under during Walker's first two years in office. He cited an August 2013 Wisconsin Taxpayers Alliance report that said total property taxes, not just the portion levied by school districts, rose by 0.2% in 2011-12 and 0.8% in 2012-13. That was the first time since at least 1946 that the total levy rose by less than 1% in two consecutive years, the report said. Our rating Bewley said the Legislature passed Gov. Walkers so-called property tax relief bill, but the Republicans are still raising your property taxes. Bewleys right that under the Republicans 2013-15 state budget, its estimated that property tax bills will rise, by an estimated $11 over two years for a typical home. But the increase would have been larger without the property tax relief, and property tax bills are affected by actions taken by local governments, not just the GOP-controlled state government. For a statement that is partially accurate but leaves out important details, we give Bewley a Half True.

Final Rating: Half True  ",Says shedebated her opponent multiple times.,"Charles Francis wants to stand on stage with Raleigh Mayor Nancy McFarlane and debate the best ways to address the citys issues. Francis on Sunday called for a runoff against McFarlane after the mayor, in municipal elections on Oct. 10, fell about 2 percentage points short of reaching the 50 percent required to secure the win. Francis, who trailed with 36 percent of the vote, says the two candidates have yet to debate. McFarlane, reacting to Francis announcement, on Monday challenged the idea that they havent debated. We debated multiple times, McFarlane said. Im not sure why he keeps bringing up this narrative that weve never debated. We had multiple forums. There were maybe five. How can one candidate say hes still waiting to debate while another says theyve debated multiple times? Because they appear to have different definitions of the word debate. Francis, an attorney, says McFarlane has declined his offer to stand on stage with him in a televised event where they argue the issues one-on-one. Debates are important so that voters can better see the clear alternative that they have in this race, he said in a statement. Mayor McFarlane has now tentatively agreed to a televised debate during the runoff election. I believe that this debate will point out the clear differences for voters to make an informed decision. McFarlane, a longtime pharmaceutical business owner, considers it a debate if the two candidates are in the same location at the same time explaining their political positions to voters. Her campaign notes that Francis has twice referred to events they attended as debates: in closing comments during the Aug. 15 Raleigh Wake Citizens Association forum; and on his Facebook page when he referred to a Sept. 28 forum as a debate. That may be true. But that doesnt necessarily mean either candidates definition of debate is accurate. Defining debate Merriam-Webster defines debate as a regulated discussion of a proposition between two matched sides and Dictionary.com says its a discussion, as of a public question in an assembly, involving opposing viewpoints. By those definitions, McFarlane certainly has a case. Both candidates have been in the same location at the same time answering the same questions. The Commission on Presidential Debates is a nonprofit group that has organized debates for presidential and vice presidential candidates in every general election since 1988. The commission doesnt offer a definition for a debate or list requirements to hold one. Instead, it offers a wide range of formats that can be used in debates and suggests that political debates should be structured and allow for rebuttals. The aforementioned descriptions are so vague that they dont necessarily help us in this situation. So we asked experts on political science, communication and forensics (which means debate) what they consider to be a true political debate. Key components They all suggested political debates include three elements: a stage, a large audience, and a format that allows for two candidates – and preferably no more – to engage each other in a way that allows for claims and rebuttals. The experts cast doubt on McFarlanes claim that forums qualify as debates. Forums where candidates answer the same questions could qualify as debates if the candidates are given time to engage each other, said David McLennan, professor of political science at Meredith College in Raleigh. But typically, they dont. Unless theyre addressing one another in the same venue, it wouldnt be a political debate, McLennan said. Allan Louden, chair of the communications department at Wake Forest University, researches argumentation theory, political communication and presidential rhetoric. Louden referred to forums not as debates but as joint appearances. He says debates are supposed to inform the public about key policy differences between candidates and that, by allowing candidates to challenge each other, face-to-face arguments are the best way to do that. He noted that the size of the audience matters. Debates are not much good if you dont have an audience. Robert Imbody, director of forensics at the University of Alabama, said he doesnt think any of the events qualify as a traditional political debate. He echoed McLennan and Louden in saying theres got to be crossfire. When we talk about what is a debate, were talking about an organized clash, Imbody said. If theres no clash or discord, then theres nothing to debate. Youre just giving speeches. So lets look at the events McFarlane and Francis attended together. McFarlanes campaign says she and Francis attended seven events together between Aug. 15 and Sept. 28. Three stood out to PolitiFact. Raleigh events On Aug. 15, McFarlane and Francis both attended the Raleigh Wake Citizens Association forum at Martin Street Baptist Church. James Sonneman, a spokesman for McFarlanes campaign, said the mayoral candidates were interviewed separately from council candidates. During the mayoral portion, only Francis and Nancy participated and were given ample room to engage in a discussion regarding questions posed by community members, Sonneman said. The event was not televised or streamed online. A recording provided by Sonneman includes audio of McFarlane and Francis answering the same questions, one at a time, and occasionally asking the moderator for a chance to respond to the other candidate. In closing comments, Francis said, I want to thank you all for your attention in the debate tonight. On Sept. 18, Sonneman says they attended a similar event: the Wake County Voter Education Coalition Forum at Garner Rd. Community Center. As I understand, it had a very similar agenda to the RWCA forum in that Mayoral and Council candidates went separately and that an engaging discussion between Nancy and Francis was fostered, he said. On Sept. 28, Francis and McFarlane attended a forum hosted by the League of Women Voters and WakeUP Wake County Forum at Avent Ferry United Methodist Church. The event, where mayoral and City Council candidates were asked the same questions, was streamed online at wral.com. The video shows McFarlane and Francis often taking turns answering the same question. In Mondays press conference, McFarlane pointed to the WakeUP event as a debate. Karen Rindge, executive director of WakeUP, said the format allowed for the candidates to engage each other. They could have raised a point about their opponent if they chose, Rindge said. However, I would not describe our candidate forum as a structured debate. Our ruling McFarlane said she has debated Francis multiple times. The candidates were indeed in the same place and exchanged ideas back-to-back. And Francis referred to a couple forums as debates. But political experts say most of the events shes referring to didnt include the key elements often needed for a fair, informative political debate.  ",0.5,0.5,1.0,0.5,0.0,0.5,0.5,1.0,0.5,Half True

Final Rating: Half True  ",The Trump administration has denied 4.2 million American workers overtime.,"As President Donald Trump praises his economic record while campaigning for re-election, Florida Democrats say that he hasnt done enough to help the middle class. The Trump administration has given corporations a $1 trillion tax cut — with almost nothing going into the pockets of workers — while at the same time, gutting workers rights, consumer protections, and denying 4.2 million American workers overtime, the Florida Democratic Party said in a press release, a day before Trumps Orlando rally. Its an exaggeration to say almost nothing is going into the pockets of workers, as our previous reporting shows. We wondered if the Trump administration denied 4.2 million American workers overtime. It turns out thats something of an exaggeration, too. Most employees are eligible for time-and-a-half overtime pay if they work more than 40 hours a week. But theres an exception for white-collar workers. To be considered a white-collar worker by the government, an employee has to make more than $455 per week, be paid a salary, and work in an administrative, executive or professional position. People who meet these criteria do not qualify for overtime pay. The Obama administration sought to boost the amount of money a white collar worker could earn and qualify for overtime. So in 2016, the Obama administration announced it would extend overtime eligibility to white collar salaried workers earning less than $913 a week, or $47,476 a year, about double the exemption level set in 2004 of $455 per week or $23,660 a year. The change would have extended eligibility to 4.2 million additional Americans, the Obama administration said. But a federal court in Texas halted the rule amid a challenge by Republican-led states and business trade groups. The Trump administration did not defend the Obama-era rule change, dropping the governments appeal in 2017. Instead, the Trump administration proposed its own rule; its number was more than the earlier exemption level but lower than the Obama rule. In March, the Labor Department proposed making workers eligible for overtime if they earn $679 per week, or $35,308 per year. Above this salary level, eligibility for overtime varies based on job duties. (The rule does not change overtime protections for various blue collar workers including police officers, firefighters, nurses and non-management employees in construction.) While the Obama rule would have automatically adjusted the salary threshold every three years, the Trump rule doesnt include that. The new Trump rule is expected to be finalized in 2020. The Democrats statement omits that the Trump administration wants to extend overtime to some Americans, though a much smaller number than Obamas rule intended to help 4.2 million in the first year. The Trump Labor Department estimates that its rule would provide overtime to around 1.3 million extra workers. Heidi Shierholz, who was the chief economist at Obamas Labor Department when the overtime rule was proposed and now works for the Economic Policy Institute, estimated that the Obama rule would have given new protections to 4.6 million workers in 2020 due to automatic updating. Daniel S. Hamermesh, a Barnard College economist, put the figure somewhat lower. He estimated that it would have led to about 3 million more people getting overtime. So the best conclusion is that the Trump regulation would leave unprotected about 2 million workers who would have been protected under the Obama regulation, he told PolitiFact. However, these are estimates, and its not possible to precisely know how many would have gotten overtime as a result of the Obama rule or the proposed Trump rule. Some factors are unknown, such as how employers would attempt to skirt the rules. We do know one thing, Hamermesh said. We know for sure the Trump partial rollback of the regulation will undoubtedly result in fewer people getting overtime pay than would have been the case under the Obama regulation, and the total amount of overtime paid to all people will also be less compared with the Obama rule. Rachel Greszler, a research fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation, said that there isnt a guarantee that all of those additional people would end up getting a higher paycheck under the Obama or Trump plan. Corporations could respond to changes in overtime thresholds by reducing base wages and other compensation, leaving workers total compensation the same. The Florida Democratic Party said the Trump administration has denied 4.2 million American workers overtime. In 2016, the Obama administration set a rule that would have raised the salary threshold for overtime pay, which it said would extend overtime to 4.2 million more workers. The Democrats omit that the Trump administration has proposed raising the salary threshold to extend overtime to about 1.3 million workers. Thats less than Obamas proposal, but not a denial to all 4.2 million workers.",0.5,0.5,1,0.5,0,0.5,0.5,1,0.5,Half True

Final Rating: Half True  ","Thanks to the Trans-Pacific Partnership, Vietnam is drafting and presenting unprecedented labor reforms, changing their Constitution to recognize worker organizations in Vietnam for the first time.","At a press conference with Singapores Prime Minister Lee Loong, President Barack Obama said the Trans-Pacific Partnership would improve global labor rights. Specifically, he said Vietnam had agreed to improve its labor policies as a condition of entering into the 12-country trade agreement, which has been contentious this election cycle. Vietnam is drafting and presenting unprecedented labor reforms, changing their Constitution to recognize worker organizations in Vietnam for the first time, Obama said. We fact-checked another TPP claim from the press conference, on tariffs, elsewhere. Here, we look at Obamas Vietnam claim. Labor law Before diving into what the TPP asks of Vietnam, lets look at what protections Vietnam already affords workers. The 2013 Vietnamese Constitution provides for break policies, equal and safe work conditions and protects against discrimination, forced labor and under-age workers. It also establishes trade unions to represent workers and protect their legal rights. According to a 2012 Law on Trade Unions, however, this is an entity placed under the leadership of the Communist Party of Vietnam. Essentially, all trade unions must affiliate with the Vietnam General Confederation of Labour. We consulted various law firms that cover Vietnamese labor law, and they detailed Vietnams already-existing labor protections. According to the the Southeast Asian law firm Tilleke & Gibbins, Vietnam sets a maximum of 48 hours per week and provides mandatory rest periods of at minimum 24 consecutive hours per week. Employers are required to provide protective equipment, and there is maternity leave typically around four months. The labor law firm Fisher Phillips classified Vietnams labor law as employee-friendly. We spoke to White House representatives who acknowledged Vietnam had such provisions. So, what then, was Obama referring to as unprecedented labor reforms? Work-in-progress The White House pointed us to a consistency plan negotiated as part of the TPP, titled the United States — Vietnam Plan for the Enhancement of Trade and Labour Relations. Key to the plan is the decoupling of labor unions from the government. Workers must be allowed to spontaneously form a grassroots labour union.The union must be registered, but not affiliated with, the government, thus allowing it to operate by its own rules and procedures. Vietnam shall ensure that its law does not mandate a labour union registered with the competent government body to operate according to the Statutes of Vietnam General Confederation of Labour, the plan states. Experts we spoke to said the term unprecedented is valid. The workers can form their own unions, said K. William Watson, a trade policy analyst at the libertarian Cato Institute. That's going to be a big change for Vietnam just because of the way it currently regulates labor unions. Its not going to be compatible with the TPP at all. John Sifton, Asia Advocacy director at Human Rights Watch, said independent unions are the first step to having workers enforce their own rights. This other stuff about minimum wage and working ours, all of that, is meaningless if you dont have unions, he said. Without unions, without the capacity to organize, whatever workers rights are written down on paper dont have teeth. Changes to labor laws are still going through the countrys legislative process, they said. While acknowledging that might be the case, Sifton said Obamas claim was premature for suggesting current changes. Theyve signed up to a whole lot of things and if President Obama had simply said, Vietnam has promised and must do a whole bunch of things under the TPP, then he would have been perfectly accurate, Sifton noted. But he made it sound like Vietnam has already started to do things and thats just not true. Enforcement Changing the law is one thing, but actually implementing it is another. Prior to the TPP entering into force, Vietnam must change its labor code to correspond with the side agreement, the White House explained. The plan also provides a review mechanism after-the-fact whereby the United States can impose higher tariffs on Vietnam if the provisions are not being implemented. Nonetheless, experts questioned both the likelihood of Vietnam implementing the new rules and of the United States enforcing them. Both Sifton and Watson noted Americas poor track record in enforcing other free trade agreements labor provisions. They have a terrible record of enforcing labor chapters as evidenced by the Central American Free Trade Agreement and the North American Free Trade Agreement and the Colombian Free Trade Agreement, Sifton said. So he says theyre enforceable and thats true on paper and its true technically, but it doesnt mean it would be be enforced. Watson, on the other hand, said it is in Vietnams economic interest — due to their significant gains from the TPP — to abide by the proposed legal changes. In order to attract investors, they have to follow the rules and wont be too antagonistic to the agreement, he explained. Its not a situation where this was something that they didnt want and now theyre going to try to sidestep it, he said. Vietnam is — economically — the country that will benefit the most from the TPP. Vague language in the consistency plan could also hinder implementation, said Angie Ngoc Tran, a professor at California State University. In an article in New Mandala, she criticized the deal for not offering enough protection for independent unions and other procedural issues. On the flip side,Cathleen Cimino-Isaacs at thePeterson Institute for International Economics, said the TPP has made progress to address past failures. ThePeterson Institute for International Economics has been described as a pro-trade economic policy group. Although the TPP does not address all the concerns of labor rights advocates, it represents an important step forward, Cimino-Isaacs wrote. The bilateral plans negotiated alongside the TPP are a major innovative component, targeted to address the substandard labor conditions of most concern. Implementation of the mandated reforms would deliver signiﬁcant improvements in Brunei, Malaysia, and Vietnam. The monitoring mechanisms attached to Vietnams plan in particular seem more proactive than past U.S. efforts. Our ruling Obama said Vietnam is drafting and presenting unprecedented labor reforms and is changing their constitution to recognize worker organizations in Vietnam for the first time. There are some problems with the claim. Experts said actual changes to the law have not happened yet but acknowledged the drafting process might be underway. They did agree, however, that the changes proposed would qualify as unprecedented. More critically, they said its hard to enforce the changes being described and the United States has a particularly poor track record of doing so. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/0b4621f6-693f-412e-9d5f-d66f11d089be (Update Aug. 5: This fact-check was updated to includeCimino-Isaacs' comments.)",0.5,0.5,1,0.5,0,0,0.5,0.5,0.5,Half True

Final Rating: Half True  ","I think if you look at the entire federal government and the presidents commitment to (fighting opioid addiction), youll see that there are actually hundreds of millions of dollars increase on this issue.","President Donald Trump has made a lot of promises to solve the countrys opioid crisis, which killed over 33,000 people in 2015 alone. They included the pledge to build a wall on the southern border to stop the flow of drugs from Mexico and Latin America and more money to accelerate new treatment and prevention programs. Secretary for the Department of Health and Human Services Tom Price and Counselor to the president Kellyanne Conway reiterated Trumps commitment to end the opioid crisis this month, as they visited New Hampshire - a state that has been one of the hardest hit by drug deaths. Their visit came a week after it was announced that the Trump administration had been planning to gut the Office of National Drug Control Policy, slashing the long-running agency's budget by $364 million, or about 95 percent, in its proposed budget. As it turned out, they did not go through with such a steep cut in Trumps final budget. Asked about the proposed cuts, Price said, I think if you look at the entire federal government and the presidents commitment to this challenge, youll see that there are actually hundreds of millions of dollars increase on this issue. But do Trumps proposals mesh with Prices statements about increasing money for treatment, prevention and recovery? Crunching the numbers To get some clarity, we reached out to the Department of Health and Human Services to get a numbers breakdown. A spokesman for HHS responded, pointing to funding in the Congressional omnibus bill, the temporary spending measure to keep the government running that was passed in early May. At minimum, the Omnibus provides $213 million in new funding to combat the opioid epidemic across the federal government, Alleigh Marre said. With all that in mind, the Secretarys comment that there is a hundreds of millions of dollars increase across the federal government, is true. However, that number includes money that was passed by Congress in 2016, before Trump was president, and doesnt account for the presidents proposed federal budget. Heres the breakdown of whats in that number: $500 million in 21st Century Cures Act grant money, which was passed by Congress under President Obama. $150 million as part of the 2017 omnibus, which includes money for the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, Centers for Disease Control and Health Resources and Services Administration to fight addiction. Marre also highlighted $12.5 million in funding for four new heroin enforcement groups within the DEA and $50 million to the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs to fund opioid and substance abuse prevention and treatment programs.  But since Price cited Trumps commitment to combat the opioid crisis, its important to note what money was approved before he took office. Budget and health care bill Beyond these budget increases, however, experts on addiction and recovery say that other proposals by Trump wont help ease the opioid crisis and could actually make it worse. His budget is asking for almost $400 million in cuts to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, which could result in fewer mental health block grants being distributed. And the recently proposed Republican health care bill, which Trump supports, proposes drastic cuts to Medicaid. The House bill calls for $800 billion of cuts to Medicaid in 10 years, on top of the $610 billion cut to Medicaid benefits sought in Trumps budget. That means Medicaid spending could be cut by 45 percent in 10 years. This has serious implications for people who get health insurance through expanded Medicaid in New Hampshire and elsewhere, many of whom get mental health treatment and substance abuse coverage paid. And that has many treatment advocates in New Hampshire worried. We need a system of response that includes access to treatment, recovery, and also, we have to address the supply side through supporting law enforcement in their work. Im not seeing evidence that thats actually happening, said Linda Saunders Paquette, director of treatment advocacy organization New Futures. Its worth noting that the presidents budget is just a blueprint; members of Congress have said they are unlikely to approve the spending plan as written. Our Ruling Citing Trumps commitment to fight the countrys opioid crisis, Price said the government is already spending hundreds of millions of dollars more to that end. More funding was approved in the recent Congressional omnibus bill to keep the government running, but other policies hes seeking to pursue -- notably cuts to Medicaid -- could wipe out that increase and then some.",0.5,0.5,1,0.5,0,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,Half True

Final Rating: Half True  ",In every other major industrial country in the world  inflation is higher.,"When President Joe Biden sat down for an interview with The Associated Press, it was inevitable that the nations 40-year-high levels of inflation would come up. During the interview, Biden said his policies are not to blame. Instead, he pointed to global conditions to show that the United States is not alone in facing such challenges as high oil prices, lagging supply chains during the pandemic, and disruptions from Russian President Vladimir Putins war in Ukraine. Biden said, First of all, (a recession is) not inevitable. Secondly, were in a stronger position than any nation in the world to overcome this inflation. Its bad. Isnt it kind of interesting? If its my fault, why is it the case in every other major industrial country in the world that inflation is higher? You ask yourself that? Im not being a wise guy. A reader noticed this statement and asked us to fact-check it. The statement can be read two ways. Is Biden (as the reader understood it) saying that every other major industrial country has a higher inflation rate than the U.S. does right now? Or is Biden saying that every other major industrial country has higher inflation than they normally do? The White House did not respond to an inquiry for this article. But well look at both interpretations. The accuracy of his statement depends on how his words are interpreted. If this is what Biden meant, he would be wrong. We turned to data collected by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, a group of advanced industrialized nations. Looking at the most recent monthly inflation numbers, more than a dozen OECD members had a higher inflation rate than the United States 8.6%. These were predominantly Baltic and Eastern European nations, which have been hit especially hard by the consequences of Putins invasion of Ukraine. But a larger number of OECD members had inflation rates lower than 8.6%, and these include all but one member of the G-7 group, which is limited to the worlds very largest democratic economies. Among the G-7 nations, Germanys most recent inflation rate was 7.9%, the United Kingdoms was 7.8%, Italys and Canadas were 6.8%, and Frances was 5.2%. (The final G-7 member, Japan, hasnt released current inflation numbers.) So the United States has a higher inflation rate currently than its closest economic peers do.  If this is what Biden meant, he would be right. In the six G-7 nations for which current inflation data is available — including the United States — pre-pandemic inflation rates hovered around 1% or 2%, rather than the 5% to 9% being seen now.  Some analysts would suggest that these two observations are consistent. They say that Bidens coronavirus relief bill — the American Rescue Plan, which passed shortly after he took office in 2021 — drove inflation higher in the United States than it did in the other countries, which had no equivalent fiscal stimulus of that scale that late in the pandemic. The Biden administration and its allies in Congress provided entirely too much stimulus into an economy that was already dealing with supply shortages, said Michael Faulkender, a finance professor at the University of Marylands Robert H. Smith School of Business. This is necessarily inflationary and was totally predictable. However, the U.S. may have benefited in other ways from its expansionary monetary and fiscal policy during the pandemic compared to other rich countries,Brookings Institution economist Gary Burtless said. The U.S. may have obtained some advantage from those expansionary policies in terms of faster real economic growth than its rivals, Burtless said. The downside, he added, is that these policies also seem to have produced the disadvantage of higher inflation. Biden said, In every other major industrial country in the world  inflation is higher. Hes right in one sense but wrong in another. Every other major industrialized nation has seen inflation spike well above pre-inflation levels. But the United States has seen its inflation rate spike higher than its most direct competitors.",0.5,0.5,1,0.5,0,0.5,0.5,1,0.5,Half True

Final Rating: Mostly False  ",Says Thom Tillis has cut $500 million from public education.,"Education spending was a point of contention in the North Carolina Senate debate on October 7, when Sen. Kay Hagan repeated a popular Democratic talking point that Thom Tillis and state House Republicans are responsible for cuts to school funding. Sen. Hagan said Tillis has cut $500 million from public education and, you know what that means folks? That means fewer teachers in the classroom. That means larger classroom sizes and that means outdated textbooks if theres any textbooks at all.  Back in June we checked the same claim from a television ad sponsored by Women Vote, an arm of EMILY's List, a political action committee that supports Democratic women who are in favor of abortion rights. Where did the cuts come from? When we looked at North Carolina's education budget year to year, it has increased every year since Tillis became speaker in 2011. According to a document prepared by the General Assembly, the state education budget was $10.8 billion in the 2010-11 fiscal year and $11.5 billion for 2014-15. (These numbers are adjusted for inflation and include both K-12 and higher education spending.) Additionally, state expenditure per pupil for K-12 has increased since 2011 -- from $5,156 in 2011 to $5,395 in 2013. Education spending in North Carolina comes from a combination of federal, state and local dollars. State funding accounts for more than 62 percent of expenditures. So did Sen. Hagan and Women Vote pull that $500 million cut out of thin air? No, but it's complicated. Each year, the North Carolina Office of State Budget and Management creates a continuation budget, which is a tool that outlines how much should be spent to maintain the current service level, without cutting or adding services. The projection might be larger or smaller than previous years because it takes into account factors such as inflation, population growth and operating new facilities. Lawmakers are not obliged to match the continuation budget. For the 2013-15 budget, the state budget office proposed a continuation budget of about $23.6 billion for those two years to maintain the status quo across K-12 and higher education. The budget that state lawmakers passed came up to about $23.1 billion. In total, lawmakers allocated $481 million less than the the continuation budget suggested. (EMILY's List pointed us to this when we asked about the ad back in June.) That shortfall ended up dividing the political parties in North Carolina: Last year, Tillis took to the floor to push lawmakers to pass the budget, while Democrats bashed the bill primarily because they believed the education allocations weren't adequate. The bill passed 65-53 in the House and 32-17 in the Senate, with no Democratic votes in favor. Its important to note that the Legislatures choosing to fund at levels lower than the continuation budget is not a literal budget cut. In raw dollars, the state is spending more money than in previous years. However, Tillis critics say it has the same effect as a cut. If youre not doing what it takes to maintain the status quo, its a cut, said Hagan spokeswoman Sadie Weiner. Some other critics of Tillis education record have noted that state funding for K-12 education in North Carolina is about $500 million less than pre-recession levels. In the 2013-14 school year, public school spending was about $7.9 billion. In 2008-2009, it was $8.4, when adjusted for inflation. The budget affecting the 2014-15 school year eliminated 5,200 teachers, 3,800 teacher assistants and about $115 million for textbooks and instructional supplies, among other services, Philip Price, CFO for the North Carolina Department of Public Instruction, told us in June. It also increases student-teacher ratios. The budget added a small number of new programs, but the vast majority of state education spending growth over the years comes down to rising healthcare and retirement costs. That doesnt help the students, Price said. It doesnt mean you get more teachers. It doesnt change what is available to that classroom. Reductions in federal and local education spending -- as well as funding shifts due to rising charter school popularity -- could also be a major reason why schools feel as if their funds have shrunk, despite a steadily increasing state budget, said Terry Stoops, director of research and education policy at the John Locke Foundation, a North Carolina think tank that promotes limited government. He added that between 2010 and 2013, federal funding to North Carolina schools dropped by $337.6 million. But when the federal government stopped giving North Carolina schools stimulus funding, the state did not pick up the slack, Price said. The state's shrinking spending on classroom services is part of a trend that has been going on since the recession -- back to when Democrats controlled the General Assembly -- and can't be solely blamed on one speaker of the house, he added. Our ruling Sen. Hagans statement attacking Tillis said he has cut $500 million from public education. Literally, the statement is wrong. As North Carolina's Speaker of the House, Tillis helped pass a budget in 2013 that increased actual spending on education in comparison to previous years. But the budget spent almost $500 million less than what was requested to maintain the status quo, accounting for inflation and increased costs of various services. Additionally, the actual budget increase had a lot to do with rising costs of employee benefits, and not a lot to do with money that ends up in the classroom.",0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,Mostly False

Final Rating: Half True  ","Thanks to our policies, for the first time in state history, we have put millions of dollars into our rainy day fund in consecutive years.","With a better-than-expected tax-collection estimate and savings from delaying some debt payments, Gov. Scott Walker on May 10, 2012 made a small deficit at the mid-point in his two-year budget -- poof -- disappear.Gone along with it: An issue Democrats were using against Walker in the June 5, 2012 recall election.This was posted the following day on the Walker campaign blog:Not only have we turned away from the failed policies that drove us to the brink of insolvency with chronic billion-dollar budget deficits, double-digit tax increases and record-setting job loss, but we have taken a complete 180 degree turn to true prosperity with a budget surplus that will help far into our future, the post read in part.The Walkers campaign boasted the news was so good extra funds will be socked away in budget-stabilization account: For the first time in state history, we have put millions of dollars into our rainy day fund in consecutive years.History, or course, can be an awful long time.Did back-to-back contributions happen thanks to Walkers policies?Wisconsin first created a stabilization fund in 1985, so its actually a fairly new thing. But the state has seldom put money into it. Thats one reason Wisconsin lives closer to the fiscal edge than many other states.According to the Legislative Fiscal Bureau, the first deposit into the fund was in 2006-07, during the final term of Democratic Gov. Jim Doyle, Walkers predecessor.That deposit totalled $55.6 million, but was quickly used up in a budget crisis later in Doyles term.The second deposit made to the fund -- $14.8 million -- came at the end of Doyles last budget, 2010-11. The deposit was made after Walker had taken office. His first six months overlapped the final six months of the Doyle budget.That brings us to May 2012.Thats when Walker signalled that he could make another deposit, estimated at $45.4 million, after the fiscal year ends June 30, 2012.So, did Walker -- for the first time in state history put millions of dollars into our rainy day fund in consecutive years?Not exactly.First, the deposit is a projection. It would make two budgets in a row for the first time if it happens. It looks likely that a deposit will be made, but its premature to say it already happened.Second, the numbers are not based on the official revenue estimates that come from the Fiscal Bureau, the neutral scorekeeper on budget items. That caused Democrats to howl in protest when Walker put out the well-timed news.In February 2012, the Fiscal Bureau said that tax revenues were coming up short, leaving a small projected deficit by June 2013.The new Walker estimate is based on revenue forecasts compiled by Walkers Department of Administration for February, March and April. In a May memo to Walker, Administration Secretary Mike Huebsch described it as the potential for a $45.4 million deposit when the books close at the end of June 2012.While not official, the estimates are based on the same sources of data used by the Fiscal Bureau. Bureau Director Bob Lang told us he didnt verify Walkers numbers but said they dont appear unreasonable.Well know the size of the actual deposit, if there is one, when the state completes its annual financial report once accounts are settled, in late summer. Its also possible the deposit could exceed the projected $45.4 million.Who deserves credit?While 2011 was Doyles final budget year, it was Walker who brought the budget back into balance with his budget-repair bill in early 2011.You may recall that little old bill -- the one that included higher pension and health-insurance payments from state and local government employees, and curtailed collective bargaining for most public employees.Likewise, the expected 2012 surplus would clearly be on Walkers watch.But its arguable how much a governor has to do with rising tax collections. Walkers administration attributed the brighter tax-collection forecasts in large part to improved job-creation figures and personal income growth, which are subject to economic cycles. Additionally, putting money in the stabilization fund is not a matter of choice. By law, 50 percent of any surplus from higher-than-expected income and other tax collections must be transferred to the rainy day fund. Thats exactly what Walker is saying he would deposit.I believe that both the Doyle deposit and pending Walker deposit were not done by volition or predetermined plan but by a state law requirement when excess funds appear, said Todd Berry, president of the Wisconsin Taxpayers Alliance.But we attribute budget deficits to elected officials, so they must also get some credit for surpluses.Our ratingWalkers took credit for what the campaign said was a historic double-up of surplus tax funds into a rainy day fund for stabilizing future state budgets. The chances for a second straight transfer into the fund appear good, but its premature to say the money is in the bank.Walker gets the bulk of the credit, but his campaign claim is just partially accurate, because it skips over the important fact that the deals not done yet.

Final Rating: Half True  ","Three of the 11 most violent cities in the U.S. are in Missouri — St. Louis, Kansas City, and Springfield.","The FBI releases its Uniform Crime Report every year. And every year politicians, news outlets and pundits use it to rank cities by their rate of violence, despite FBI cautions against doing so. This year was no different. In his first State of the State address, Missouri Republican Gov. Eric Greitens used the data to make a point: The state has a crime problem. Three of the 11 most violent cities in the U.S. are in Missouri — St. Louis, Kansas City and Springfield, Greitens said. And its not just in the cities. When you talk to sheriffs, chiefs of police and front line officers around the state, theyll tell you its getting harder to do police work. We wondered if the statistic was true. Were Missouris three largest cities also some of the most violent in the country? The limits of comparing cities Taken at face value, the crime reporting data paints a bleak picture of crime in the state. If you were to compare the rate of violent crime for U.S. cities with a population of at least 100,000, Greitens would appear to be on target. In 2015, the most recent year with available data, St. Louis was in first place with a crime rate of 1,817 per 100,000. Kansas City came in 10th place (1,417 per 100,000) and Springfield in 11th (1,355 per 100,000). However, according to Richard Rosenfeld, a criminology professor at University of Missouri-St. Louis, rankings should be taken with a grain of salt. Crime statistics are simply not accurate enough to, for example, meaningfully distinguish city number five from city number six or seven in a ranking of city crime rates, Rosenfeld said. But they can be used to compare the crime rates in cities of similar size and demographics. Lets take, for instance, the 50 largest cities in the country. Detroit, with a population of 673,225, had the highest rate of violent crime, at 1,759 per 100,000. Kansas City fell in 6th place. But St. Louis isnt even included on that list. The city, which does not include the smaller, suburban cities around the downtown area, is the 57th largest city with a population of 317,095. And Springfield, with a population of 166,860, isnt anywhere near as large as Kansas City (473,373). Why does this matter? One reason is that any increase in crime has a larger effect on smaller populations than it does on more populous areas. An increase of 200 more violent crimes in Springfield would bump the city up three places on the list. The same hypothetical increase for Kansas City bumps it up one place. Over the last few years, Kansas City and St. Louis have remained around the same spot on the rankings, give or take two or three ranks. Springfield, however, was in the 27th spot in 2012. To Greitens credit, if you were to compare these cities to other cities with about the same population, the three have higher than average crime. St. Louis crime rate was 2.5 times the average rate of violent crime for cities with a population of 250,00 or more. Kansas Citys was a little under twice the average rate. Springfield has surprisingly high crime rates, Rosenfeld said. Compared to the average rate of violent crime for cities with between 100,000 and 250,000 people, Springfield had almost three times as much violent crime. Rosenfeld said much of that has to do with poverty. When you see high levels of poverty, you tend to see high levels of crime, he said. Almost 55 percent of kids in the Springfield R-12 school district qualify for free or reduced-price lunches, a measure of poverty, according to data from the Missouri Department of Education. Because factors like crime and other underlying characteristics vary from city to city, even the FBI says its unfair to rank them on a single variable like crime. Data users should not rank locales because there are many factors that cause the nature and type of crime to vary from place to place, reads an FBI disclaimer. UCR statistics include only jurisdictional population figures along with reported crime, clearance, or arrest data. Rankings ignore the uniqueness of each locale. The disclaimer lists several dozen different factors, including economic conditions, citizens crime reporting practices and population density. Cities are considerably different from another based on things like demographics, tourism, commutes, said James Alan Fox, a criminology professor at Northeastern University. Where does the city end? Because crime doesnt respect political boundaries, presenting data from a crime-infested area as an exact reflection of an entire city can be misleading. The FBI estimated the St. Louis metro-area population at 2.8 million in 2015, and Kansas Citys was a little more than 2 million. Yet the populations considered in the crime reporting data were 317,000 for St. Louis and 473,000 for Kansas City. One of the problems is the extent to which nonresidents spend time in the citys center, Fox said. Suburbs have a moderating effect on the data, so crime rate can depend on how many suburbs are included in the citys jurisdiction. For St. Louis, that appears to be the case. Sam Dotson, the police chief of the St. Louis Metro Police Department, said the Uniform Crime Reporting statistics are absolutely not reflective of crime in the region. Unlike almost every major metropolitan area in the country, St. Louis city is independent from its county. In 1877, the two split after a contentious and narrow vote among county residents and city voters, many of whom were tired of the extra tax burden from the county. When St. Louis city made a decision to separate itself, it was political, Dotson said. Were living with the repercussions today. The county crime data has an equalizing effect. If you were to combine the county with the city, St. Louis crime rate would fall to around 44 on the list, Dotson said. He did not deny that the city has a crime problem, which he said has everything to do with the citys level of poverty. We have crime, Dotson said. We have too much crime. So does everywhere else. To single us out is wrong. Dotson also disagreed with Greitens comments blaming crime on the ability of police departments to perform their job. Policing has a piece and responsibility, he said. But police officers cant fix school systems. Police officers cant fix the economy. If you want to reduce crime in Kansas City, St. Louis and Springfield, you have to address those issues too. Our ruling Greitens said, Three of the 11 most violent cities in the U.S. are in Missouri — St. Louis, Kansas City and Springfield. Greitens is basing his comments on high-quality data, but he uses the data in ways that experts recommend against. Experts dispute the reliability of ranking one city against others based on crime rates. Even the FBI, which compiles the statistics, has a policy against the practice. Greitens statement is partially accurate but takes things out of context.",0.5,0.5,1,0.5,0,0.5,0.5,1,0.5,Half True

Final Rating: Half True  ",Says 282 Texas school districts have requested emergency waivers to increase elementary school class sizes because of unprecedented fiscal challenges.,"In a Jan. 9, 2012, press release, U.S. Rep. Silvestre Reyes, D-El Paso, urged Republican Gov. Rick Perry to convene a special legislative session so lawmakers can provide more money to under-served schools. Citing the Legislature's 2011 decision to give school districts $4 billion less through August 2013 than they would have gotten under previous funding formulas, Reyes said: Our school districts are now experiencing unprecedented fiscal challenges and being forced to take drastic measures, like increasing class sizes and cutting instructional supports. In fact, the Texas Education Agency is reporting that 282 school districts have requested emergency waivers to increase class sizes. That would be nearly a third of the state's 1,000-plus districts. Is the congressman right? His statistic checks out, we found, but it's unlikely that all the requests were driven by financial difficulties. Texas has capped the size of classes in kindergarten through fourth grade since 1984, when the Legislature passed a measure setting the limit at 22 students per teacher. The thinking at the time was that smaller classes would result in greater student achievement. But the caps had an out. Currently, a school district may receive a waiver if the state education commissioner finds the limit works an undue hardship on the district. In an interview, Texas Education Agency spokeswoman Debbie Ratcliffe told us that state education officials originally set two scenarios under which waivers would be granted: if a district were unable to hire enough teachers or lacked the classroom space to meet the 22:1 ratio. Later, she said, the agency added an additional factor — if a district had experienced unanticipated enrollment growth. From fall 1993 through spring 2010, the number of districts granted class-size waivers generally fluctuated between 90 and 150 each semester, according to information in two reports from the education agency. Ratcliffe told us that over the years, the agency approved virtually every waiver (request) that was submitted. To support Reyes' claim that the number of Texas school districts seeking waivers rocketed to 282 this school year, his office sent us a Jan. 3, 2012, El Paso Times article containing figures attributed to the state. As of Dec. 21, 2011, the article says, 282 districts had requested waivers for 1,643 campuses and 8,186 classrooms. When requesting a waiver, a district must designate how many classes at each campus will exceed the cap. Ratcliffe, confirming the 282 figure, told us that of those requests, 266 were granted outright while 16 districts were given partial approval, meaning some campuses could exceed the limit while others could not. The education agency generally rejected waivers for campuses rated academically unacceptable under the state's education accountability rating system, Ratcliffe said. As of Jan. 10, 2012, a total of 286 districts had sought class-size waivers. Of those, 270 — including the Austin, Del Valle, Eanes, Hays, Lake Travis, Leander, Manor, Pflugerville and Round Rock districts — had been granted waivers outright. That's an all-time high, Ratcliffe said. For comparison, she said, there were 168 waivers granted to districts in the 2010-11 school year. So, as of early 2012, district class-size waivers had increased 61 percent since the previous school year. Whats going on? Even before the 2011 legislative session began in January, state funding for education was expected to be stressed because of lawmakers' vow to balance the 2012-13 state budget without raising taxes. In addition to the $4 billion drop in formula-based funding to districts, lawmakers also did not renew about $1.3 billion in grant funding for education programs. Some districts had local funding problems as well, Ratcliffe said, as declining property values reduced property tax revenue. To help districts deal with the budget-tightening, lawmakers considered softening the 22-to-1 class-size cap. They did not agree on any change, but in the fall, Education Commissioner Robert Scott made it easier for districts to exceed the limit by adding financial hardship as a fourth reason districts could qualify for a waiver. Ratcliffe told us that this school year is unusual because some districts had enough classroom space to adhere to the class-size rule and had access to qualified teacher candidates, but still lacked the funds to hire them. Ratcliffe speculated that districts' financial difficulties are what led to the big uptick in waiver requests this school year. Another likely factor, she said, is that some districts built their budgets assuming that lawmakers would loosen the class-size cap — and when that didn't happen, they were too far along in budgeting for the year to adjust. We asked the education agency whether all the districts that had requested waivers as of early 2012 had cited financial hardship in their applications. Ratcliffe said the agency had not crunched the data that way. On Jan. 19, 2012, we looked at the data ourselves after generating a report on this school years waivers from the education agencys website. The report had 2,911 entries, one for each grade level of each school that would be affected by a waiver. For example, if a district received a waiver for kindergarten and fourth grade at one elementary school, there would be two entries in the report for that campus. Our overview: ** At least 163 school districts that had received waivers cited financial hardship as the reason for seeking the exception for at least one campus. That's 60 percent of the total number of districts that had received waivers as of early January. ** Some districts that requested waivers hadn't cited financial hardship as a reason, including Houston, the state's largest school district, which had received waivers for 441 grade levels over 146 campuses, and Austin, which had received waivers for 18 grade levels in 16 elementary schools. ** Some districts exclusively cited the financial hardship reason in their requests, including Dallas, which had received exceptions for 45 grade levels on 34 campuses, and Bexar County's Northside, which had received waivers for 150 grade levels on 63 campuses. Our ruling Reyes accurately recaps how many districts had requested class-size waivers from the state education agency as of late December 2011 — a number that subsequently grew. Yet, his suggestion that financial difficulties born from the 2011 Legislatures actions are responsible for all of the waiver requests is an overstatement, considering that historically, dozens of districts have sought and received waivers each year. Then again, 60 percent of districts that had received a waiver as of early January cited the new financial hardship reason when seeking permission to exceed the class-size law.",0.8,0.6,1.0,0.7,0.4,0.5,0.5,0.9,0.6,Half True

Final Rating: Half True  ","Donald Trump's strategy is pretty simple. They have even said in his campaign it's to get women to stay home, get young people to stay home, get people of color to stay home, and get a lot smart, intelligent men to stay home, too.","With a little more than a week until Election Day, Hillary Clinton attacked what she called Donald Trumps strategy to keep groups of people away from the polls come Nov. 8. Donald Trump's strategy is real simple, Clinton told a crowd Oct. 29 in Daytona Beach, Fla. They have even said in his campaign it's to get women to stay home, get young people to stay home, get people of color to stay home, and get a lot of smart, intelligent men to stay home, too. Has Trumps campaign really said that? It turns out Clinton is referring to news articles that quote anonymous Trump advisers who say the campaign's strategy is to keep Clinton supporters home on Election Day by ratcheting up her negatives. Suppression? More like voter depression Clintons campaign pointed to news reports that quote anonymous Trump officials. The first example is a Bloomberg Businessweek article from Oct. 27 that takes readers behind the scenes of Trumps marketing operations. The article quotes a senior Trump campaign official saying that the campaign has three major voter suppression operations under way. The article doesnt offer any more details about the source other than the fact the person was a senior official. According to the Bloomberg story, the suppression operations are targeting white liberals, young women and African Americans through radio spots, social media and targeting specific neighborhoods. What specifically is Trump telling those groups? Clintons 1996 remark where she suggests some African-American males are super predators is being used in social media posts aimed at discouraging African-Americans from voting. The group of women who say they were sexually assaulted by Bill Clinton and degraded by Hillary Clinton are meant to dismantle young womens positive views of Clinton and so on. This isnt the only article that quotes an unidentified Trump adviser making a similar claim. Trumps advisers told the Wall Street Journal the campaign is trying to depress Democratic voter turnout. After news broke of Trumps 2005 lewd comments about sexual assault and women, the Trump campaign implemented a scorched earth strategy to keep voters home on Nov. 8, the Wall Street Journal reported. Just like what was reported in the Bloomberg article, Trump advisers told the Wall Street Journal that Trump was looking to use the attacks over Clintons email server and allegations about her husband to keep Clinton supporters home on election day. Theres also a Yahoo News article with a similar story from another unidentified source. Caveats There are caveats that come with Clintons claim. First, we cant independently verify if Trump officials said these things. Trump, himself, has said not to trust articles that dont name specific sources. Remember, don't believe sources said by the VERY dishonest media. If they don't name the sources, the sources don't exist. Also, publicly, Trump has gone to great lengths to court women and African-American voters. He has called for six weeks of mandatory paid maternity leave and tax credits for child care. And he has tried to attract African-Americans by touting his business plan, saying the Clinton and Democrats have failed. What the hell do you have to lose? said Trump, asking for black voters' support. Further, experts say what the media reports are describing are not all that shocking or atypical. In some ways, Clinton is describing modern-day politics warts and all. Tobe Berkovitz, an associate professor of advertising at Boston University, who has worked as a political media consultant for presidential campaigns, said its likely that Trumps campaign is trying to curb Clinton voters with negative campaigning. He said this is not unusual because modern politics based in negativity is an inherent part of campaigns, adding that negative campaigning discourages the hell out of all voters. If you look at Trumps strategy as negative campaigning, then it seems that Trump is not trying to suppress voters, but depress them. Our ruling Clinton said, Donald Trump's strategy is pretty simple. They have even said in his campaign it's to get women to stay home, get young people to stay home, get people of color to stay home, and get a lot get a lot of smart, intelligent men to stay home, too. Thats leaving a lot of details out. Trump never literally told women, young people, people of color and intelligent men, to stay home on Nov. 8. Clintons remark refers to news articles that quote anonymous sources from the campaign saying the strategy is to reduce turnout for Clinton by targeting specific groups of people, including young people, women and people of color. Yet Trump himself has tried to woo women and African-Americans on the campaign trail and said anonymous-sourced stories from his campaign should not be trusted. Lastly, experts say what Clinton is describing is a fairly typical type of negative campaigning. Clintons statement is partially accurate.",0.5,0.5,1,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,1,0.5,Half True

Final Rating: Half True  ",Says Donald Trump wants to kick thousands of kids off of BadgerCare.,"Addressing the Wisconsin Democratic Partys annual convention, U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin laid into Republicans, particularly President Donald Trump. You know, I remember Donald Trump coming to Wisconsin during the campaign and saying the same things Republicans always say here: Im on the side of the little guy, Im for working families, Ill fight for you, the Baldwin said on June 2, 2017. But it was another scam. Baldwin, a Democrat who faces re-election in 2018, then criticized several proposals backed by Trump, including the GOP replacement plan for Obamacare. He wants to kick thousands of kids off of BadgerCare, Baldwin charged, echoing comments she made a few days earlier on MSNBC. Who would cut health care for children? Lets see if shes right. What is BadgerCare? BadgerCare (also known as BadgerCare Plus) provides health insurance coverage to low-income Wisconsin residents, including pregnant women, childless adults and children. It is funded through Medicaid. The latest enrollment numbers, from May 2017, show 790,189 residents enrolled, including 412,208 children. Several days after Baldwins speech, GOP Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker proposed changes in the program for able-bodied adults, saying he wants to move them from government dependence to true independence, partly through drug testing. If the federal government gives Walker permission, Wisconsin would become the first state to do such drug testing. Under the plan, those who fail and refuse substance abuse treatment would have their coverage rejected. Baldwins evidence To back Baldwins attack on Trump, her campaign cited estimates made in May 2017 by two left-leaning research groups. The Wisconsin Budget Project, a program of the nonprofit Wisconsin Council on Children and Families, said in a blog post that a group of about 5,000 children in Wisconsin is particularly at risk of losing their eligibility for BadgerCare as a result of funding reductions to the Childrens Health Insurance Program that would be made under Trumps 2018 budget proposal. Jon Peacock, the groups research director, told us that while the budget would not dictate that children be removed from BadgerCare, Wisconsin would have to make up for the funding reductions in order to keep those children on BadgerCare. He said a total of 80,000 children would be put at risk of losing BadgerCare. The Washington, D.C.-based Center for American Progress made a longer-term estimate, saying 53,600 children would lose BadgerCare in 2026 because of Medicaid funding reductions proposed by the GOPs replacement for Obamacare that has been approved by the U.S. House of Representatives. That figure was based on estimates done by David Cutler, a professor of applied economics at Harvard University who was a campaign adviser to Barack Obama; and Emily Gee, a health economist at the center who formerly worked at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. Other evidence A spokeswoman for the Wisconsin Department of Health Services, which administers BadgerCare, said the department has not done a full analysis of Trumps budget or the GOP health plan, but told us the state is committed to ensuring that everyone living in poverty has access to affordable health insurance. The two estimates, however, include people with family incomes above the federal poverty level. So, they would not be covered by such a commitment from the Walker administration. Zach Hunter, a spokesman for a House committee that wrote much of the GOP replacement bill, said the bill contains tax credits that would provide families up to $14,000 a year to purchase insurance. He also said the Center for American Progress estimate is based on projections made by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, which he said has repeatedly struggled to estimate coverage impacts with accuracy when it comes to Obamacare. Our rating Baldwin says Trump wants to kick thousands of kids off of BadgerCare. The presidents budget proposal and the GOP replacement for Obamacare, which he supports, dont dictate that children lose their BadgerCare health insurance. But both would make cuts to federal spending that two left-leaning research groups say would threaten the BadgerCare eligibility of thousands of children.",0.5,0.5,1.0,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,1.0,0.5,Half True

Final Rating: Mostly True  ","Says NRA head Wayne LaPierre said, We believe in absolutely gun-free, zero-tolerance, totally safe schools. That means no guns in Americas schools. Period.","Just about a week after the deadly shooting at a Florida high school, the National Rifle Associations vice president Wayne LaPierre delivered the groups response: more armed guards in schools. Our banks, our airports, our NBA games, our NFL games, our office buildings, our movie stars, our politicians — they are all more protected than our children at school, Lapierre said at the Conservative Political Action Committee Feb. 22. To stop a bad guy with a gun, it takes a good guy with a gun. LaPierre had barely stepped down from the stage when the advocacy group Everytown for Gun Safety tweeted this blast from LaPierres past. #tbt to Wayne LaPierre in 1999. #CPAC pic.twitter.com/oVfq3VR9zs The group quoted LaPierre as saying in 1999, We believe in absolutely gun-free, zero-tolerance, totally safe schools.That means no guns in Americas schools. Period. There are a few angles to consider here. Did LaPierre say those words? Yes, he did. It was May 1, 1999, 10 days after two teenage boys killed 13 people, wounded more than 20 others and then committed suicide at Columbine High School in Colorado. LaPierre spoke at the NRAs annual convention and called for a policy banning guns from school. But LaPierre said more than what the Everytown group quoted. He was talking about guns brought to school by students, not teachers or trained security. Of the 6,000 young people the president acknowledges were caught with a gun at school during the past two years, we believe all of them should have been prosecuted, LaPierre said. But the truth is only five were prosecuted in 1997. And just eight were prosecuted in 1988. That's not zero tolerance. LaPierre made a passing reference to armed guards in schools, referring to the rare exception of law enforcement officers or trained security personnel. As for arming teachers, something President Donald Trump has shown a keen interest in, LaPierre said nothing. In his 1999 speech, his emphasis was on what adults should do to keep weapons out of the hands of teens. LaPierre said the NRA held adults responsible. Just as every kid should have a guardian who knows where he is and keeps him safe, every firearm should have a guardian who knows where it is and keeps it safely stored, LaPierre said. Columbine horrified the nation in its scale and the cold-blooded method of the high school seniors who had spent a year planning their attack. The Senate passed a bill to strengthen background checks, but it died in the House. The slaughter prompted more discussion of early identification of loners, and more emphasis on school security. Keeping weapons out of the hands of minors gained more attention. The 2012 shootings in Newtown, Conn., that took the lives of 26 elementary students and one of their teachers was the signature event when LaPierre spoke forcefully about a good guy with a gun being the best response to a bad guy with a gun. His rhetoric in 2012 was the same as when he spoke in 2018. American airports, office buildings, power plants, courthouses, even sports stadiums are all protected by armed security, LaPierre said at a news conference Dec. 21, 2012. Yet, when it comes to our most beloved, innocent, and vulnerable members of the American family, our children, we as a society leave them every day utterly defenseless. In 2012, LaPierre called on Congress to immediately appropriate whatever is necessary to put armed police officers in every single school in this nation. Everytown for Gun Safety tweeted the reminder that nearly two decades ago, LaPierre said, We believe in absolutely gun-free, zero-tolerance, totally safe schools. That means no guns in Americas schools. Period. The quotation is accurate, but it takes LaPierres words out of context. His full message was that adults should keep weapons out of the hands of minors and that schools and localities should act swiftly to punish any student caught bringing a firearm to school. In 1999, LaPierre also left open the door for armed security on school grounds, but that was not the focus of the policy debate at the time. That option has since risen on the NRAs agenda. The Everytown tweet has a measure of truth, but it leaves out important context that changes the meaning behind LaPierres words.",1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,Mostly True

Final Rating: Mostly False  ",Since I came into office  we have increased the VA budget by 85 percent.,"During a CNN town hall on Sept. 28, 2016, President Barack Obama took an emotional question from Donna Coates, the widow of Army veteran Barry Coates, who died of cancer after being misdiagnosed at a VA hospital. My mama's always told me that if you stop talking about stuff and do it, then you don't have to talk about it any longer, Coates said. So when are we going to actually start holding these contracted doctors and the VA employees accountable? Obama expressed his sympathies and said, I don't want to in any way pretend that we're where we need to be. Still, he said, progress has been made in such areas as replacing outdated patient-intake systems. We now have a situation where about 80 percent of individuals who interact with the VA are satisfied that they're getting timely treatment, he said. I want that to be 100 percent. And that requires more work. Obama went on to say that since I came into office, just to give you some sense of perspective, we have increased the VA budget by 85 percent. Even over an eight-year presidential tenure, that sounded like a pretty big increase to us. So we decided to see if it was accurate. Mandatory vs. discretionary spending We turned to VA budget data to see how large the increases have been. This chart summarizes what we found: This chart shows that VA spending has certainly increased since 2008. But we've broken it down intotwo colors because its important to distinguish between two types of funding. The blue portion, known as discretionary spending, is funding that needs to be passed by Congress and signed by the president every year. The red portion, known as mandatory spending, includes funds allocated based on eligibility rules established long before the year when theyre allocated. Examples of mandatory funds include payouts for disability claims, burials, pensions and education. The White House confirmed that the 85 percent increase refers to the entire VA budget, including mandatory and discretionary spending. They said that the Obama administration did have an impact on the mandatory spending figure by enacting increased access to benefits, including expandingeligibility for benefits related to Agent Orange exposure. Still, a large reason for the growth in mandatory spending is that the United States has been engaged in fighting wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, thus creating more and more veterans who qualify for mandatory benefits. So, to a great extent,mandatory spending is on autopilot when a president takes office, meaning thatits not obvious that Obama can take significant credit for increasing the mandatory portion of the spending bump on hiswatch. The size of the increases Its also worth noting that when Obama uses the 85 percent growth figure, hes choosing the largest of several figures he could have used. There are so many choices because comparing budget growth in the way Obama did is more complicated than it seems at first glance. For starters, fiscal years -- the October-to-October time frames that are typically used in federal budgeting -- do not line up neatly with presidential terms, which always begin on January 20. So one could make an argument that the best base year to use in Obamas comparison could be either fiscal year 2008 or fiscal year 2009. And the end years are tricky, too. The most recent year for which final, solid dollar figures are available is 2015. For 2016, we only have projections. We ran the numbers for each of the four possible time spans and found that the increase in overall spending ranged from 67 percent at the low end to 86 percent on the high end. So Obamas 85 percent figure is cherry-picked, although even the worst calculation for Obama shows a 67 percent increase, which is still pretty substantial. Remember, however, that the president has the most influence -- along with Congress, with whom Obama had to agree -- on the discretionary portion of the VA budget. And the increases in discretionary spending were smaller. For discretionary spending only, the same four possible calculations produce anything from a 36 percent increase to a 61 percent increase. That's a less impressive sounding claim -- at the low end, its an increase of roughly 4 percent a year, rather than 10 percent a year, as Obamas original statement would suggest. That said, Stan Collender, a budget specialist and executive vice president of the firm Qorvis MSLGROUP, cautioned that even an increase of 4 percent a year is nothing to sneeze at these days in federal budget land. I doubt many other parts of the discretionary budget had increases of that size, or at all. Our ruling Obama said, Since I came into office  we have increased the VA budget by 85 percent. Obama has a point that the VA has seen significant percentage increases during his tenure, particularly for a period of budgetary belt-tightening elsewhere. However, its a stretch for him to take credit for that, since so much of the increase stemmed from mandatory spending that originated witha continuing stream of veterans returning home and qualifying for benefits. Obama hasalso cherry-picked the highest numerical figure he could have. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/31e464bc-18c7-4796-aadf-5c9cb65de6c7",0.7,0.5,1.0,0.6,0.0,0.5,0.4,0.7,0.5,Mostly False

Final Rating: Half True  ",What is the maximum number of students allowed in your classroom? ... 30 or more!,"A battle has erupted among parents, educators, taxpayers and politicians about how many students should be allowed in Florida classrooms.That battle will be waged on the Nov. 2, 2010, ballot when voters statewide will decide on Amendment 8, which would change the rules about class sizes that voters approved in 2002. Groups urging Floridians to vote yes or no have created catchy websites and mailers with photos of eager students, stern-looking teachers in crisp white button-down shirts and claims about what will happen to children's futures.In a related Truth-O-Meter, we examined a claim from a group pushing for passage of Amendment 8 about the number of empty classroom seats statewide. In this Truth-O-Meter, we will examine a claim by the groupopposingpassage of the amendment.In a mailer we saw Oct. 18, 2010, the Vote NO on 8 group wrote: Amendment 8 dramatically increases the number of students per class by at least 20%. In fact, some classes will have over 30 students! The other side of the flierresembles a test question and asks What is the maximum number of students allowed in your classroom? It shows five numbers crossed out ranging from 18 to 29 and a pencil broken in half, then states the answer: 30 or more!If Amendment 8 passes, will there be 30 or more students in a classroom?First, some background. The 2002 amendment was intended to limit classrooms to 18 students per teacher in kindergarten through third grade, 22 for fourth through eighth grade, and 25 for high school classes. The rules apply to core courses, and don't include some courses such as gym or band. The amendment was phased in over time -- last year schools could go over the limit as long as they met average class sizes for the school. This school year was the first timethat districts must meet the caps in each classroom.Amendment 8 would tweak the rules to allow class sizes to be measured based on school averages rather than on individual classrooms -- though there are also caps in terms of how many students can be assigned per teacher.To pass, the amendment needs 60 percent of the vote. Supporters of the amendment say the 2002 rules are too rigid and expensive to implement. According to the Florida Department of Education, districts have spent about $15.8 billion through the 2009-2010 school year on class size implementation statewide and are on track to spend an additional $2.9 billion for the 2010-2011 school year..But opponents say it's crucial to limit class sizes as the previous amendment intended.The Florida Department of Education has a handy website that explains how the rules would change if voters approve the constitutional amendment. The new rules state that the maximum class size would be calculated based on a schoolwide average in core classes:• 18 students in prekindergarten through grade 3;• 22 students in grades 4 through 8;• 25 students in grades 9 through 12.Also, the new rules would set the maximum number of students assigned to each teacher while not exceeding the schoolwide average:• 21 students in prekindergarten through grade 3;• 27 students in grades 4 through 8;• 30 students in grades 9 through 12.Note that the Department of Education says that if Amendment 8 passes, the maximum number of students per classroom would be 30 -- not more than30 -- and that figure only applies in grades 9 through 12. But it isn't as rigid as it seems.We asked Ingrid Olsen, spokeswoman for Vote NO on 8, how the group arrived at the 30 or more figure. Their conclusion is two-fold: one part has to do with those non-core classes such as physical education and band -- a simpler issue we will address first -- and the other part has to do with districts trying to game the system, Olsen says.The class size requirements of this subsection do not apply to extracurricular classes....,'' Olsen wrote in an e-mail Accordingly, a significant number of classes in all grade levels now do, and will continue to be able to exceed the maximum class size goals (i.e., it will not be unusual for those classes to vastly exceed 30 students; it occurs today).Thomas Butler, a spokesman for the Florida Department of Education, confirmed for us that the class size rules don't apply to non-core classes. But that's the case right now -- and will be the case whether Amendment 8 passes or fails.Olsen also wrote:In their attempts to comply with the class size requirements in the absence of the required funding from the state, we are hearing about school districts gaming the system; a practice which will become more widespread if Amendment 8 were to be enacted. Doubling up classes with a primary teacher and an associate teacher, renaming core classes to resemble non-core classes and carrying ghost teacher assignments on rosters, are practices which appear to be occurring today. Amendment 8 will cause increases in those actions.(No -- ghost teachers aren't educators who dress in scary costumes and distribute chocolate bars for Halloween. We'll explain who they are later.)We asked Olsen to point us to specific examples of districts taking such actions. Here are the people and sources she sent us to:• We interviewed Beverley Dowell, who teaches 5th grade language arts and other subjects at Treasure Island Elementary in North Bay Village in Miami-Dade County. Dowell told us that she has 41 students in one of her sections -- the most she has ever had during her on- and off-again teaching career that started in 1971. Dowell said she has a paraprofessional who assists her and sometimes another teacher.Miami-Dade school spokesman John Schuster confirmed Dowell's class size. He said she can have 41 students because the school's reading coach shares responsibilities with the teacher and a paraprofessional assists.• From an Aug. 21, 2010, article in the Miami Herald about schools facing the class size deadline: For a while, some districts considered ignoring the limits and paying millions in fines, figuring that would be cheaper than corralling enough teachers to make the teacher-student ratios work. In the end, most found creative ways to comply, such as offering more Internet-based virtual classes to older students and shifting athletic directors and media specialists into the classrooms to teach.• Several additional news sources across the state stated that some schools are using co-teaching or associate teaching (which adds a lower-paid educator to the classroom) to allow more students in each classroom since there is more than one educator. An Aug. 22, 2010, story in the St. Petersburg Times stated: Some schools have moved to co-teachers, effectively doubling the number of students they can house in a classroom.• A letter from T. Alan Cox, principal of Lawton Chiles High School in Tallahassee, told parents as the new school year approached that One adjustment that was made at Chiles that will allow a core class to have more than twenty-five students is the participation of more than one teacher per class -- a reference to him hiring associate teachers. (The letter we saw did not have a date but it starts with summer is quickly coming to a close.)And now, about those ghost teachers. Lynda Russell, a public policy advocate for the Florida Education Association who is aligned with the Vote NO side, said a ghost teacher refers to math or reading coaches who aren't assigned a classroom because they are floaters who assist students in need. Russell saidcoaches have been asked to sign paperwork showing they are responsible for a classroom -- though they are essentiallyassigned one on paper only,hence the reference to ghost. We asked her for proof that this is occurring and she said she obtained an e-mail from a union official in Osceola County from a coach who raised questions about this practice. We asked for the e-mail but have not received it.Right now we've got this limit that is not adhered to at 25, Russell said. So if Amendment 8 passes, we will have a cap that is not adhered to at 30.We asked Butler, the DOE spokesman, whether districts can use co-teaching to increase those caps on numbers of students in the classroom if Amendment 8 passes. He said co-teaching is allowed and pointed us to a statute that shows several other options including virtual instruction programs or use non-traditional school calendars or hours.If Amendment 8 passes, will there be 30 or more! students in classrooms?That depends. For starters, the class size issue is far too complicated for such a simple numerical claim without explanation on a mailer. The suggestion that there will be 30 or more! students in your classroom could suggest to the average reader that school classes could hit those numbers in any classroom no matter what subject or age.

Final Rating: Half True  ",Weve seen more filibusters on judicial nominees by the Republicans under President Obama than we saw in the whole history of the United States Senate.,"Republicans changed Senate rules to break a Democratic filibuster and confirm Neil Gorsuch to the U.S. Supreme Court, and blamed Democrats for necessitating the change along the way. Democrats, as you might imagine, saw it differently. In a post-mortem on the Senate showdown, Fox News Sundays Chris Wallace asked Sen. Ben Cardin, D-Md., whether the Democrats made a strategic mistake deciding to filibuster Gorsuchs nomination. Cardin said both parties are to blame, noting that Republicans engaged in the same type of action during President Barack Obamas first term, when Republicans held up Obamas judicial nominees. Weve seen more filibusters on judicial nominees by the Republicans under President Obama than we saw in the whole history of the United States Senate, Cardin said April 9. Both sides have blame here. We heard a similar claim on ABCs This Week. Former DNC pollster Cornell Belcher said Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell who blocked more of President Obama's nominees than have been blocked in history. Is that so? Defining, counting filibusters Cardin used the term filibuster, but measuring filibusters is troublesome, experts say, because it has an overly broad meaning. Senators tend to consider any type of obstruction to scheduling a nomination or measure as a filibuster, said Steven Smith, a political scientist at Washington University in St. Louis. The whole use of the term filibuster is problematic, given its evolution over the years, added University of Kansas political scientist Burdett Loomis. It ends up being a regular event, used all the more frequently in more partisan Congresses. As a result, experts say a way to approximate — but not entirely count — filibusters is to count the number of times the Senate attempts to break a filibuster by forcing an up-or-down vote through a process called cloture. In recent years, a cloture motion required the approval of 60 senators. But in 2013, Democrats changed the rules so that a simple majority could invoke cloture for presidential appointments and lower court nominees. The 60-vote threshold stood for legislation and the Supreme Court.  To confirm Gorsuch, Republicans eliminated the 60-vote threshold for Supreme Court nominees. It remains in place for legislation. What the research shows Cardins claim stems from a 2013 report by the Congressional Research Service, the independent research arm of Congress. The document, along with a subsequent memorandum on the report, lists every instance in which a presidential nominee was blocked and cloture was filed through Nov. 20, 2013, when Democrats changed Senate rules.  According to the Congressional Research Service, senators sought attempted cloture action on judicial nominations approximately86 times between 1967 and the end of 2013. (Pre-1967, the Congressional Research Service lists no cloture attempts -- so history as Cardin put it, is relatively short.) Of those, 50 were made before President Barack Obama took office in 2009, and 36 were made between 2009 and when the Senate changed its rules in 2013.Miguel A. Estrada, a judge nominated in 2001 to the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals, saw seven cloture attempts to break a logjam by Senate Democrats before withdrawing his nomination in 2003. So through that prism, Cardin is off. Cardin is closer if you look at individual judicial nominees who were subject to a cloture filing (because nominees like Estrada were subject to a cloture filing multiple times). Pre-Obama, 36 judicial nominees were subject to a cloture filing, we found. From 2009-2013, it was the same -- 36 judicial nominees. To put that in perspective, and to see Cardin's point, look at it this way: Less than one nominee per year was subject to a cloture filing inthe 40 years before Obama took office. From 2009-13, the number of nominees subject to a cloture filing jumped to over seven per year. In 2013, then-Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid was much closer to being correct when he said, In the history of the United States, 168 presidential nominees have been filibustered, 82 blocked under President Obama, 86 blocked under all the other presidents. His figure included non-judicial nominees. As part of that fact-check we noted that By our calculation, there were actually 68 individual nominees blocked prior to Obama taking office and 79 (so far) during Obamas term, for a total of 147. Senate Democratsmade that same point in a tweet April 6. (Cardin's team said Sen. Chuck Schumer's inquiry on the Senate floor was the basis of Cardin's claim.)  Sen. Schumer asked the Parliamentarian to confirm this fact. The Secretary of the Senate, confirms this. pic.twitter.com/pYPLT1DUt2 Our ruling Cardin said, Weve seen more filibusters on judicial nominees by the Republicans under President Obama than we saw in the whole history of the United States Senate. Cardin used an imprecise term, filibuster, to describe a precise Senate parliamentary procedure, cloture. Asfar as cloture data kept by the Congressional Research Service,Cardin would be on safer ground if he avoided focusing on judicial nominees. By our count, cloture was filed on 36 judicial nominations during the first five years of Obama's presidency, the same totalas the previous 40 years combined.",0.5,0.5,1,0.5,0,0.5,0.5,1,0.5,Half True

Final Rating: Mostly True  ",Sen. McConnell says it's not his job to bring jobs to Kentucky.,"President Barack Obama's recently announced plan to cut greenhouse gas emissions from coal-fired power plants 30 percent by 2030 isnt going over so well in coal states. Both senate candidates in Kentucky -- the countrys third-largest coal producer -- are speaking out against the plan and the danger it poses to Kentucky jobs. Democratic candidate Alison Lundergan Grimes jumped at the opportunity to remind voters of a comment by her opponent, incumbent and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., about bringing jobs to Kentucky. In a 60-second radio ad, Grimes first chastises Obama for the emissions plan, then turns to her competitor. Coal supplies 92 percent of our state's electricity, the narrator says. (Obama's) new regulations will lead to severe rate increases, shortages of power and the loss of even more coal jobs. Kentucky already has the fifth-highest unemployment rate in the country. It's bad enough we've lost 18,000 jobs since Mitch McConnell became senator. It's even worse that Senator McConnell says it's not his job to bring jobs to Kentucky. With jobs and unemployment the most important issues for many Americans -- and with Kentucky experiencing 7.7 percent unemployment, which is well above the national average -- we wondered whether McConnell really said this. It turns out that the claim references an interview McConnell gave to The Beattyville Enterprise, a weekly newspaper in Lee County, Ky., with a circulation of about 1,200 and no website, back in April. The six-paragraph-long story ran with the headline, McConnell says not his job to bring jobs. The Grimes campaign pounced on the headline and ran, giving the comment far more attention than the papers original circulation. Heres the full text of the story: U.S. Senator Mitch McConnell said Friday that it is not his responsibility to bring jobs to Kentucky. Appearing in Beattyville, McConnell was asked by The Beattyville Enterprise what he was going to do to bring jobs to Lee County. Economic development is a Frankfort issue, McConnell said. That is not my job. It is the primary responsibility of the state Commerce Cabinet. Asked about public works projects, McConnell said he is interested in bringing public works to the state. Most comes from the state, though, he said. He did say that he is responsible for protecting jobs by pushing back against the Obama Administration's restrictions on the coal industry. Oil and gas are big here, he said of Lee County. They (the Obama Administration) are making it hard on them, too, he said. In an interview with PolitiFact, Edmund Shelby -- the reporter, as well as the papers editor and general manager -- said the interview was quick, taking place in a hallway before McConnell spoke at a luncheon at the town's community center. McConnells point, Shelby said, was that the responsibility for creating Kentucky jobs lies with the state government in Frankfort and the Commerce Cabinet (which is actually now known as the Cabinet for Economic Development). So, while McConnell did say the phrase, that is not my job, in response to a question about bringing jobs to his home state, he said his comments were taken out of context. At a May press conference, McConnell said he thought Shelby was asking him about specific industries in Lee County that are obviously a job of the state Commerce Department. This April, I visited Lee County to talk about a top priority of mine: jobs, McConnell said in an April statement. Unfortunately, it seems my message got lost in translation, and I was surprised to see a headline about my visit that sent the exact opposite message to the one I was trying to convey. Shelby didn't electronically record the exchange, and he didn't stay for the luncheon -- where McConnell made remarks about the economy and jobs. However, Shelby stands by his story and said it is impossible that the comments were taken out of context because the interview was only long enough for the questions included in the article. The Grimes campaign has shrugged off McConnells out of context defense and has sought to make hay of what McConnell was reported to have said. Clearly McConnell made a major error and used the lost in translation excuse to blame a local news editor for accurately reporting on his comments, the Grimes campaign said. However, the not my job statement isnt the only comment McConnell makes in the piece. His later comment that part of his responsibility is to protect Kentucky's jobs from the threat of over-regulation from the federal government and the Obama administration is an argument he often makes in his campaign. In my travels across the Commonwealth, I hear too often how government is blocking job creation, he said in the April statement. Its up to all of us -- at the federal, state and local levels -- to fix that. We must ensure that our utility and tax rates remain low and we must enact a right to work law. The better the atmosphere the state sets for job creators, the more effectively Kentucky can compete against other states to add and retain jobs. Al Cross, director of the Institute for Rural Journalism and Community Issues at the University of Kentucky, said McConnell can point to a record to support his view. McConnell has a long history of doing earmarks and other legislation that helps create and preserve jobs in the state, he said. McConnell spokesman Don Stewart pointed to several pieces of job-protecting legislation that McConnell has sponsored or supported, such as the 2013 Freedom to Fish Act, which supported tourism and hospitality jobs in the Barkley Lake region, which he said brings in $3 million in fishing-related tourism to the state each year. In fiscal year 2010, McConnell was one of the top-10 solo earmarkers in the Senate, securing more than $60 million for 38 projects, according to Taxpayers for Common Sense, a Washington-based advocacy group. Congress banned earmarks soon after the 2010 election. Grimes has used McConnells Beattyville Enterprise comments to promote her own jobs plan, in which she devotes significant attention to criticizing McConnells record. Shelby said he thinks McConnell was saying what he actually thought. Its possible that McConnell thought he was talking to a small-town, bumbling editor, which Shelby is not, he said. In my opinion, Sen. McConnell committed the cardinal sin of career politicians by giving an honest answer to a reporter, said Shelby, a former president of the Kentucky Press Association. Our ruling Grimes said, Sen. McConnell said its not his job to bring jobs to Kentucky. She took this comment from a brief interview McConnell gave to a small-town newspaper in April. We have no reason to doubt the accuracy of the news report, but while the Grimes campaign has a point that McConnell used that particular phrase, they are glossing over some nuances in what he said by selectively quoting the report. McConnell also told the paper that he has a responsibility to protect jobs, and that some of his work in Congress has led to job creation in Kentucky. In addition, McConnells legislative record shows a concern for local employment.",0.8,0.6,1.0,0.7,0.2,0.5,0.6,1.0,0.5,Mostly True

Final Rating: Half True",Says Joni Ernst claims she pushed for new funding for hospitals and COVID-19 testing after opposing It for weeks.,"The Iowa Democratic Party claims in its 2020 campaign against U.S. Sen. Joni Ernst, R-Iowa, that Ernst reversed her support for a coronavirus relief plan 3.5, which offered nearly half a trillion dollars for small businesses, hospitals and testing. The Iowa Democratic Party claimed in the headline of an April 21 statement that Ernst opposed funding for hospitals and COVID-19 testing for weeks before $75 billion to reimburse health-care providers and $25 billion for COVID-19 diagnostic testing was included in an interim coronavirus relief bill passed by the Senate April 21 and signed by President Trump April 24. Its a claim Democrats have continued to make against Ernst. Both Republicans and Democrats blocked interim economic relief packages proposed by the other party in April before the final half-a-trillion-dollar package cleared the Senate. The Republicans proposal wouldve solely funded the quickly depleted Paycheck Protection Program, a loan program created by the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act and launched April 4 for businesses that keep employees on their payroll. Democrats pushed for a $500-billion-dollar-plus aid package with Paycheck Protection Program funds as well as $100 billion for hospitals and $150 billion for state and local government, of which some of the hospital funds made it into the final deal. Iowa Democratic Party Communications Director Jeremy Busch referred in an interview with The Daily Iowan to a series of interviews and public statements Ernst made in April as proof her tune had changed on the expanded relief funding. As negotiations on refilling the Paycheck Protection Program were ongoing, Ernst said in an April 16 Fox News interview she supported the program and disagreed with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi that Congress should wait. We have small businesses that desperately need this funding to keep their employees on payroll. If they can't do that, those employees will go unemployed and that is not the route. So, I do believe that what we had was a narrowly crafted bill to replenish the funds for PPP, but the Democrats wanted to hijack it with unrelated items and additional changes. We have a program that's working, now we need to make sure that it's properly funded. In an email to the Daily Iowan's PolitiFact Iowa, Ernsts spokesperson, Brendan Conley, wrote that Ernsts comment on unrelated items and additional changes referred to an early House version of what eventually became the CARES Act, the third relief bill. The version Conley referred to was noted in a March 23 article in the Hill; it didnt clear the Senate but included funding to curb airline pollution. However, the Paycheck Protection Program launched after that article, on April 3, as part of the $2.2 trillion CARES Act, making it unlikely that the narrowly crafted bill to replenish the funds for PPP referred to the measure that created the loan program. The proposal that better fits what Ernst is describing in the Fox News interview wouldve bumped up funding for the Paycheck Protection Program. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, asked senators on April 9 to approve with unanimous consent a measure that would have added $250 million in federal funds to the Paycheck Protection Program. He argued on the Senate floor that the small business loan program's funds were running out and that negotiations for hospital, local government, and test funding should be part of a separate congressional package at a later date. The reason: the extra funding wouldnt pass unanimously, he said. However, McConnells measure did not receive unanimous consent, as two Democrats voiced opposition. No formal recorded vote was taken to gauge Senate support for the initial proposal, so there's no formal record of Ernst's support or opposition to that measure. Minutes after the two Democratic senators from Maryland rejected McConnells ask to fast-track the measure, the pair proposed their own amendment which was double the dollar figure of McConnells. It included $100 billion for hospitals dealing with COVID-19 and $150 billion for state and local governments. A final proposal to McConnells original interim bill included $500 billion for hospitals, the Paycheck Protection Program and COVID-19 testing, but none for local government. The Senate approved that measure April 21 with unanimous consent, a procedural fast-tracking move that means no senators voiced opposition. Again, the Senate didnt record a vote tally, but Conley wrote to the DI in an email that Ernst supported that half-a-trillion-dollar bill. A day before the final proposal was approved in the Senate, Ernst said in an April 20 town hall, that she supported the $3.5 coronavirus relief bills extra $75 billion to reimburse health-care providers and $25 billion for COVID-19 diagnostic testing. We will also get the additional dollars we wanted for diagnostic testing an additional $25 billion there as well as another $75 billion for our hospitals. And again this is something that Ive pushed for because we want to make sure that our rural hospitals are sustaining through this COVID-19 pandemic, Ernst said. Conley wrote in an April 24 email to the Daily Iowan: Sen.Ernst fully supports the additional funding for hospitals and testing —which are very much related to the COVID-19 pandemic — as she reiterated on Monday (April 20), and that's exactly why she supported the bill that passed the Senate this week. Her voting record shows, in no uncertain terms, that she supports those measures. In other statements as well before the final interim package passed, Ernst reiterated her support for a narrower agreement. According to a RadioIowa report, Ernst said April 16 that discussions about extra funding for hospitals and local governments could wait until Congress passed the PPP funds. No political gimmicks, just a simple ask to put more money in this program, RadioIowa reported Ernst saying. Unfortunately, politics got in the way. In a statement from Ernsts office April 9, the day Democrats and Republicans rejected each others interim relief plans, Ernst criticized Democrats for rejecting Republicans proposal, stating that passing small business loan relief funds was too urgent to delay. After hearing from Iowans and seeing the overwhelming response of small businesses across the country, its clear we need to bolster the Paycheck Protection Program. We dont have time for political games; were in a crisis. Workers and employers in Iowa and across the country need this relief now more than ever, so lets put aside the politics and swiftly get this specific additional support for small businesses approved so money can keep flowing, Iowa workers can continue to collect a paycheck, and our states small businesses can stay afloat, Ernst said. Congress put $350 billion toward the PPP at it's creation. The program stopped taking applications when the funds ran dry April 16 date, and resumed taking applications April 27. The interim package was one of several COVID-19 relief packages Congress has passed. The Iowa Democratic Party claimed that Ernst reversed her support for a coronavirus relief in a recent bill that offered nearly half a trillion dollars for small businesses, hospitals and testing. Due to a lack of concrete voting record, we reviewed Ernst's statements before and after the passage of the interim coronavirus-relief bill. Ernst hasn't said she directly opposed hospital funding, but in public statements she was critical of putting a proposal on the floor with funding that was more broad than the Paycheck Protection Program. When Democrats brought their version of the interim relief proposal, which included extra dollars for hospitals and local government, to the senate floor April 9, McConnell objected. Ernst is the Vice Chair of the Senate GOP Conference, meaning she is part of Republican leadership. However, she didnt vote down additional funds for hospitals or COVID-19 testing in the final half-a-trillion-dollar package. She said later she pushed for hospital funding included in the interim relief package. But, she never said she directly opposed that funding. Rather, she said it should be discussed at a later date. The claim is partially accurate but needs additional context. ",0.5,0.5,0.8,0.5,0.3,0.4,0.6,0.7,0.5,Half True

Final Rating: Mostly True",Lee Zeldin voted for Cuomos Billion Dollar Tax hike and every Cuomo budget.,"Republican gubernatorial candidate Harry Wilson aims to discredit one of the leading candidates in the GOP primary, Rep. Lee Zeldin, with claims that Zeldin supported the economic plans put forth over the years by then-Gov. Andrew Cuomo, a Democrat. Wilson, a businessman from Westchester County, claims in anadthatLee Zeldin was Andrew Cuomos favorite Republican. The ad goes on to say Zeldin voted for Cuomos Billion Dollar Tax hike and every Cuomo budget. Primaries for statewide offices are set for June 28. Former Westchester County Executive Rob Astorino and former Trump administration aide Andrew Giuliani are also running in the Republican primary for governor. Zeldin, a Long Island congressman, was elected to the state Senate in 2010and served two terms. We checked his voting record on every state budget during that time. Each budget was passed in multiple bills, addressing revenue, aid to localities, and debt service among other parts, and lawmakers vote on each of them. Zeldin voted in favor of all of the budget bills during his years in the state Senate. Many of these bills passed with overwhelming support in the Senate, sometimes without anysenator voting against them. During this period, Republicans controlled the Senate, at times with support from the Independent Democratic Caucus, and they negotiated with the Assemblys Democratic leadership and the Cuomo administration. We asked Wilsons campaign about his claim that Zeldin voted in favor of a billion-dollar tax hike. Campaign spokesperson Alex Wilkes said that in 2011, Zeldin supported the state budget's $1.9 billion tax increase, (revenue was set to increase by that much, though supporters of the tax reform package would say that rates actually went down) and in 2013Zeldin voted for the state budget that included an extension of a tax targeting high earners. The tax was set to expire in 2014, but the budget votein March 2013 extended it until 2017. Some observers, like E.J. McMahon, a close watcher of state finances and a fiscal conservative, called the extension in 2013 a tax increase. The tax on high earners was supposed to end, but Cuomo and the Legislature kept it in place, resulting in a 29% increase for high earners, McMahon said. He reached that figure by calculating what they would have paid had the tax targeting high earners expired and what they paid under the rate established by the plan passed by the lawmakers. Following the tax reform in late 2011, tax receipts were projected to increase by $1.9 billion. According to the Cuomo administration,the budget for the 2013 fiscal year (April 1, 2012, through March 31, 2013,)raised more tax revenue, though it also created savings for the middle class.An April 2012 report from the Cuomo administration projected a $2 billion increase in tax receipts from what was collected in fiscal year 2012 and what it expected to collect in fiscal year 2013. An expected gross increase of $1.9 billion was attributed totax reform. This reform package lowered rates slightly for the highest earners, but did not bring them down to what they would havebeen had the higher rates been allowed to expire.The report also projected a $250 million decrease in tax revenue from an MTA payroll tax relief plan for small businesses and a decrease of $135 million from tax credits and other initiatives. Though the tax reforms were a revenue-raiser for the state, the budget division wrote: The tax reform measures are intended to enhance fairness in the tax system and are expected to provide $900 million in savings for middle class New Yorkers and small business. When asked about Wilsons claim, Zeldin spokesperson Katie Vincentz pointed to thedownstate payroll tax break, anda middle-income tax cut, both agreed to as part of the 2011 tax package, and said all of the budgets contained conservative wins. Vincentz also said the budgets shouldn't be calledCuomo budgets, because they were negotiated with and voted on by the Legislatureand that members of the Senate majority changed Cuomos budget proposals. Wilson claims Zeldin voted for Cuomos Billion Dollar Tax hike and every Cuomo budget. While in the state Senate, Zeldin did vote for a final version of every budget that Cuomo proposed. But calling it Cuomos budget erases the role the state Legislature played in negotiating and making changes to Cuomos proposals. The changes to the tax rates were intended to bringin more revenue, though many in the state experienced a tax cut. The highest earners paid a lower rate than they had been paying, but more than they would have paid if the rate had been allowed to expire.",0.7,0.5,1.0,0.6,0.0,0.4,0.3,1.0,0.6,Mostly True

Final Rating: Mostly False  ","Says Maxine Waters said: I say, we knock off Trump and then, go after Pence. We have the power.","A viral post on Facebook claims that U.S. Rep. Maxine Waters made a violence-inciting remark about President Donald Trump and Vice President Mike Pence. The image shows an image of the California Democrat standing at a podium. It attributes this quote to her, saying she said it Sept. 17, 2018: I say, we knock off Trump and then, go after Pence. We have the power. Below the quote, the post says: Yes, she actually said this and then blames President Trump for inciting violence. Worth repinning! Why isnt she in jail?? The post was flagged as part of Facebooks efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Waters was one of the earliest elected officials supporting impeachment of Trump, calling for it just a few months after he took office in January 2017. While she didnt make this exact comment, it appears she did say something similar, but it was in the context of impeachment, not violence. Waters called for Trumps impeachment during a September 2018 event of the National Newspaper Publishers Association, which represents African American-owned community newspapers. All I want for him and about him is to be impeached and get him out of the White House, she said, according to a Sept. 17, 2018 article by Fox News. It continues to say that Waters said she would go after Pence if Trump were to be removed from office. The article — like other websites that reported on the speech — embedded a YouTube video of her comments in the report. But that video is no longer available online. We searched Google and the Nexis news archives and found that the most extensive reporting about Waters address came from conservative websites. The American Mirror, a conservative blog by Kyle Olson, reported that after Waters said, All I want for him and about him is to be impeached and get him out of the White House!she dismissed criticism that an ousted Trump would make Pence president. Then, according to the website: Knock off the first one, and then go after the second one, she said. We have the power. We have the numbers, but weve got to understand our power and weve got to use our power. We reached out to the National Newspaper Publishers Association to see if we could get more information about exactly what Waters said, but the organization did not respond to our request for information. Waters has made similar statements, before and since. Each of them were also in the context of impeachment: Aug. 4, 2017: Interviewed on The View TV show, Waters had this exchange with co-host Joy Behar. Behar: Do you think Pence will be better than Trump if he were impeached? Waters: No. And when we finish with Trump we have to go and get Putin. Hes next. Behar: Putin or Pence? Waters: Uh, Pence. Oct. 20, 2017: Speaking at an event for homeless LGBTQ people in honor of a man named Ali Forney: Wow, what a moving evening this is. I'm sitting here listening, watching, absorbing, thinking about Ali even though I never met him. And with this kind of inspiration, I will go and take out Trump tonight. (CNN published the quote based on a video that has since been removed from YouTube.) In an interview four days later, Waters rejected the idea that she was vowing harm to Trump: That's absolutely ridiculous ... that a 79-year-old grandmother who is a congresswoman and who has been in Congress and politics all these years doing any harm. The only harm I might be doing to the president is I want him impeached. Sept. 8, 2018: Speaking at a Democratic club event: Referring to the highest office of the land, Waters said (starting at the 13:45 mark in the video): I wake up in the middle of the night and all I can think about is I am going to get him. About a minute later, Waters told the group that leadership had asked her not to say the word impeachment anymore. And when they say that, I say impeachment, impeachment, impeachment, impeachment, she said to laughter. Waters also said she was told that if Trump were impeached, Pence would be worse. And I said, look, one at a time. You knock one down and then well be ready for Pence. Well get him, too. Waters office did not respond to our requests for information. A Facebook post claimed that Waters said in September 2018: I say, we knock off Trump and then, go after Pence. We have the power. We found no record that Waters made this exact statement. However, Fox News reported that Waters said something similar about Trump: All I want for him and about him is to be impeached and get him out of the White House, and that she would go after Pence if Trump were to be removed from office. While Waters has repeatedly stated her intention to get Trump and/or Pence, it has been in the context of Congress exercising its power to impeach a president and not, as the viral post suggests, to advocate violence.",0.5,0.8,1.0,0.6,0.5,0.7,0.4,1.0,0.4,Mostly False

Sessions' comment does get to the heart of the controversy surrounding the government's position on the case, but Sessions paints the substance of those arguments with a very broad brush and ignores the limits of the legal questions involved. The case before the Supreme Court challenged the application of a campaign reform bill known as the McCain-Feingold Act with respect to whether the nonprofit corporation Citizens United could air a video critical of then-presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. In a broader sense, though, the issue was whether the government had the authority to ban corporate or labor union funding of independent political broadcasts advocating for a candidate just prior to an election. In her oral arguments before the Supreme Court, Kagan argued that pamphlets were pretty classic electioneering, and therefore fell into the category of corporate-financed election materials that could be limited by the McCain-Feingold Act. Now, corporations could still form separate political action committees (PACs) to get their message out. But Kagan said she argued in favor of the position taken by Congress that corporations and labor unions had such a corrupting influence on elections that they should not be allowed to directly fund political messages for or against a particular candidate very close to an election. In a 5-4 decision, the Supreme Court went the other way, arguing that the First Amendment protects the speech of corporations and individuals alike. In his concurring opinion, Justice John Roberts wrote that the government's position asks us to embrace a theory of the First Amendment that would allow censorship not only of television and radio broadcasts, but of pamphlets, posters, the Internet, and virtually any other medium that corporations and unions might find useful in expressing their views on matters of public concern. So, right off the bat, we are talking about pamphlets directly funded by corporations or labor unions. That's a big qualifier left out of Sessions' comment. And Sessions' point is further muddled when he drops in the example of Thomas Paine's pamphlet Common Sense, -- which in 1776 argued for American independence from British rule. Paine's 48-page pamphlet was not corporate-financed, so it's technically not applicable in this discussion. And it might not have been even if it was. Solicitor Kagan was arguing that, under the Federal Election Campaign Act, corporate funds could not be used to publish a pamphlet that expressly advocated the election or defeat of a specific candidate for federal office, said Brett Kappel, an attorney specializing in ethics and lobbying law at the Washington, D.C.-based law firm Arent Fox. The Act would not have prevented Thomas Paine from publishing Common Sense since that famous pamphlet had nothing to do with candidates running for office. Today it would be considered an issue ad, not an electioneering communication. The Federal Election Commission doesn't regulate advertising unless it includes the name or image of a candidate for federal office, Kappel noted. Others argue that whether Common Sense was technically not corporate-financed is not the issue. Common Sense itself was probably not published by a corporation, but in today's world, it surely would have been, said Bradley A. Smith, Professor of Law at Capital University Law School. How many such efforts can you name that are not? The statement by Sessions was a bit of rhetorical excess, perhaps, said Sean Parnell, president of the Center for Competitive Politics, a campaign-finance advocacy group. Obviously, he said, Sessions could have added a good bit of context. Kagan never argued that the government could ban any pamphlet. Nonetheless, Parnell said, in the context of limited corporate-financed political messages, Sessions' comment accurately described Kagan's position that in addition to a video, the government could ban a pamphlet. During some close questioning by Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, on the Citizens United issue on the second day of the confirmation hearing, Kagan quickly framed the limits of the issue, stating that the statute ''applies only to corporations and unions when they make independent expenditures, not to their PACs ... within a certain period of an election. She also noted that as solicitor general, she was defending the statute as written by Congress, which made the determination broadly that corporations and trade unions had this corrupting influence on Congress. And the statute as it was written applies to pamphlets as well as to the movie in the case, and we made a vigorous argument that the application of that statute to any kind of classic electioneering materials, not books -- because they aren't typically used to electioneer -- but that the application of the statutes to any kinds of classic electioneering materials was in fact constitutional and that the court should defer to Congress' view of the need for this, Kagan said. Given the time constraints on opening statements, we are willing to allow Sessions a bit of rhetorical leeway. Kagan did argue that pamphlets should be included in the types of communication the government could prohibit. But again, that's in the context of pamphlets paid for directly by corporations or labor unions making independent expenditures (not through their PAC) for a pamphlet advocating for a specific candidate within the last months of an election. That's an awful lot of limiting context left out. And the point is further muddled by using the example of Paine's Common Sense. It's not at all clear that that pamphlet would have fallen under the regulation of the McCain-Feingold Act.",0.5,0.5,1,0.5,0,0.5,0.5,1,0.5,Half True

Final Rating: Half True  ",Dan Patrick got caught not paying his taxes and pocketed his employees payroll taxes.,"David Dewhurst says the Republican who led him in the March 2014 primary for the partys lieutenant governor nomination has a financially shaky background. Dewhurst, lieutenant governor since 2003, faces challenger Dan Patrick, a Houston state senator, in a May 27, 2014, primary runoff. In Dewhurst's video ad that came public April 16, 2014, the narrator said Patrick got caught not paying his taxes and pocketed his employees payroll taxes. In the ad, those claims are prefaced by an excerpt from a lieutenant governor debate in which a reporter said Patrick had walked away from more than $800,000 in debts when he declared personal bankruptcy. Patricks bankruptcy filing has been covered before. But did he get caught not paying taxes and also pocket employee payroll taxes? Backup from news story, tax liens Via the Quorum Report, a Capitol newsletter, we came to a Dewhurst web page on his ad attributing most of what he said to a Sept. 19, 2013, Dallas Morning News story on Patricks financial troubles. According to the News' story, Patrick filed for bankruptcy in October 1986 under his birth name, Dannie Scott Goeb, and walked away from about $800,000 in debts. The story said that years later, he legally changed his name to Dan Patrick. The bankruptcy was connected to a failed business venture. According to a January 2007 Texas Monthly story, Patrick and others in the 1980s had opened Dan and Nicks Sportsmarket, one of the first sports bars in the U.S. Located in tony Rice Village, the combination bar and restaurant was all polished brass and fine woods, full of local jocks and celebrities, TVs tuned constantly to sporting events. (Too constantly: The NFL would sue Patrick and five other bar owners in 1987 for showing blacked-out games.) For a while the business thrived, largely on the strength of Patricks personality, the story said, but he soon fell prey to the same financial lunacy that infected so many Houstonians in the early eighties. He bought another bar and restaurant, and then another, expanding, finally, to five. Then the oil bust hit, and in short order the man who had made $100,000 as a sportscaster closed four of his businesses, declared bankruptcy, and watched his annual income plummet to $10,000. Payroll taxes unpaid When Patrick filed for bankruptcy, the News story said, he listed more than $816,000 in debts and just over $104,000 in assets. Among his debtors, the story said, was the Internal Revenue Service, which Patrick owed $13,186 in federal income taxes withheld from his restaurant employees paychecks. By email, Dewhurst campaign spokeswoman Eliza Vielma sent us information indicating that from April 1986 into November 1988, Patricks companies were hit with five federal tax liens totaling $18,272.26--with unpaid employee payroll taxes comprising the bulk of that total. Vielma pointed out too that Patricks online response to the Dewhurst claim concedes he filed for personal bankruptcy and once owed payroll taxes. Patricks ad response states his bankruptcy filing doesnt prove he collected and pocketed the taxes, adding: This is not a defense; however, it is a technical distinction. According to Patrick, these taxes were ultimately paid and the debt to the federal government was settled. Generally, employers collect half of each employees payroll taxes and pony up the other half, with the resulting money going to the federal government for Medicare and Social Security. The essence of Dewhursts charge appears to be that Patrick pocketed payroll taxes paid by workers in failing to forward it to the IRS. The News story said Patrick also owed smaller amounts in property taxes to two Houston-area school districts, who later sued his companies for nonpayment. And his businesses were slapped with more than two dozen tax liens by federal, state and local governments. Patrick said he worked extra jobs and eventually paid off the IRS, the newspaper said, also quoting Patrick as saying he couldnt recall details of his bankruptcy cases closing in 1992. More than a decade later, as he got ready for his first bid for the Senate, the story said, Patrick cleared up all the tax liens through the secretary of states office. Patrick: Taxes paid up We asked Patricks campaign for relevant documentation. Logan Spence, his campaign manager, emailed us state and federal documents showing that in April 1986, an IRS administrator signed off on a lien against Patricks company of $15,356.68 for unpaid employee payroll taxes. Another document showed an IRS official approving a lien of $4,297.22 for unpaid federal income taxes. At our inquiry, the Morning News emailed us excerpts from Patricks bankruptcy case file. The provided 10 pages show Patricks bankruptcy filing was initiated Oct. 27, 1986 and was closed Oct. 22, 1992. Also, a document indicates, Patrick (whose legal name was then Goeb) was released from all dischargeable debts on May 4, 1987. But 941 taxes incurred by Watchbear, Inc., in 1985 and 1986 were still owed to the federal government, another document indicates, totaling $13,186.29--a figure that matches what the News story described as taxes withheld from restaurant employees pay checks. By phone, Spence noted the $13,186 figure on the bankruptcy filing was accompanied by the words less recent payment, which Spence described as referring to Patrick already paying some unpaid taxes. Saying all of Patricks debts associated with the bankruptcy of his restaurants have been settled, Spence also emailed a photo of a Nov. 5, 1990, letter from an IRS official to Patrick, whose legal last name remained Goeb, stating that $13,186.29 had been paid in full on Nov. 6, 1989. Spence also emailed documents indicating that in January and February 2006, then-State Comptroller Carole Keeton Strayhorn cleared Patrick of liens for sales taxes previously unpaid to the City of Houston and Metropolitan Transit Authority of Harris County totaling $11,717.73. At the time, Patrick was making his first run for the Senate. Experts say records inconclusive about 'pocketing' By email and telephone, a couple tax and accounting experts who looked over the News-provided documents at our request said they indicate Patricks company failed to submit payroll taxes to the government, though both said the documents did not demonstrate Patrick pocketed the employee shares of payroll taxes--or otherwise. Arthur Agulnek, who teaches accounting at the University of Texas at Dallas, said the 941 liens show Patrick failed to pay the payroll taxes to the IRS; he didnt pay it where it was supposed to go. Michael Harris, a professor of accounting at St. Edwards University, speculated: The money was very likely spent on other bills. Our ruling Dewhurst said Patrick got caught not paying taxes and pocketed employees payroll taxes. The first part of this claim is backed up by records showing the IRS filed liens because Patricks company didnt submit payroll taxes in parts of 1985 and 1986. Patrick also had liens filed against him for unpaid state and local sales taxes. Documents indicate Patrick caught up on his federal tax tab in 1989 and met his sales tax obligations in 2006, the year he ran for the Senate. We see no confirmation, though, that Patrick pocketed employees payroll taxes, though such taxes did go unpaid to the government at times.

Final Rating: Mostly False  ",This is what Kamala Harris thinks about young Americans  They are stupid!,"Did vice presidential nominee Sen. Kamala Harris call young Americans stupid, as a post on social media claims? In an image posted by a Facebook page called Students for Trump, we see a photo of Harris next to a quote that reads, What else do we know about this population, 18 through 24? They are stupid! The posts caption says: This is what Kamala thinks about young Americans?! The quote is part of something Harris said six years ago, but rather than insulting young voters, Harris made the comment during a speech about the need to forgive mistakes made by young, low-level criminal offenders. The post was flagged as part of Facebooks efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Harris made the remark during an address on criminal justice policy at a symposium hosted by the Ford Foundation in May 2014, when she was Californias attorney general. The quote on its own is missing the context of the larger point that Harris was trying to make, which was how the criminal justice system shouldnt penalize young adults for making certain mistakes. The full video of her remarks (her comment comes around the 16:45-mark) shows that Harris is talking about forgiving young peoples low-level crimes, and how the system treats offenders in the age group during what she referred to as their most developmental stage in life. When I was at Howard University and we were in college, we were 18 through 24, and you know what we were called? College kids. But when you turn 18 and youre in the system, you are considered an adult, period. Without any regard to the fact that, that is the very phase of life in which we have invested billions of dollars in colleges and universities knowing that is the prime phase of life during which we mold and shape and direct someone to become a productive adult. Whats the other thing we know about this population? And its a specific phase of life, remember, age is more than a chronological fact. What else do we know about this population, 18 through 24? They are stupid (audience laughs). That is why we put them in dormitories, and they have a resident assistant. They make really bad decisions. So we focused on that age population. Harris was describing a recidivism reduction program for first-time, low-level offenders in Los Angeles. The initiative, modeled after the Back on Track program that Harris launched in 2005 in San Francisco, would provide services to young Americans who were convicted of nonviolent felonies. If they met certain education and career goals, they would have their cases dismissed. A post on Facebook says Harris called young Americans stupid. Its a partial quote of something Harris said. Harris was speaking about initiatives to reduce recidivism rates for young, low-level offenders and wryly made a comment about how young adults often make bad decisions in order to illustrate the broader point that more empathy is needed for them within the criminal justice system. Harris made the comment, but the post leaves out important details or takes things out of context.

Final Rating: Half True  ","A new manufacturing plant is slated to create about 3,000 jobs in central and northeast Georgia and create about a $3 billion infusion into the economy.","Primary Election Day is less than two months away, which means U.S. Rep. Paul Broun of Athens is busy burnishing his accomplishments.Broun marked the recent launch of his re-election campaign by saying his proudest achievement is helping to lure the manufacturer Caterpillar to the Athens area, where it will open a plant to make construction equipment, he said in a television interview.Caterpillars factory is going to create about 3,000 jobs here in central Georgia and northeast Georgia. Its going to be about a $3 billion infusion of cash into our economy, Broun said May 23 on WMGT-TV in Macon.Those numbers make it sound like Broun is doing a heck of a lot for his constituents. But is he padding his resume?Landing the 1 million-square-foot Caterpillar plant was a coup for Georgia. Gov. Nathan Deal announced the victory himself, and both his office and Caterpillar headquarters issued news releases that described the plants economic impact.Caterpillar will invest about $200 million to open the plant, and it expects to employ 1,400 people when it opens for business in late 2013, the Governors Office announced. In return, the state and its taxpayers are giving the company a $75 million package of incentives.PolitiFact Georgia called and emailed Brouns office for more than a week but received no replies. So we took to our own research and found that Brouns figures are problematic.First of all, Brouns figures dont match the estimates by Caterpillar.Caterpillars news release about the new facility cited economic impact figures from Sharon Younger, who runs a market research firm with headquarters in Jackson, Tenn., that also specializes in public relations.Youngers research was funded by Caterpillar, although she did not know what firm she was working for when she did her calculations, she told PolitiFact Georgia.Younger told PolitiFact Georgia that she estimated the impact for 12 counties that surround the plants site: Banks, Barrow, Clark, DeKalb, Gwinnett, Jackson, Madison, Morgan, Oconee, Oglethorpe, Rockdale and Walton.The Caterpillar plant will create more than 3,600 jobs for this area, and its economic impact will total about $2 billion in a single year when it starts running, Younger said. (In Caterpillars news release, she placed the impact at about $2.4 billion.)When compared with Caterpillars official estimate, Brouns job number is about 17 percent too low, while his economic impact number is about a half-billion dollars too high.Also, Brouns geography is wrong. Caterpillars impact figures are for counties in northeast Georgia only. None of the counties Younger considered are in Middle Georgia.Younger released only the bare outlines of her methodology, saying most of the information is proprietary. This means that no one can verify her numbers. Younger defended her estimates by saying that she used a standard method to make them. But that doesnt mean her estimates are correct. PolitiFact Georgia frequently writes about economic impact studies, and weve found that the information she did not release can make the difference between a credible study and one thats bunk.This is why:Researchers must predict how much a new factory will change economic activity in the local area in order to make an accurate economic impact estimate, according to the manual that outlines the method that Younger used and Bruce Seaman, an economist with Georgia State University. This prediction is crucial, Seaman said. If the Caterpillar plant gets all its parts and materials for its excavators from the Athens area, itll have a much bigger impact on the local economy than it would if it uses steel from China and electronics from Germany. Figuring out how much of this activity takes place locally can take a great deal of research. Younger said she did this work but did not detail how.Another impact estimate released by a University of Georgia expert is more conservative. Jeffrey Humphreys, the director of UGAs Selig Center for Economic Growth, said the economic impact would be $1.4 billion, according to an article in The Atlanta Journal-Constitution.For each job at the plant, 2.4 will be created across the state. Caterpillars estimate was for a smaller 12-county region.Humphreys was on leave and could not be contacted by deadline.How do we rule?Brouns jobs figure is lower than those released by Caterpillar, while the amount of economic impact he described is at least a half-billion dollars higher than the one the company gave.Broun also gave an incorrect description for the region covered by Caterpillars economic estimate. Its for northeast Georgia, not northeast and Middle Georgia. Caterpillars estimates were not peer-reviewed or conducted by an independent professional. Most importantly, the methodology behind them is not transparent.Brouns overarching point is this: The new Caterpillar plant will bring a lot of jobs and inject a lot of money into Georgias economy. But he strays on some of the finer points, and PolitiFact could not verify the methodology used to come up with some of the numbers.His estimates need a lot of context and clarification, even though his larger point has merit.We therefore rule Brouns statement Half-True.",0.5,0.5,1.0,0.5,0.0,0.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,Half True

Final Rating: Half True  ","In a period of roughly 72 hours, a small group of angry black students managed to force the resignation of the two highest ranking officials at that school.","A heated debate over race has erupted on several college campuses. This prompted Fox News host Megyn Kelly to lead off her show Wednesday this way: What started as a campus protest in Missouri might be spreading to more colleges and universities as small groups of students use complaints about race and diversity in a big play to rewrite the rules for everyone, Kelly said on the Nov. 11, 2015, edition of The Kelly File. In a period of roughly 72 hours, a small group of angry black students managed to force the resignation of the two highest-ranking officials at that school, complaining they did not show enough concern about racial issues at the school. There have been conflicting reports over what led Missouri University president Tim Wolfe and chancellor R. Bowen Loftin to step down Nov. 9. We thought it would help to examine Kellys summary that a small group of black students forced that much change in basically three days. The Fox News press office added some nuance to the short timeline Kelly cited. A spokesperson told us while tensions formed weeks ago, things came to a head in the three days before the resignations. Events did pile up quickly in the days before Nov. 9 but evidence coming out of Missouri paints a much more complicated picture than the one Kelly offered her viewers. Most importantly, Wolfe and Loftin fell for different reasons. Race relations were the dominant factor in Wolfes demise, but Loftins problems stemmed from a revolt among the universitys deans that peaked a month earlier. It also seems that opposition to both men was broader than, as Kelly said, a small group of angry black students. The standard (simple) storyline Fox News told us that a Google search pulled up more than 8,000 news articles about the role of the students in the resignations. The stories we read generally noted the same series of events leading up to the administrative shake-up at Mizzou. In mid September this year, the president of the Missouri Student Association wrote on Facebook that riders in a pick-up truck had repeatedly used a racial slur toward him. In early October, as a black student group rehearsed outdoors for a homecoming performance, a passing white student began using a racial slur. A few days later on Oct. 10, about a dozen black students surrounded the Missouri presidents vehicle demanding that he address racial tensions on campus. Roughly two weeks after that, feces smeared in the shape of a swastika appeared on a college dorm. No suspect was found. On Nov. 2, a black student started a hunger strike. On Nov. 7, a group of black players on Missouris football team announced they would neither practice nor play until Wolfe, the president, resigned. Missouri football coach Gary Pinkel tweeted his support for the players strike Nov. 8. On Nov. 9, both Wolfe and Loftin resigned. (Loftin said he would remain with the university in a different role.) Its easy to understand why the downfall of the two men would merge in the public mind, but that doesnt make it accurate. Loftins long decline Its important to note that Loftin answered to Wolfe. As university president, Wolfe oversaw the entire university system. Loftin ran all of the academic divisions of the university, from the medical school, to the law school, to the college of arts and sciences, and more. You dont have to look far to discover that Loftins relationship with large swaths of the university community was on the rocks for reasons having nothing to do with the bubbling racial tensions. In fact,nine of the universitysdeansin charge of academic divisions asked for Loftins removal a month before he stepped down.(Interim and acting deans did not participate.) We said to the president on Oct. 9 that Loftin should go, Dave Kurpius, dean of the Journalism School told PunditFact. Kurpius said the deans repeated that demand to Wolfe at three meetings in early October. The morning Wolfe resigned in November, they had just sent a letter to Wolfes boss, the board of curators, calling for Loftins removal. That letter blamed Loftin for creating a toxic environment through threat, fear and intimidation. Their specific issues involved his botched effort to eliminate graduate assistant health insurance and a total disregard for their roles as managers of their academic centers. Graduate students also had been opposing Loftin. Sarah Senff is co-chair of the Action Committee on the Forum on Graduate Rights. The group was formed in August after Loftin gave them less than a days notice that they would lose their health insurance assistance. After an outcry, Loftin reversed himself. I would vociferously deny that this happened in 72 hours or that this was just black students,  Senff said. Particularly for Chancellor Loftin, there were numerous issues relating to his competence to lead the university. Senff and other graduate student leaders we contacted cited a bevy of problems including cutbacks in aid for housing, childcare, and tuition waivers. They also rejected Loftins decision in September to sever ties with a Planned Parenthood clinic where medical and nursing students had been going to fulfill hands-on experience requirements. Senff said it has been a semester thathas seen protest after protest from various groups. The graduate students woes spilled over to the academic departments. William Kerwin is director of graduate studies at Missouris English department. On Nov. 3, the faculty voted to declare No confidence in Loftin. Their complaints mirrored those of the deans and graduate students. A whole host of issues were in play regarding Chancellor Loftin, Kerwin said, Yet the national narrative now sees his departure as driven by the same forces as ended President Wolfes tenure here. It is not as though this story was unknown outside of Missouri. The day before Kellys show, the Wall Street Journal published an article with the headline Race Wasnt the Only Issue at University of Missouri. Wolfes sudden demise University of Missouri insiders we contacted uniformly told us that race relations were the driving factor in Wolfes resignation. Several highlighted his refusal to engage with black students after the incidents in September and October. That precipitated the moment when a dozen activists surrounded his car at the October homecoming. When Wolfe told a group of black students on Nov. 7 that systematic oppression is because you dont believe that you have the equal opportunity for success, the uproar only intensified. Eric Scott, a graduate student leader, said its accurate to say a core group of black students organized protests. But Smith, who is white, said that hardly captures the extent of the popular rejection of Wolfe. If we count all the people who have participated in their marches and demonstrations, there were hundreds of members, Smith said. Hardly a small group of angry black students.  Samuel Cohen is an associate English professor. He said Kelly had it right regarding the general role of the students and racial tensions. What she missed, he said, was the two or three months of growing frustration and the upswell of support for his ouster. The tipping point, Cohen said, was the football players who put their scholarships and careers on the line. It is technically correct to say it was a small group of students, but if they had been protesting the campus smoking ban or the chancellor's twitter handle, it wouldn't have led anywhere. he said. It had to be something important that many others saw as worth fighting against. The others who joined in, Cohen said, included students, faculty and staff of many ethnicities. Our ruling Kelly said in a span of about three days, a small group of black students forced the resignations of two top administrators at the University of Missouri. Multiple press reports and interviews with members of the Mizzou community tell us Kellys shorthand falls short on several key points. Deans, graduate students, and faculty had been pressing for the ouster of Loftin for at least a month prior to his departure. It is no small matter for deans to make such a demand and they did so three times in early October. Loftins problems with the university community go back well into the beginning of the semester. Theres more support for the role of black students in the removal of Wolfe. The evidence tells us that pressure from black students was the driving force and the momentum shifted rapidly against him when a student went on a hunger strike on Nov. 2. However, anger had been growing since midOctober and a much larger number of people from across the university community joined the call for Wolfe to step down.

Final Rating: Half True  ","In 2002, Iran was more or less an American ally.","President Barack Obamas State of the Union address fueled an extended political pre-game show that almost rivaled the chatter ahead of the Super Bowl. Every network fielded experts to assess what the president might say, why he would say it, and what could happen next. On the afternoon of the speech, MSNBCs Andrea Mitchell was deep in conversation with MSNBC political director Chuck Todd and Washington Post political reporter Chris Cillizza. The three agreed that despite the hype, these speeches deliver few surprises. But Mitchell said in her mind, the great exception came in 2002 when President George W. Bush named Iran, North Korea and Iraq as part of an axis of evil. Up until that moment, Iran was cooperating with the United States on the border of Afghanistan, Mitchell, MSNBC's chief foreign affairs correspondent, said. Post 9/11, Iran was more or less an American ally. By being included in the axis of evil, it turned the Iranian government in a completely different direction. It was a turning point in American politics and in foreign policy. To say Iran and American ally in the same breath drew ridicule from the conservative community. The website Townhall.com wrote of Mitchells stunning historical ignorance. Breitbart.com called her claim a delusion. For this fact-check, we go to the record to assess whether in January 2002 Iran qualifies as more or less an American ally. A tortured relationship Ties between the U.S. and Iran have been troubled for over 50 years. With the help of the CIA and the British, a coup toppled Irans elected leader in 1953 and led to the autocratic control by the Shah, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi. An Islamic fundamentalist revolution displaced the Shah in 1979, producing the famous hostage crisis with American embassy staff. The U.S. has had no embassy in Iran since. Over the decades, there have been episodes when tensions between the two countries eased, but the dominant climate has been one of profound distrust if not outright hostility. The U.S. backed Iraqs Saddam Hussein in his war with Iran. Iran supported the Hezbollah in Lebanon as a military surrogate to strike at Israel. In recent years, the desire to shut down Irans nuclear program has defined American policy toward the Middle Eastern nation. With that background, it would come as a surprise to ever characterize Iran as anything approaching a partner of the United States. But if there was such a moment, it was immediately after the Sept. 11 attacks on American soil. The enemy of my enemy Iranian and American interests dovetailed in Afghanistan, which lies along Irans eastern border. Iran viewed the Taliban as a threat. For many, many years, the Iranians backed the Northern Alliance, the opponents to the Taliban, said Hossein Askari, a professor at George Washington Universitys Elliott School of International Affairs. The Northern Alliance became Americas wedge into Afghanistan in an offensive that overthrew the Taliban in a matter of weeks. Askari said Iran had boots on the ground in those attacks. Iran had its military advisers within the Northern Alliance forces, Askari said. I was told they fought side by side. To block a resurgent Taliban, both Iran and the U.S. wanted to establish a strong centralized government in Afghanistan. This required a partnership between two ethnic groups, the Tajik leaders of the Northern Alliance and the Pashtuns of Hamid Karzai. But the Northern Alliance was not interested. According to a RAND report prepared for U.S. Marine Corps, Iran brought the two sides together. Iranian political pressure on Northern Alliance leaders during negotiations in Bonn, Germany, persuaded them to reach a compromise and agree to the formation of the new government, the RAND report said. Soon after Sept. 11, Iran also helped the U.S. with al-Qaida. This also fit with Irans interests. Al-Qaida is on the other side of the religious divide that splits the Arab world. Al-Qaida is Sunni while Iran is Shia. Iran gave no harbor to members of the terrorist organization. They turned al-Qaida operatives out of their country, Askari said. A former Bush administration official told the Associated Press that Iran copied the passports of about 300 of those operatives and sent them to the United Nations where they were handed over to the Americans. Temporary partners, not allies While all of these moves put Iran and the U.S. on the same side, Askari would not goes as far as Mitchell suggested. I totally disagree that they were allies, Askari said. Their interests merged on this one issue, the Taliban and al-Qaida in Afghanistan. Iran wanted to have a say in what happened in Afghanistan. But on other issues, they kept their distance. As an historical note, Askari believes the Iranians became most interested in a new relationship with the U.S. only when American forces rapidly drove Saddam Hussein out of power. They were shaking in their boots, Askari said. They really thought that if the U.S. could do that to Saddam Hussein so quickly, they could be next. But whatever overtures Iran made at that moment were met with no response from the Bush administration. Our ruling Mitchell said that in 2002, Iran was almost an ally of the United States. While Iran provided critical assistance in the military defeat of the Taliban in Afghanistan and helped undermine al-Qaida, this cooperation did not reflect deeper ties. It was a moment when both countries sought similar goals in one country. Mitchells point was the Bush administration squandered an opportunity. That might have merit, but there is no fact-checking a hypothetical situation. What we can assess is the degree to which Iran was more or less an ally.",0.5,0.5,1.0,0.5,0.2,0.5,0.4,1.0,0.4,Half True

Final Rating: Half True  ","Ohio lost 400,000 jobs on his (Ted Stricklands) watch.","Like the refrain of a ubiquitous pop song, the phrase -- Ohio lost 400,000 jobs on his watch -- is playing over and over on the airwaves. And like any good lyric, the phrase is catchy.Republican U.S. Senate candidate Rob Portman sings it about his Democratic challenger Lee Fisher, who is Ohios lieutenant governor and former head of the states economic development department. Republican gubernatorial candidate John Kasich sings it about incumbent governor Ted Strickland.Now the Republican Governors Association has made the phrase the central theme of three commercials attacking Strickland on behalf of Kasich.Ohio lost 400,000 jobs on his watch, is the opening line for one of the ads.With the phrase getting aired so often, we thought it was time to check the accuracy of the playlist.The Republicans are referring to the states net job losses since Strickland -- and by extension Fisher -- took office in January 2007. Ohio lost 386,600 non-farm jobs from January 2007 through June of this year, the latest figure available. So Republicans are largely accurate when they say Ohio has lost 400,000 jobs since January of 2007. Job losses were as high as 438,900 at the end of February of this year.But the claim breaks down when Republicans suggest that the governor -- or any one official -- is responsible for the job losses.Ohio has been losing jobs since January of 2000 - 568,300 according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Of those, 403,800 came in the manufacturing sector. Its also worth noting, since campaigns are trying to blame those in charge when the state lost jobs, that Republicans held the governors office seven of those years and held both houses of the legislatures until January 2009. Republican George W. Bush was president for eight of those years.Strickland argues that Ohio - like Michigan and other Midwest states -- was especially hurt by forces beyond his control, namely a recession and the decline of manufacturing. Ohio and the nation have suffered through two recessions, one that started in 2001 and one that started in 2008, which triggered an avalanche of job losses here and was considered a global economic crisis.Strickland is not the only one making this argument.Indiana Gov. Mitch Daniels, a Republican elected in 2004 who is in his second term, says the same thing, at least he did July 22 during an interview in Cleveland. What makes the Daniels comments worth highlighting is that the rising GOP star was in town campaigning with Kasich. The two were beating up on Strickland for the states job losses.But Daniels became a bit defensive when questioned about Hoosier State less than stellar performance in the last several years. Indiana lost 174,000 net jobs since January of 2007 and the state has a current unemployment rate of 10.1 percentage points compared to Ohios 10.5 rate.In a time when every state that is not sitting on a pile of natural gas is struggling, you bet we are, Daniels said. He argued that Indiana is adding jobs faster than other states and its business climate is better than Ohios. But, echoing the sentiments of other governors in defense of their states economic woes, he said, To some extent, everybody is at the mercy of national and global events, and we are no different.Thats right. Daniels delivered the line that many Democrats make to defend themselves from the charge that the states job losses are all their fault.So even if the campaign phrase -- Ohio lost 400,000 jobs on his watch -- is stuck in a voters head, the claim does not reflect the larger economic backdrop, one that both Democrats and Republicans in charge of states admit produced results out of their control.If the roles were reversed, and Ohio were led by a Republican governor and it was Democrats making the accusation, our rating would be the same.We find the Republican Governors Association claim to be Half True.

Final Rating: Half True",Less than half of jobs at the Carrier manufacturing plant in Indiana are actually staying.,"Supporters of Donald Trump have praised the president-elect for working out a deal to keep jobs at a manufacturing plant in Indiana from being moved to Mexico. Appearing on NBCs Meet the Press Dec. 4, Vice President-elect Mike Pence said the deal with Carrier, which makes heating, air conditioning and refrigerator parts, meant more than a thousand Hoosiers have certainty in their jobs and in their futures going into this Christmas season because of the leadership of Donald Trump. Later in the show, pundits from the left and right raised concerns that painted the deal in a less twinkling light. National Review editor Rich Lowry said the government incentives involved were not ideal, and he doesnt like Trump threatening to retaliate against businesses with tariffs for moves he disapproves of. Heather McGhee, president of the left-leaning think tank Demos, said the number of saved jobs is overhyped. Did you actually read the Carrier letter? McGhee asked the panel. It started out saying we are pleased to inform you and ended up talking about all the jobs that would still be shipped overseas. The numbers I'm looking at say less than half of them are actually staying. With so many numbers in the mix, we decided to see if McGhees claim hadmerit. McGhee was talking about aletter related to1,400 Carrier jobs in Indianapolis. Most jobs, but far from every job,at the Indianapolis plant ended up being saved thanks to the deal with Trump's team. The outlook worsens when you factor in that plant's joblosses with another Indiana plant slated for closure and owned by Carrier's parent company. The making of a promise In February, United Technologies, the parent company for Carrier Corporations,announced it would be closing an Indianapolis Carrier plant and moving its 1,400 jobs to Monterrey, Mexico. Trump talked about the news throughout his campaign, using Carrier as an example of how trade deals like NAFTA have destroyed the manufacturing industry. We're not going to let Carrier leave, Trump said in Indiana, of which Pence is governor, in April. Because say what you want, Indiana. I've been talking about Carrier now for four months, right? About three weeks after the general election, Carrier confirmed talks with Trump and Pence but did not elaborate. Carrier has had discussions with the incoming administration and we look forward to working together. Nothing to announce at this time. Five days later, Trump tweeted that a deal had been struck, jobs had been saved, and his promise to Americans had been fulfilled. Big day on Thursday for Indiana and the great workers of that wonderful state.We will keep our companies and jobs in the U.S. Thanks Carrier We are pleased to have reached a deal with President-elect Trump & VP-elect Pence to keep close to 1,000 jobs in Indy. More details soon. The state of Indiana vowed to give the company $7 million in tax incentives over a decade, and the company agreed to invest $16 million in keeping the company in the state. While many workers celebrated saving their jobs, free-market capitalists balked, including Trump ally and Republican Sarah Palin, who described the deal as crony capitalism. Lost in the jubilation was that hundreds of jobs at the Carrier plant would not be spared from export. On top of that, Carrier's parent company, United Technologies, said it will continue with previously announced plans to close a factory in Huntington, Ind., and move its 700 jobs to Mexico. Behind the numbers So how does McGhees statement add up? The best numbers available can be reasonably examined a couple ways. We could not reach a spokesperson for United Technologies for comment Sunday, so we're going by reported estimates inthe Washington Post, New York Timesand the Wall Street Journal, among others. The first way to add up the number — which doesnt support McGhees point — is by looking just at Carrier jobs. Again, more than 1,400 Carrier jobs were heading to Mexico before the incoming administration intervened. Multiple reports put the number of saved jobs from that plantat 800 union workers, mainly those involved with buildingfurnaces. So thats more than half, or 57 percent, of the estimated 1,400 jobs that were slated to be lost from the Indianapolis plant. Thats a bit lower than the more than 1,000 jobs talking point weve heard from Pence, Trump and Carrier. According to CNNMoney, that total is inflated by factoring in 300 primarily administrative and engineering jobs held by parent company United Technologies that were not at risk of moving to Mexico. The letter that McGhee talked about on the show was sent to employees Dec. 1. Carrier said it would move forward with its earlier plan to relocate its fan coil manufacturing lines out of the country.  Breaking: Carrier confirms in letter to workers that fan coil jobs will relocate to Mexico by end of 2017. @rtv6 @IndyThisWeek pic.twitter.com/pcHo5ZPuh4 While this announcement is good news for many, we recognize it is not good news for everyone, reads the letter. We are moving forward with previously announced plans to relocate the fan coil manufacturing lines, with expected completion by the end of 2017. While the letter doesnt use specific numbers, news reports have said that the fan coil relocation will cost 600 U.S. jobs. And theres more to the story. The incoming administration was not able to work out a deal to prevent the closing of United Technologies'Huntington factory. So 700 of those jobs will be outsourced to Mexico. So between the U.S. job losses at the factories in Carrier andHuntington, approximately 1,300 jobs willbe moved to Mexico under theumbrella of United Technologies. Going by the broader view, McGhee is right that less than half (or 38 percent) of the 2,100 jobs in danger of being exported actually ended up staying. Our ruling McGhee said that less than half of the jobs from the Carrier deal actually stayed in the United States.  If you just count the number of jobs at the Carrier plant, which is what Trump promised to save and what McGhee referenced on the show, then her claim is not accurate. In fact, more than half of the jobs will stay in the United States because the deal is keeping approximately 800 jobs out of 1,400at the Carrier plant. However, herstatement is correct when applied more broadly to include jobs that will be lost from the United Technologies' factory closure in Huntington, as well as the hundreds of jobs not saved in the Carrier deal. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/228c9aa4-bea8-420d-b946-dd81fe8327f9",0.5,0.5,1,0.5,0,0,0.5,1,0.5,Half True

Final Rating: Half True  ",Cuba has a lung cancer vaccine we in the US had no access to because we sanctioned Cuba.,"Online supporters of Bernie Sanders came to his defense on the issue of Cuba, touting the communist island nations accomplishments beyond improving literacy rates. Cuba has a lung cancer vaccine we in the US had no access to because we sanctioned Cuba, the Feb. 24 post said. Cuba eliminated HIV transmission from mother to child. Cuba has a literacy rate of nearly 98% now. The post was flagged as part of Facebooks efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Well focus on the claim about the lung cancer vaccine because the facts behind the statement lead to a less certain conclusion than the Facebook post suggests. (The other elements in the post are accurate.) Though we tend to think of vaccines as protecting you from getting sick, cancer vaccines work differently. In 2016, nearly 150,000 people died from lung cancer in the United States. Neither the United States nor Cuba nor anyone else has developed a vaccine that would stop those deaths. Thats because cancer vaccines dont block disease; their purpose is to shrink existing tumors, and failing that, slow them down. There are 91 lung cancer vaccines under study today in the United States, according to the National Institutes of Health. During the 1990s, Cuba began testing a drug called Cimavax and found that it extended lung cancer patients lives by about three months. In 2011, Cuba began offering the drug to Cubans for free. That same year, Cuban researchers discussed the results with the Roswell Park Cancer Institute in Buffalo, N.Y. Four years later — the same year that the United States and Cuba re-opened embassies in each others capitals — scientists from both countries agreed on a collaborative research project. It was the first time since the Cuban revolution that Cuban and American institutions had been permitted to engage in such a joint venture, Roswell Parks chief executive, Candace S. Johnson told the New York Times. The initial results in Cuba were ambiguous, and they needed to be replicated in the United States to meet Food and Drug Administration rules. Ultimately, the Roswell Park study hopes to have 180 patients. These are people with advanced cancer who have exhausted other treatments. So far, the study has not met its goal. Approximately 100 people have gone to Cuba on their own for treatment. With about 200,000 new cases of lung cancer each year, the fraction of patients accessing Cimavax is about one tenth of one percent. When the Trump administration re-imposed restrictions on travel to Cuba, it created a legal bind for Americans — about 100 since 2016 — who have gone there for this treatment. According to the new rules, they were now breaking the law. But this highlights that opening the doors to Cuba also increased access to the drug, although access was limited to patients who could afford to make the trip. A Facebook post said Cuba had a lung cancer vaccine that the United States had no access to due to the decades-long embargo. There is an element of accuracy here, but it lacks several important pieces of information. A lung cancer vaccine doesnt prevent the disease; it is judged a success if it slows down or stops tumor growth. The drug in this case, Cimavax, extended life by about three months in the Cuban study. Access to Cimavax is limited to about 180 patients in one American study and those who go on their own to Cuba. The combined total represents a tiny fraction of people with lung cancer. There are about 90 cancer vaccines under study in America today. None of this would be apparent to people who read the Facebook post.",0.5,0.5,1,0.5,0,0.5,0.5,1,0.5,Half True

Final Rating: Half True",Says President Obama has cracked down on employers who are attracting undocumented immigrants and hiring them more than any previous president.,"President Barack Obama is the boss-buster in chief when it comes to going after employers who hire undocumented workers, according to U.S. Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, D-Fla. President Obama has the most border patrols and border security deployed at the border of any previous president, said Wasserman Schultz, in a June 20 interview on MSNBC. Obama has cracked down on employers who are attracting undocumented immigrants and hiring them more than any previous president. In a related fact-check, we gave Wasserman Schultz, who also serves as the Democratic National Committee chair, a Mostly True for her claim about border patrol and security. Here, we will explore if Obama holds the record for cracking down on employers who hire undocumented immigrants. Workplace raids vs. paperwork raids For some background, we turned to the Migration Policy Institute, a think tank that studies worldwide migration. Their 2013 paper about the history of immigration enforcement includes a chapter on workplace enforcement. We also found some background in a 2010 investigation from the Orange County Register. After multiple efforts, Congress passed the 1986 Immigration Reform and Control Act, which stated that employers couldnt knowingly hire unauthorized workers. Employers must attest that they made a good faith effort to verify the eligibility of workers by completing an I-9 form. The documents are easy to counterfeit, so the federal government developed an online employer verification system in the 1990s under President Bill Clinton, and the use of it soared after 2007. That system, now known as E-Verify, is currently voluntary, though some states mandate it for certain employers. (The Corker-Hoeven amendment to the Senate immigration bill would make it mandatory.) E-Verify spending dramatically increased under President George W. Bush and Obama. Still, immigration rules have proved difficult to enforce. As of 2010, about 8 million unauthorized immigrants worked in the United States. The federal governments worksite enforcement strategy has changed over time as well, making it difficult to compare data and declare any president the leader in cracking down on employers, experts across the political spectrum told us. At times, members in Congress have called for stiffer workplace enforcement. But when the reality hit home in their districts and led to complaints from business owners, politicians urged the federal government to ease up, according to border expert and University at Albany professor Rey Koslowski. Thats why border security has been more politically popular to fund than worksite enforcement. (We should note that a significant percentage of people working illegally don't cross the border; they simply overstay their visas.) Doris Meissner, the Immigration and Naturalization Service commissioner Clinton, called worksite enforcement a bit of a third rail. (She is one of the authors of the Migration Policy Institute paper. The Immigration and Naturalization Service is now called Immigration and Customs Enforcement, known as ICE.) Under Bush, workplace raids on factories and meatpacking plants received much attention. But after Obama took office, the Department of Homeland Security unveiled a new strategy and ditched the workplace raids, which also tended to punish employees, in favor of paper raids -- I-9 paperwork audits of employers to determine if they complied with employment eligibility verification laws. ICE will focus its resources within the worksite enforcement program on the criminal prosecution of employers who knowingly hire illegal workers in order to target the root cause of illegal immigration, Homeland Security chief Janet Napolitano said in April 2009. The change was dramatic: the number of I-9 audits soared from 503 in 2008 to more than 8,000 in 2009. Under Obama, ICE announced sanctions against major employers. That included a $1 million fine gainst Abercrombie and Fitch that grew out of an I-9 inspection in November 2008 while Bush was president, and the termination of hundreds of workers at Chipotle restaurants. In 2007, ICE arrested 92 employers, while in 2012 it arrested 240, according to ICE. Final orders -- rulings at the end of the case which show employers violated hiring rules -- also increased under Obama. In 2007, there were two final orders, while in 2012 there were 495. But Obama doesnt hold a record on final orders against employers. The numbers of final orders hit higher numbers in the 1990s. Those 495 final orders under Obama were consistently exceeded between 1992 and 1998, with a peak 1,063 final orders in 1992, according to data from the governments Immigration Statistics yearbook. Wasserman Schultz spokesman Jonathan Beeton sent us news reports showing an increase in I-9 audits and fines under Obama compared to Bush. (We were unable to obtain I-9 audit statistics from the 1990s, so we dont know if Obama holds the record merely over Bush.) Still, I-9 audits arent the only way to measure immigration enforcement. While audits have soared under Obama, other metrics have fallen, including arrests of employees, said Jessica Vaughan, director of policy studies at the Center for Immigration Studies, which favors restricting immigration. Thats not a surprise, since Obama turned the focus away from the workers and toward employers. However, by ignoring the workers, they are choosing to cut off a line of inquiry to nail employers, Vaughan told PolitiFact in an interview. We asked Vaughan if she thinks Wasserman Schultz was correct to state that Obama holds the record on enforcement of employers. It depends on which metric you choose, she said. If your metric is the number of audits, yes. If your metric is bringing cases to prosecution that seriously punish employers, to the point where I would say there would be a deterrent effect, I would strongly disagree with her statement. Additionally, I-9 audits are not a complete or perfect measurement of worksite enforcement against employers who hired illegal workers, said former U.S. Rep. Bruce Morrison, D-Conn., who chaired the immigration subcommittee from 1989 to 1991. Morrison now lobbies on immigration matters and has informally advised hospitals and other businesses that have faced I-9 audits. He described some of the I-9 audits as paperwork snafus -- for example an employer who didnt check the right box. If there are no illegals, you are more likely to be cut a break on penalties than if you hired a lot of illegals, but you get fined anyhow... he said. Trying to say who is being tougher on this aspect of enforcement I think is kind of a silly discussion, because what were people fined for? And did that help prevent unauthorized employment or not? We also interviewed Carl Hampe, an attorney at Baker McKenzie who has represented employees in immigration cases since the 1990s and was an attorney for the Senate committee that drafted the 1986 law. Hampe said that Wasserman Schultzs claim is not inaccurate, but given the changing enforcement strategies, its not quite that black and white. In the 1990s, INS handled a higher number of civil cases, while Bush focused on criminal investigations against employers and workers. Obama has pursued civil audits and criminal investigations against employers. Its hard to say whether Bush 43 or (Obama) is the hands-down winner, he said. Our ruling Wasserman Schultz said that Obama has cracked down on employers who are attracting undocumented immigrants and hiring them more than any previous president. She used the word employers and not employees here for a reason: Obama shifted away from Bushs strategy of workplace raids and turned the focus on employers. Between 2008 and 2009, immigration audits soared from 503 to more than 8,000. But other metric tell a more nuanced story. Final orders against employers, for example, were higher in the 1990s than they are now.",0.5,0.5,1,0.5,0,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,Half True

Final Rating: True  ","Says Kelly Loeffler welcomed the support of a QAnon conspiracy theorist, and she sat down with a white supremacist for an interview.","In a Georgia debate that could help decide which party controls the Senate, Black pastor Raphael Warnock went after white businesswoman Kelly Loeffler on race. And she says she is against racism and that racism has no place, Warnock, the Democratic challenger, said of Loeffler, the GOP senator. But she welcomed the support of a QAnon conspiracy theorist, and she sat down with a white supremacist for an interview. I don't think she can explain that. Warnock was referring to Georgia Republican Marjorie Taylor Greene, a supporter of the baseless QAnon conspiracy theory, and conservative activist Jack Posobiec, who once interviewed Loeffler. Warnock, pastor of the Atlanta church once led by Martin Luther King Jr., has repeatedly made the claim against Loeffler. In the debate, Loeffler didnt respond directly to the two-part attack, but said: Theres not a racist bone in my body. Loeffler did embrace an endorsement from Greene in a campaign event, so that part is true. The evidence Warnock relies on for the other part of the claim doesnt flatly label Posobiec as a white supremacist, but notes that he has ties to people in that movement, and Posobiec and has praised some of them. The QAnon conspiracy theory claims public figures like Hillary Clinton, Tom Hanks and Oprah Winfrey are part of a ring of Satan-worshipping, cannibalistic pedophiles, and that President Donald Trump is secretly fighting to bring it down. The FBI has described the QAnon movement as a potential domestic terrorism threat. But Greene, a former construction executive heading to Congress, has called it a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to take this global cabal of Satan-worshiping pedophiles out, and has made derogatory remarks about Black people, Jews and Muslims. Loeffler appeared with Greene at an Oct. 15 campaign event to tout her endorsement from the House candidate. By then, Greene had won a primary runoff to represent Georgias safely Republican 14th congressional district. Loeffler praised Greenes defense of conservative values. I've gotten a lot of work done in Washington already in that regard — and I'm thrilled to know I've got a strong, conservative champion that's going to be fighting right alongside with me, Loeffler said of Greene. In the Nov. 3 election, Greene won easily, becoming the first open supporter of QAnon to win a seat in the U.S. House. Loeffler gave an interview July 31 to Posobiec, who is known as a conservative activist and is a correspondent for One America News Network, a conservative cable news channel. Loeffler highlighted the interview, which aired on OANN, on her campaigns Twitter account. She said she did the interview to discuss why I had to call out theBlack Lives Matter political organization — and why the woke mob is trying to cancel me. To back its claim about Loeffler sitting for an interview with a white supremacist, Warnocks campaign cited a news report about Posobiec from the Atlanta Journal-Constitution and a report about Posobiec from the Southern Poverty Law Center, a social justice nonprofit that in recent years has been criticized over some of its tracking of hate groups. Those reports talk about Posobiecs association with white supremacy. The Atlanta Journal-Constitution led its article about the Loeffler interview by saying Posobiec is associated with white supremacy and Nazism. The article said Jewish groups and media observers pointed out that Posobiec promotes conspiracy theories and once associated with white supremacists including Richard Spencer. Posobiec has praised Spencer, a white nationalist who was one of the leaders of the August 2017 Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, where a white supremacist rammed a car into a counterprotester, killing her. The Southern Poverty Law Center, in a report published July 8 on its Hatewatch blog, said Posobiec collaborated for years with white supremacists, including Spencer. Posobiecs ties to far-right extremists travel beyond borders into Europe. His connections to white supremacy are too numerous to compile into one article, so Hatewatch is running a series of stories on the correspondents ties to the movement and promotion of it. The center does not include Posobiec on its list of white nationalists, or its broader list of extremists. The only reason we have not formally listed Posobiec yet is that we are still reporting out his history within hate movements, Michael Edison Hayden, who wrote the Hatewatch blog post on Posobiec, told PolitiFact. We have more to publish about Posobiec soon, also related to promotion of an anti-immigrant politician and his collaboration with white supremacists. Do not interpret the current absence of his extremist profile as a suggestion that he is somehow less extreme than figures like Richard Spencer. Brian Levin, director of the Center for the Study of Hate & Extremism at California State University, San Bernardino, said Posobiec has apparently cozied up to various white supremacists. Loeffler should know that granting an interview to such a person, while criticizing those who point out his bigotry and disturbing associations, legitimizes the toxic views he so dutifully promotes. Loefflers campaign and Posobiec did not respond to our requests for comment. Warnock said Loeffler welcomed the support of a QAnon conspiracy theorist, and she sat down with a white supremacist for an interview. Loeffler did welcome the endorsement of her campaign by a QAnon supporter. Loeffler gave an interview to a man who has praised a prominent white nationalist and who, according to the Southern Poverty Law Center, collaborated for years with white supremacists. The center does not include the interviewer on its list of white nationalists, but says it is continuing to investigate him.

So I had a very successful term.The Carter Center uses his success rating (batting average) from Congressional Quarterly, a leading authority on Congress. They calculate percentage of votes that go a president's way during his term. It's also based on a University of Virginia essay on his presidency.But wasn't Carter famously at odds with Congress? How could he possibly have been successful?We looked at Carter's White House Diary, where he elaborated more carefully on his track record in commentary accompanying Carter's April 19, 1977, entry:Despite the controversial and often unpopular nature of my proposals to the Congress, I had remarkably good success in congressional approval of bills I supported. The Congressional Quarterly reported that since 1953 Lyndon Johnson, John Kennedy and I ranked in that order in obtaining approval of legislation proposed to Congress. The Miller Center reported that my record exceeded Kennedy's.CQ Almanac publishes vote studies each year that determine how often the president took a clear position on a vote in Congress, and how often they went his way.The almanac lists success rates by term of Presidents Dwight D. Eisenhower through George W. Bush. If you average those rates for each president, Carter is third. He got his way 76.6 percent of the time. That's right behind Kennedy at 84.6 and Johnson at 82.2.That seems simple enough, but things get complicated from there.We also looked at the Miller Center of Public Affairs' website, which he cited for saying he was second only to Johnson. The book's afterword quoted the site directly:Carter gained a reputation for political ineptitude, even though his actual record in dealing with Congress belied that image. His success rate in getting presidential initiatives through Congress was much higher than that of Bush [...] Carter was also close to Johnson's success rates, and higher than Kennedy's record.The problem is that the website has since been revised since the book was published. Carter's CQ scores contradict it, so it was changed to avoid confusion, a Miller Center spokeswoman said.The Miller Center's assessment that Carter's congressional record is much better than it is perceived still stands, the spokeswoman emphasized.  We located no study that found Carter was second only to Johnson. Still, even if he's third behind Kennedy, who did not serve a full term, the change does not make that big of a difference, said Steven H. Hochman, director of research at the Carter Center.The difference was just Kennedy. Was he before or behind Kennedy? And it's not too much of a difference, Hochman said.Now for the tough part. There are many ways to assess a president's legislative success. Scholars think CQ's measure is helpful, but it does not take into account whether the president manages to turn his proposals into law. For instance, a tax package might pass the Senate but fail in the House. CQ would count the Senate vote as a success even though the overall effort failed.Furthermore, it may not be fair to compare the average of a two-term president with Carter's single term, one scholar noted. Second-term scores tend to be lower and drag a president's overall average down. If you compare first terms only, Carter drops to fourth behind Dwight D. Eisenhower. And if you look at how many of Carter's initiatives actually were enacted, his record is unexceptional. According to an analysis by Andrew Rudalevige, a political science professor at Dickinson College in Carlisle, Pa., who has studied presidential legislative successes, only 44 percent of his initiatives became law. This puts him behind Johnson, Bill Clinton, Eisenhower, George H.W. Bush and Kennedy, in that order. (Eisenhower and George H.W. Bush are tied.) Plus, if you compare Carter to other presidents who served while their parties controlled both the House and Senate, he's at or near the bottom, according to another analysis published in 1990. Still, Carter won nearly 70 percent of his contested and important votes, according to CQ numbers cited in Rudalevige's analysis. Other problems with the CQ score are that it doesn't measure whether a president's proposal was watered down, or take into account whether he worked under unusually hostile conditions.And Carter did push an ambitious agenda during a very difficult time, experts agreed. His proposals included reforms on health care, welfare and energy, topics that remain difficult today.Furthermore, the Democratic Party was deeply divided during Carter's administration. Reforms in the House of Representatives dispersed power more widely among its members, making it difficult to influence the body as a whole.Even Johnson, who is renowned for his legislative skill, would have struggled under those conditions, notes Mark A. Peterson, a professor at the University of California Los Angeles who has written extensively on presidential legislative successes.Yes, by one measure Carter did very well legislatively, but not quite as well as he has claimed, Peterson said. He didn't do well compared to other presidents whose parties had majorities in both houses of Congress, but considering his party's divisions, his achievements are notable, he added.And by another measure that really matters -- actually enacting legislation -- Carter fared quite poorly, with the recognition that he tried to push a bold, difficult agenda, Peterson said.Overall, though, experts we interviewed said Carter's legislative record exceeds its reputation.It's somewhat of a mixed case, but it is more successful than most people think, Rudalevige said.Consider his victory on the 1978 Panama Canal treaties, noted George C. Edwards III, a professor of political science at Texas A&M University who has written about Carter's legislative record. In 1976, almost half of the Senate pledged they would vote against altering the existing arrangement. Carter managed to get the two-thirds vote needed to change it in 1978.Now, what do we make of all this?We found no evidence that Carter's record surpassed every president since Eisenhower's but Johnson's, but according to one measure, he was close.A broader look at Carter's legislative record showed it was mixed. In at least one case, the Panama Canal treaties, his achievement was exceptional.Yet while his proposals garnered favorable votes in one chamber, many never became law. It's hard to call that a true record of legislative success.Still, he did better than most people think.AJC PolitiFact Georgia defines Half True as an accurate statement that leaves out important details or take things out of context.",0.7,0.6,0.9,0.7,0.2,0.5,0.4,0.8,0.6,Half True

Final Rating: Half True  ","Research found that over the course of the existence of the Brady Bill ban, the use of assault weapons in crimes decreased by two thirds.","Coming off his emotional congressional testimony backing legislation to renew a ban on military-style assault weapons, Milwaukee Police Chief Ed Flynn appeared on MSNBC.Asked about criticism alleging that the previous ban had almost no impact on the nations homicide rate, Flynn cited studies on the ban done for the U.S. Department of Justice.Researchers, said Flynn, found that over the course of the existence of the Brady Bill ban, the use of assault weapons in crimes decreased by two-thirds. He added: Now, they couldnt prove causation. Police implemented and embraced a wide variety of strategies and tactics during those 10 years as well. But its foolish not to see that there was a correlation. And to demand perfect social science causation proof before we can say that something had an impact on a phenomenon is foolish, its rhetorical and it doesnt relate to the reality of policing.As Congress debates tightening gun controls after the Newtown school massacre, we thought it was worth checking Flynns assertion about assault-weapon use during the ban that began in 1994 and expired in 2004.Did a study show a two-thirds drop off in use of assault weapons in crimes?The claim is in wide circulation, having found its way into talking points that U.S. Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-California) offers for the renewal of the assault weapons ban. The National Rifle Association, which is fighting the ban, disputes the number.At issue is a 2004 study, sponsored by the National Institute of Justice, an arm of the U.S. Justice Department. Its author, Christopher S. Koper, also did the federally sponsored report for Congress on the short term (1994-1996) effect of the ban.Koper is a veteran criminology researcher, formerly of the Police Executive Research Forum. At the time of the 2004 study he was a professor affiliated with the Jerry Lee Center of Criminology at the University of Pennsylvania. He is now at the Center for Evidence-Based Crime Policy at George Mason University.The 1994 ban was aimed at semiautomatics, including rifles and pistols, with features that appear useful in military and criminal applications but unnecessary in shooting sports or self-defense (examples include flash hiders, folding rifle stocks, and threaded barrels for attaching silencers), the study said.Flynn and Feinstein point to a conclusion in Kopers 2004 report that found a big decline in the percentage of assault weapons among the guns seized by law enforcement and sent to federal officials for tracing.That percentage dropped by 70 percent between 1992-03 and 2001-02. That is, the percentage went from 5.4 percent to 1.6 percent of guns seized, the study found. The percentages are low because the guns are rarely used in gun crimes.That 70 percent drop is the main evidence for the two-thirds claim.Theres another piece of data from Kopers study that suggests such a major decline. Its the experience in Boston pre-ban (1991 to 1993) and post-ban (2000 to 2002). There, police saw a 72 percent drop in assault weapons among all guns recovered by police.Lets take a closer look at both.The overriding point is that we found consistent evidence across multiple national and local data sources that the use of (assault weapons) declined substantially during the ban years, Koper said in an email to PolitiFact Wisconsin. The apparent drop was mainly in assault pistols, not assault rifles.In addition, Koper wrote, based on figures collected in six metro police department there were indications in the data that (assault weapons) were becoming increasingly rare over time.Koper, however, made clear that he did not try to come up with one definitive number that illustrated the decline in assault weapons seen in the data.A reading of the study shows why. It cautions in great detail that data that shows a 70 percent decline nationally is not conclusive.First, a large majority of guns recovered by police are not sent to federal authorities who trace the gun from its manufacture to sale. So those guns may not be representative of the types of firearms seized by police, the study noted.In addition, the drop may be attributable in large part to changes in tracing practices, the study noted.Still, Koper noted in the 2004 study that the dramatic decline started in the year of the ban.Ultimately, he concluded that the trace data suggest an actual decline in use of assault weapons in crimes.Koper told us the national tracing data may overstate the drop, but it's understandable that people cite that number since it's a national figure.He added: At any rate, there are lots of subtleties in this and no one right answer.The National Rifle Association critique of the Flynn-Feinstein claim is that traces are not synonymous with crimes.The study acknowledges that, but cites a variety of reasons why guns recovered by police should serve as a good approximation of the types of guns used in violent crime, even though many are not clearly linked to such crimes.When we asked Flynn about this, Police Inspector WilliamJessupwrote back saying: While there are limitations with any type of data, Chief Flynn does consider the 70 percent drop in ATF traces on assault weapons to be a reasonable proxy for the level of crime involving assault weapons during that period.Local findingsKoper told us that people who refer to a two-thirds drop might also be referring to the studys finding of a 72 percent reduction in assault weapon use in Boston based on police data about crime guns there.Other metro areas in the study also saw a decline, but only Bostons dropoff was in the two-thirds range.Milwaukee County was in the study. Data collected here -- just on guns used in homicides -- showed a 17 percent drop from 1995 to 1998 compared to before the ban.That was the smallest reduction among weapon trends studied in Baltimore, Boston, Miami-Dade, St. Louis, Milwaukee and Anchorage. The reductions generally were between 32 and 40 percent, the study said.The Koper study concluded by finding mixed success at reducing criminal use of banned guns -- as well as ammunition feeding devices known as large capacity magazines.The decline suggested by the national trace data and the experience in several cities was offset throughout at least the late 1990s by steady or rising use of other guns equipped with large capacity magazines, based on data studied in Baltimore, Milwaukee, Louisville, and Anchorage, the study found. There was an immense stock of exempted pre-ban magazines and it grew as more imports came in, it noted.Bottom line, the study said, was that because the ban has not yet reduced the use of (large capacity magazines) in crime, we cannot clearly credit the ban with any of the nations recent drop in gun violence. The bans exemption of millions of pre-ban weapons and magazines ensured gradual effects that are still unfolding and may not be fully felt for several years into the future, the study found.Our ratingIn a cable TV appearance, Flynn said researchers had found that over the course of the existence of the Brady Bill ban, the use of assault weapons in crimes decreased by two thirds.Flynn accurately quotes the 70 percent figure from an oft-cited study by a veteran researcher for the U.S. Department of Justice. The study makes no claim that the ban caused the apparent decline, but neither does Flynn.Flynns claim suffers somewhat, though, from an excess of certainty. The study and its author offer numerous and serious cautions that make clear the 70 percent figure -- while suggestive of a major drop -- is not a definitive figure. And the study makes clear that not all weapons traced by authorities are, as Flynns statement implied, used in crimes.Those are important details that were missing.",0.7,0.5,1.0,0.6,0.0,0.4,0.5,1.0,0.5,Half True

Final Rating: Mostly False  ",Most of these mass shootings take place in (areas) where you're not allowed to have a concealed weapons permit.,"In the wake of mass shootings at the Pulse night club in Orlando and at the Fort Lauderdale airport, Florida lawmakers are expected to act on a series of bills to expand where people can carry their guns. The bills would allow concealed-carry permit holders to carry their guns in places such as airports, schools, college campuses, police stations and polling places. Florida leads the nation in conceal-carry permits with more than 1.7 million permits. Republican House Speaker Richard Corcoran supports expanding the list of where permit holders can carry their guns, possibly as a way to avert future attacks. (So does President Donald Trump, who promised to get rid of gun-free zones in schools and military bases.) Most of these mass shootings take place in arenas where you're not allowed to have a concealed weapons permit, he told CBS4 Miamis Jim DeFede on Feb. 12. (By arenas Corcoran seemed to be referring to places in general, not sports arenas.) Corcoran argued that people who commit mass shootings say they chose certain areas because they knew nobody had guns. That raises an interesting question, but its separate from the focus of this fact-check: whether most mass shootings happen in places where concealed carry permits dont apply, or gun-free zones.  Corcoran was citing research from a pro-gun advocate who reached that conclusion. But anti-gun advocates have argued that the data isnt so clear cut; they see other patterns in the statistical evidence. Overall, the evidence remains murky and depends on how researchers define gun-free or mass shooting.  Varying definitions of mass shootings Corcorans spokesman said he was referring to the numbers of mass public shootings compiled by economist John Lott, president of the pro-gun Crime Prevention Research Center. Lotts research has been quoted by those who support expanding gun rights, but academics often attack his research as flawed. His book More Guns, Less Crime has been a subject of ongoing academic and policy debates as well numerous fact-checks. His book argues that crime data over multiple years shows reductions in crime in states that have right to carry laws. But many other academics have said his work doesnt account for other factors that influence crime rates, and that he manipulates the data to reach his conclusions. The National Academies of Sciences concluded in 2005 that no link between right-to-carry laws and changes in crime is apparent in the raw data. Before we delve into the numbers compiled by Lott, we will explain why its complicated to make sweeping claims of mass shootings in gun-free zones. There is not an agreed-upon definition of what constitutes a mass shooting -- even the federal government has cited various criteria at times. FBI spokesman Stephen Fischer pointed to a 2012 law setting the threshold for a mass killing as three or more people killed, but another report by the federal Congressional Research Service says that mass murder has been defined generally as a threshold of four or more deaths. Lott points to the types of shootings the FBI included in this study of active shooter situations, but that study clearly says it isnt covering all mass shootings. Lott said he included mass shootings in which four or more were killed that occurred in public, and he excluded those that occurred within the commission of another crime such as an armed robbery. Lotts data showed that between 1988 and 2015, about 3.8 percent of mass shootings occurred in areas where guns were allowed. Everytown for Gun Safety found that among 133 mass shootings betweenJanuary 2009 and July 2015, 70 percent took place in private homes while 13 percent took place in gun-free zones, where carrying of concealed guns were prohibited. Another 17 percent took place in public areas where the carrying of firearms are allowed. Daniel Webster,the director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Policy and Research, who has disagreed with Lotts findings, pointed to research by Louis Klarevas, a professor at the University of Massachusetts-Boston. In Klarevas book Rampage Nation, he said that Lott has used too loose a concept of gun-free zones. Klarevas disagrees with gun advocates who define a gun-free zone as simply an area that bans private citizens from carrying a gun.  For example, Lott characterized Fort Hood and Washington Navy Yard, military sites attacked by gunmen, as gun-free despite the presence of armed security. Theres an obvious logical problem with such a conceptualization: How can a place be a gun-free zone if guns are present? Klarevas writes. The implication is that rampage shooters are only deterred by armed civilians, not by armed guards and cops. But thats an absurd suggestion. Klarevas uses three definitions: he refers to gun-free zones as places where civilians are not allowed to carry guns, and there arent armed personnel stationed on the property. He calls gun-restricting zones as places where civilians cant carry guns, yet armed security is routinely present -- such as military facilities or certain college campuses. He refers to places that allow civilians to carry guns as gun-allowing zones. Using these categories, Klarevas examined 111 shootings since 1966 in which six or more people had been killed in each incident -- regardless of whether it occurred in a public or private location or if it was in the commission of another crime. He found 13 took place in gun-free zones and five took place in gun-restricting zones. That means that the majority occurred in areas where there was no evidence that private guns were prohibited. Since Klarevas includes mass shootings in private residences or during the commission of another crime, that means that he counts several additional incidents that arent factored in by Lott. For example, as a mass shooting in a gun-allowing zone, Klarevas counts a gunfight between two rival biker gangs in Waco,Texas, in 2015 that left nine people dead. So thats an example of a shooting that wasnt in a gun-free zone that is omitted from Lotts calculations. The two also disagree on how to characterize whether guns were allowed at certain locations. Lott says that the shooting at Umpqua Community College in Oregon was in a gun-free zone and points to a school policy that bans possession of firearms except as expressly authorized by law or college regulations. Umpqua Community College spokeswoman Anne Marie Levis previously told PolitiFact Florida the schools gun-free policy didnt apply to students with a valid permit. UCC was never designated as a gun-free zone by any signage or policy, she said. Umpqua Community College does comply with state law by allowing students with concealed carry licenses to bring firearms on campus. Our ruling Corcoran said, Most of these mass shootings take place in arenas where you're not allowed to have a concealed weapons permit. Corcoran cites research by an advocate for gun rights who used a strict definition to define places where guns were not allowed. In reality, there are places where concealed weapons are permitted, places where police or security officers openly carry weapons, and places where concealed weapons are not permitted. Additionally, there are different ways to define mass shootings. We found that advocates for more gun control analyzed the data and reached different conclusions. Our assessment is that it is difficult to draw broad conclusions about the motivations of the perpetrators of mass shootings or whether they are influenced by gun restrictions. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/3a9f4fdc-aed8-4f53-9794-18cf41d2bea7",0.5,0.7,0.9,0.4,0.2,0.6,0.5,0.8,0.6,Mostly False

Final Rating: Half True  ","In 2018, the providers the state paid through the ACO reduced the amount of money spent on healthcare services by $7.7 million.","Clarification: This article has been revised from its original posting, after Gov. Phil Scotts office reached out with additional information clarifying his statement as focusing on the Medicaid patient pool. This made the statement more accurate — we changed the ruling from mostly false to half true — but Scott still left out important context about overall costs associated with the OneCare program. Gov. Phil Scott trumpeted the successes of Vermonts health care reform efforts in his budget address last month. There are compelling stories to be told, and accountable care is showing more potential than any other health care reform I can remember, he said of OneCare Vermont, the states accountable care organization. In 2018, the providers the state paid through the ACO reduced the amount of money spent on healthcare services by $7.7 million, Scott said. That savings figure jumped out at us. Our research on OneCare has found mixed results — and an open admission from health care officials that the program has not yet created the savings they hope to achieve. Did we miss something? We asked Scotts office for evidence and were referred to Ena Backus, director of health care reform for the state. She cited a Department of Vermont Health Access report on 2018 results for Medicaid patients. The $7.7 million in savings came from a small portion of Vermonts nearly 200,000 Medicaid patients. About 42,000 of those Vermonters participate in OneCare, said Alicia Cooper, director of payment reform for the department. An even smaller portion of those patients see doctors who are paid a set fee each month, rather than payments for each procedure. And its that subset of patients — those participating in OneCare whose doctors are paid a monthly fee — who cost the state $7.7 million less to care for than was originally expected, according to Backus. That point that was made [by Scott] demonstrates that there was a change in provider behavior that we can measure, Backus said. Ethan Latour, a spokesperson for Scott, further clarified this point in an email to VTDigger. Those words, STATE and THROUGH THE ACO, explicitly describe the population, he wrote. The problem? Scott referred in his speech to the amount of money spent on health care services. First off, his statement implies that there were savings in the entire health care system — not just a small piece of it. Secondly, the $7.7 million wasn't returned to taxpayers. Under the new model, OneCare Vermont and hospitals keep the savings, as a reward for keeping patients healthy. OneCare actually spent more money than expected —about $1.5 million —on all medical care for state Medicaid patients in 2018, if you factor in the doctors who charged traditional fee per procedure rates. Scott also didnt mention that Vermont taxpayers paid OneCare $11.7 million for administrative costs that year. OneCare collects money from Medicaid, Medicare and commercial insurance and then distributes it as a flat monthly payment for patient care. The administrative costs and incentives paid by the state cannot be entirely divorced from savings created by the program. In addition, the governor cited savings in the Medicaid program but across the OneCare there were no net decreases in spending after administrative costs and incentives for providers. Scotts assessment led him to urge the Legislature to grant OneCare $5.7 million in additional Medicaid monies during the state budget adjustment process -- on the condition the accountable care organization applies for nonprofit status or meets equivalent transparency standards. The real problem, Scott said, is OneCares ineffective public relations effort. In his budget speech, the governor invoked the states head regulator, Green Mountain Care Board chair Kevin Mullin, who in November urged the organization to tell a better story. I understand the ACO hasnt done a great job explaining how theyre improving peoples health and reducing costs, Scott said. But there are compelling stories to be told. Cooper, from the Department of Vermont Health Access, said Scotts $7.7 million assertion may be one of those stories. At Medicaid, were encouraged by these early results, she said. Thats enough to warrant continued testing of the model. Scott said, in 2018, the providers the state paid through the ACO reduced the amount of money spent on healthcare services by $7.7 million. That statement is partially accurate, but it does not account for the administrative costs or financial incentives paid by the state. Politifacts guidance describes half true as: The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context. Scotts claim ignores important facts about the cost of OneCare that would lead his audience to draw a different conclusion about the program's financial performance — even for the specific patient population that he references in his statement. ​",0.5,0.5,1,0.5,0,0.5,0.5,1,0.5,Half True

Final Rating: Half True  ",Says President Obama waited two weeks to call the attack in Libya terror.,"For weeks, Republicans have been hammering the Obama administration for allegedly concealing the true nature of the attack in Libya that claimed the life of the U.S. ambassador and three other Americans. During the second presidential debate, Mitt Romney charged that it took the president 14 days before he called the attack in Benghazi an act of terror.Obama had bristled at the idea that his administration had played politics with the attack. He called the suggestion offensive. Obama: The day after the attack, governor, I stood in the Rose Garden and I told the American people in the world that we are going to find out exactly what happened -- that this was an act of terror -- and I also said that we're going to hunt down those who committed this crime.Romney: I think interesting the president just said something, which is that on the day after the attack he went into the Rose Garden and said that this was an act of terror.Obama: That's what I said.Romney: You said in the Rose Garden the day after the attack, it was an act of terror. It was not a spontaneous demonstration, is that what you're saying?Obama: Please proceed, governor.Romney: I want to make sure we get that for the record because it took the president 14 days before he called the attack in Benghazi an act of terror.Obama: Get the transcript.We went to the transcript, and the president has a point. On September 12, the day after the attack, in the Rose Garden, Obama condemned the attack and said, No acts of terror will ever shake the resolve of this great nation. In the days since, some have parsed Obama's remarks and argued he didn't say the Benghazi attack was specifically an act of terror. However, given the overall context of his comments, it seems a fair conclusion that he was including the attack in the acts of terror that he said would never shake American resolve.However, in the days that followed, the White House spokesman and the U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations suggested that the attack seemed to have taken advantage of a demonstration over an American-made video that disparaged Islam.On Sept. 13, White House spokesman Jay Carney said, The protests we're seeing around the region are in reaction to this movie. They are not directly in reaction to any policy of the United States or the government of the United States or the people of the United States.The next day, a State Department spokeswoman said, We are very cautious about drawing any conclusions with regard to who the perpetrators were, what their motivations were, whether it was premeditated. But she ended with this: Obviously, there are plenty of people around the region citing this disgusting video as something that has been motivating.On Sept. 16, five days after the attack, Susan Rice, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations said, We do not have information at present that leads us to conclude that this was premeditated or preplanned.On Sept. 20, Carney told reporters, It is, I think, self-evident that what happened in Benghazi was a terrorist attack. Our embassy was attacked violently, and the result was four deaths of American officials.But that same day, Obama told an audience at a town hall meeting, What we do know is that the natural protests that arose because of the outrage over the video were used as an excuse by extremists to see if they can also directly harm U.S. interests.It wasnt until Sept. 21 that everyone in the administration as a whole stated publicly that the attack was planned and executed by a terrorist group.Our rulingRomney said it took the president 14 days before he called the Libya attack terror.In fact, Obama described it in those terms the day after the attack. But in the days that followed, neither he nor all the members of his administration spoke consistently on the subject. There were many suggestions that the attack was part of demonstrations over an American-made video that disparaged Islam. Update: After we published this item, we heard from readers that the president called the attack an act of terror two more times -- on Sept. 13 in Colorado and Sept. 14 in Nevada.As for the ones we lost last night: I want to assure you, we will bring their killers to justice, Obama said at a campaign event in Nevada. And we want to send a message all around the world -- anybody who would do us harm: No act of terror will dim the light of the values that we proudly shine on the rest of the world, and no act of violence will shake the resolve of the United States of America.So as we noted in our original item, Romney is off the mark as it relates to the word terror. But Obama contributed to the administration's mixed message when he spoke at the Univision Town Hall event on Sept. 20. A questioner asked: We have reports that the White House said today that the attacks in Libya were a terrorist attack. Do you have information indicating that it was Iran, or al Qaeda was behind organizing the protests?Here is Obamas reply:Well, were still doing an investigation, and there are going to be different circumstances in different countries. And so I dont want to speak to something until we have all the information. What we do know is that the natural protests that arose because of the outrage over the video were used as an excuse by extremists to see if they can also directly harm U.S. interests.So although Obama acknowledged the uncertainty, he emphasized the inflammatory video and the protest as contributing factors in the attack.By mentioning the video, Obama drew attention away from the possibility that the attack had been a planned assault. This lies at the heart of the dispute over what Obama and his administration were saying in the days after the attack. The president had the chance to be more complete and direct in Florida, but the administration was continuing to focus on the response to the video.Just four days earlier, Ambassador Rice downplayed the possibility that the attack was premeditated. The presidents words did not correct that impression.So while Obama did use the word terror, there is also some truth to Romney's point that it took many days for the administration to fully characterize the attack as the work of a terrorist group. So we're still rating this Half True.",0.5,0.5,1,0.5,0,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,Half True

Final Rating: Half True  ",SaysStacey Evans voted for (school) vouchers...in the beginning.,"As public school advocates, Georgia Democratic gubernatorial frontrunners Stacey Abrams and Stacey Evans haveboth taken a firm stance against privatized public education and especially school vouchers. But at a recent forum featuring the two candidates, Abrams accused Evans of voting for vouchers when she was a state representative. You voted for vouchers. You didnt vote for it the last two times, but you voted for it in the beginning, Abrams said on Oct. 2. Abrams later said she was referring to Evans involvement with a bill about the Georgia Student Scholarship Organization. The program began in 2008, three years before Evans held a seat in Georgias General Assembly. Back then, the Student Scholarship Organization bill established a program that allows independent individuals and businesses to receive tax credits if they make donations to local private schools. The money is then used to fund scholarships that are given to qualified, low-income students to attend the private institutions. Abrams claims that Evans had voted in favor of school vouchers a few years later, when the Legislature made revisions to the program. Evans did vote for an early version of the 2011 bill, but not for the final version. According to her campaign, she only voted for the measure because it had provisions that improved the programs transparency. When the final bill hit the House floor with its final revisions, the transparency clauses were removed, so Evans voted against the bill. Evans has also maintained that she has never voted for vouchers because the Student Scholarship Organization is not a voucher program. On June 26, 2017, theGeorgia Supreme Court ruledthat stated that the scholarship program is not a voucher program, because it is financed by private individuals, not public revenue, a fact that Abrams had acknowledged during the debate. Despite the Supreme Court ruling, the Student Scholarship Organizations status as a voucher program is still subject to debate. Before the forum, the Evans campaign had already been defending her stance against vouchers, and on Oct. 12 the Abrams campaign shared its opinion on Facebookthat the funds in the program are vouchers by another name. Our ruling Abrams said Evans voted for (school) vouchers...in the beginning. Abrams said she was referring to the Student Scholarship Organization program. Some aspects of Abrams statement are wrong. Evans wasnt in the legislature in 2008 when program was approved. In 2011, Evans voted for revisions to the program, although she voted against the final version after those revisions were dropped. Over the years, theres been a legal dispute over whether the tax credits that fund the Student Scholarship Organization make the program different from school vouchers. In June 2017 Georgias Supreme Court ruled that the voucher label did not apply. Abrams'claim had some accurate points, but it left out important details.",0.4,0.6,0.8,0.5,0.2,0.5,0.4,0.5,0.4,Half True

Final Rating: Half True","For immigrants with visa overstays, we make no effort to hold them accountable to that or uphold the law.","Republican vice presidential nominee Mike Pence says that in addition to deporting undocumented criminals and strengthening the border, the United States should be tougher about removing people who overstay their visas. An enormous number of people come to this country legally and then simply overstay their visas because we make no effort to hold them accountable to that or uphold the law, Pence said Sept. 4 on NBCs Meet the Press. People who have overstayed their visas account for a large portion of the estimated 11 million people in the country illegally, about 40 percent by some estimates. Are government officials really making no efforts against people who overstay their visas, or to uphold the law? Pences team guided us to a June Washington Times article that says immigration officials catch an abysmally small percentage of the illegal immigrants who arrived on visas but overstayed their welcome. The article attributes that factoid to an admission of immigration authorities. But there is more to the story. Enforcement priorities U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement does go after visa violators, but the agency prioritizes violent undocumented immigrants. The agencys top focusis the removal of people convicted of violent crimes, such as murder and rape, ICE spokesperson Dani Bennett said via email. People who overstay their visas but dont pose a threat to national security, public safety or border security fall into ICEs second priority. The conservative-leaning Washington Times reported that at least 480,000 people didnt leave the country as expected in fiscal year 2015. Immigration officials investigated just 10,000 of these cases and arrested fewer than 2,000 because, as the Times reported, the others dont rise to the level of being priority targets. The article was based on a June 2016 House Homeland Security Committee hearing on overstays. Homeland Security Department officials testified that out of the nearly 10,000 leads pursued: about 4,100 cases were closed for being in compliance; at least 3,000 were under current investigation; 1,910 were arrested, and the rest were under continuous monitoring and further investigation as appropriate. ICE data shows that out of a total 235,413 removals in fiscal year 2015, about 18,500 were second-priority removals. Theres no breakdown of how many of those were visa overstays (that category also includes those convicted of drug-related crimes, unlawful possession or use of firearm and other misdemeanors). Indefinite number of overstays Immigration officials and scholars say not much is known about legal immigrants who overstay their visa, so they rely on estimates. In 2006, Pew Research Center said visa overstays could make up at least 4 millionof the population here illegally, roughly one-third of thatpopulation. The first legal requirement for an entry-exit system came in the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996, according to the Bipartisan Policy Center. It took about 20 years before DHS released its first ever Entry/Exit Overstay Report, though it only contained information for fiscal year 2015. Almost 45 million people were expected to leave in fiscal year 2015, the report said, and about 98.8 percent did so on time. About 482,700 were still in the country by Sept. 30, 2015, the end of the 2015 fiscal year. That dropped to 416,500 by Jan. 4, 2016. Overstay consequences While DHS devotes less enforcement resources to visa overstays than it does to border enforcement, violators are still apprehended and removed, said Donald M. Kerwin, executive director of the Center for Migration Studies, a think tank studying international migration. Undocumented immigrants also are not eligible for most public benefits, said Robert Warren, an expert on immigration and senior visiting fellow at the center. People who overstay their visas and become undocumented may also face limitations when applying for jobs. The Immigration Reform and Control Act in 1986 forbids employers from knowingly hiring people who are not authorized to work in the United States. If they leave and want to come back, they may be disqualified from getting a visa and not be let in, said Lazaro Zamora, a Bipartisan Policy Center senior policy analyst. Under the Immigration and Nationality Act, unlawful presence for more than 180 days is punishable by a 3-year bar against re-entering, and unlawful presence of one year or more is punishable by a 10-year ban, Zamora said. Our ruling Pence said, An enormous number of people come to this country legally and then simply overstay their visas because we make no effort to hold them accountable to that or uphold the law. Pences statement suggests there are no repercussions for people who overstay their visa. While they are not ICEs top concern — officials say they prioritize the removal of convicted criminals over visa violators— they can still be deported and barred from coming back into the United States. About 8 percent of the 235,413 people removed from the country in fiscal year 2015 belonged toa category thatincludes visa overstays.",0.5,0.5,1.0,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,Half True

Final Rating: Half True  ","Says the federal stimulus program was ineffective because the number of jobs has actually decreased by 18,300 through July 2011.","Like most Republicans, Rep. Greg Walden says the $825 billion stimulus law has been a failure.But unlike other critics who speak in contemptuous generalities, Walden puts hard numbers behind his opinion.When the bill was signed into law, the White House promised that the stimulus would increase by 44,000 the number of jobs in Oregon by December 2010, he says on his official congressional website. Unfortunately, even with the stimulus, since the bill was signed, the number of jobs has actually decreased by 18,300 through July 2011.Walden supports his claim with a study by the Republican staff of the House Ways and Means Committee. That study relies on federal statistics and, sure enough, both the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics and the Oregon Employment Department show that Oregon had fewer people working in July 2010 than February 2009.When the stimulus was signed into law in February 2009, 1.643 million people in Oregon held non-farm jobs, according to the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics. In July 2010, after billions of dollars of stimulus spending had been dispersed, the number of non-farm jobs in Oregon was 1.625 million.Thats a loss of 18,000 jobs which is the number Walden cited.But its only part of the story.First, a quick recap. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, which is the full name of what is commonly called the stimulus, became law in February 2009. Democrats pushed the legislation as a way to create jobs and extend unemployment benefits through a mix of government spending, tax cuts and financial aid to cash-strapped states.The stimulus and its performance have provided a high intensity battlefield ever since. The White House released at least six reports on the program, counting jobs that were created or saved as a result of the stimulus. Those counts were augmented by dozens of other reports from independent sources.The most recent came Nov. 22 from the Congressional Budget Office. It says the stimulus is responsible for adding between 500,000 and 3.3 million jobs nationally.But the CBO, which is nonpartisan, also says its reports, do not provide a comprehensive estimate of the laws impact on U.S. employment, which could be higher or lower...Among the reasons is that some of the jobs included in the reports might have existed even without the stimulus, and that the reports do not attempt to measure the number of indirect jobs.Earlier studies, both independent and partisan, have offered similar ranges for the laws impact on jobs. A March study by the White House Council of Economic Advisers explains why.Evaluating the impact, said the report, which was the sixth in a series,   is inherently difficult because we do not observe what would have happened to the economy in the absence of policy.Separately, the councils report cited four independent analyses by the CBO and three private economic analysis companies that all found between 1.3 million and 3.6 million jobs saved or created.Oregons acting state economist Mark McMullen agrees precision is difficult -- and fraught with politics.This issue is about as politically charged as topics in economics get, he said.He points to CBO numbers to explain how many stimulus jobs were created and reported in Oregon. In 2009, 18,412 direct jobs were created with 33,489 in 2010 and 17,663 in 2011.Even trickier is estimating the indirect jobs from the stimulus. Here, McMullen and other economists extend estimates that Oregon collected between 1.2 percent and 1.5 percent of stimulus jobs depending on the year. That translates to 2,967 to 13,350 indirect jobs in 2009; 8,714 to 41,078 jobs in 2010 and 5,820 to 30,473 jobs in 2011.Economists say theres another conundrum: Because of constant churning in the economy, the stimulus law could have generated - or come close to generating - the number of jobs the White House predicted even though total employment in the state declined. The reason is that the jobs total is fluid and that additions in jobs like road construction could be eclipsed by losses in other parts of the economy that arent touched by the stimulus.There are also jobs protected with stimulus money. Teachers, prison guards, and other state workers who probably would have been laid off were able to keep their jobs because the stimulus sent $2.4 billion to Oregon. More than $1.2 billion was used to fill state cuts to education that could have triggered teacher layoffs in every district. Another $117 million went to public safety, with some of that money used to avoid cut-backs in police and emergency response personnel.The White House and supporters factor those saved jobs into their calculations. Walden and critics do not.Got it?Its all very murky and far from precise. But this much is certain: As of July 31, 2011, there were 18,300 fewer people working in Oregon than in February 2009. That is the number Walden cites in his comment and that much is true.But Waldens context suggests that the stimulus did not produce jobs for Oregon, and that is not correct. While economists and other experts say its impossible to say how many Oregon jobs were created or saved, as the White House puts it, there certainly were some. And its clear that a significant number of Oregon jobs would have been lost without the stimulus.Waldens assertion of lost jobs uses numbers out of context and leaves out important details.

Final Rating: Mostly True  ",Jim Renacci supports a national sales tax of 23 percent.,"Rep. John Boccieri, a freshman Democrat from Alliance, is in the cross hairs.The Republican Party wants to recapture the 16th Congressional District seat moderate Republican Ralph Regula held from 1973 until he retired in 2008. Thats when Boccieri, a Ohio legislator and Iraq War veteran, won the seat an open election.Republicans and allied groups are buoyed by the anti-incumbent mood of the electorate and by Boccieris vote for health care reform, which they hope to exploit with voters. On top of that, Boccieri faces a well-financed Republican in Jim Renacci, a former Wadsworth mayor and CPA who co-owns a nursing home as well as car and motorcycle dealerships.But a powerful union -- the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees (AFSCME) -- has come to Boccieris defense, attacking Renacci in a television advertisement that hit the airwaves August 9. Recognizing the anti-tax mood benefiting Republicans, AFSCME wants a piece of the action, accusing Renacci of backing a massive tax hike.Jim Renacci supports a national sales tax of 23 percent, says the union ad, which includes comments from outraged citizens condemning the proposal.The AFSCME ad cites a March 9 primary debate in the 16th District sponsored by Tea Party groups. Though not explained in the ad, the figure of 23 percent is a reference to what some Republicans call a Fair Tax, says Ricky Feller, deputy political director for AFSCME, which oversees the unions independent political arm that is running ads in Ohio.The Fair Tax proposal is federal sales tax on goods and services that – and this is crucial to the debate -- would replace a slew of other taxes, including federal income taxes, Social Security taxes, estate and gift taxes, business taxes and capital gains taxes. Legislation to create such a tax is introduced each year in Congress but goes nowhere.The latest version of the legislation, introduced in 2009 by Rep John Linder, a Georgia Republican, would impose a national sales tax on the use or consumption in the United States of taxable property or services. It sets the sales tax rate at 23 percent in 2011.Boiled down, critics say that Fair Tax proposal is not enforceable, wont cover the revenue generated by the taxes it eliminates and the Fair Tax is regressive, that is, people earning lower incomes will pay a higher percentage of their income toward taxes because they spend a larger portion of their paychecks than wealthy individuals. Proponents argue the Fair Tax plan would spur economic growth because people will have more money to spend and that will generate tax revenue. They say, lower income people would receive a rebate for taxes paid on basic necessities to help keep the system from becoming regressive.The economics behind the Fair Tax proposal are complicated and the subject of books, on-line debates, and fact check articles. For those who want to wade into the weeds, check out FactCheck.orgs take, Unspinning the Fair Tax, published in May 31, 2007, or PolitiFact.coms article, Adding up the Fair Tax, published in January 23, 2008.Whats at issue in the AFSCME ad isnt the economics of the Fair Tax proposal, rather: Did Renacci really say he favors a national sales tax increase of 23 percent.AFSCME did not fulfill its promise to provide PolitiFact a transcript of Renaccis comments or a link to the video of the debate on which the union based its ad, but cited Renaccis campaign website to support its charge.A video of the debateproduced by the Tea Party organizers and available on YouTube shows Renacci at the May event responding to the question: What is the most effective tax system, flat tax, fair tax or the current tax system?Renacci called the Fair Tax a consumption tax and used the two interchangeably. He said the Fair Tax is a good model. I think it is a fair model. The biggest problem with the consumption tax is implementing it. ... I am a firm believer in the fair tax, consumption tax. ... I would like to see a way to have that implemented in a simple fashion.But while the video shows Renacci likes a 23 percent national sales tax, thats not enough to make AFSCMEs ad completely accurate. It leaves out important information about Renaccis record of rhetoric on the matter and how he couched his support during the debate.As a supporter of the Fair Tax proposal, Renacci likes even more the idea of eliminating all other taxes. Hes been consistent in endorsing the Fair Tax plan with caveats: The plan must address the potential negative consequences of implementing it and the plan has to produce a net tax decrease, a point hes made on his Web site from the beginning of his campaign.While I believe that a form of consumption tax or fair tax in lieu of a federal income tax is an idea worthy of further examination, I could only potentially support such a concept if the tax would serve as a replacement to the income tax, not an addition to it, he states.We thought those details were important context for the issue.

Final Rating: Half True  ","Says the term illegal alien is a legal term, its in statute, its a federal term.","An exchange between alegislator and the leader of Texas state law enforcement agency made us wonder whether federal law uses illegal alien to describe any individual living in the U.S. without legal authorization. It doesnt, we learned, though the term makes a few appearances. Many news organizations avoid the IA term. In 2013, the Associated Press dropped illegal immigrant from its stylebook. AP spokesman Paul Colford said then that illegal should be used to describe actions, not people, and the AP counseled journalists against using illegal alien except in direct quotations. We recognize, though, that illegal alien persists. The term showed up 80 times in our May 2018 Google search of the PolitiFact website withillegal aliens popping up 5,620 times. Lets unpack what touched off this fact-check, then turn toillegal alien in American law. West Texaslegislator questions director At an April 18, 2018, Texas House hearing, state Rep. Mary González, D-San Elizario, elicited agreement from Steve McCraw, director of the Texas Department of Public Safety, that the words that we choose to use are powerful. González then told McCraw she had concerns about the language that you use and the agency is using in talking about undocumented immigrants. If were talking about children, for example, unaccompanied minors, then using words like illegal aliens, I have had a concern about that, right? she said. And so but then, in your testimony you used it again. And so Im guessing, my question is, is the agency standard in typically referring to undocumented immigrants as IAs? McCraw answered: I always use illegal aliens and I have when I was assigned to the Department of Justice, when I worked at the FBI, when I was assigned as the director of the foreign terrorism task force because its a term, its a legal term, its in statute, its a federal term--and its not intended to degrade anybody in any way, shape or form. McCraw spent 21 years with the FBI before becoming director of Texas DPS, the state law-enforcement agency known for its state troopers and Texas Rangers. González replied that people in my community would find it very concerning to use this language. McCraw answered that hed consult DPS staff and re-evaluate the use of words that their director has been using to describe, Ive been consistent about that. And it its insulting, if it truly is insulting, I dont intend to insult anybody. We later asked the DPS to elaborate on McCraws claim that illegal aliens appears in statute. We didnt hear back. Checking for illegal alien in federal law Given McCraw's singling out of federal statutes, we launched our post-testimonylook by searchingthe portion of federal law titled Aliens and Nationality, and saw that the chapter titled Immigration and Nationality defines the word alien alone as any person not a citizen or national of the United States. But in the same Definitions section, we spotted illegal just once--and not in the context suggested by the DPS directors testimony. Illegal appears in a section stating that an alien lawfully given permanent residency shall not be regarded as seeking U.S. entry in connection with the countrys immigration laws unless the alien has, among possibilities, engaged in illegal activity after having departed the United States. Another portion of the law says the U.S. attorney general shall have the power and duty to control and guard the boundaries and borders of the United States against the illegal entry of aliens. Our scrolling of the act also picked up a mention of illegal entrants. Federal agency offers examples We separately heard back from Arwen FitzGerald of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. By email, FitzGerald pointed to four uses of illegal alien, two in federal law and the others in a congressional act. Section 1252(c) of the Aliens and Nationality laws is titled: Authorizing State and local law enforcement officials to arrest and detain certain illegal aliens. The section authorizes state and local law enforcement officials to arrest and detain an individual who— (1) is an alien illegally present in the United States; and (2) has previously been convicted of a felony in the United States and deported or left the United States after such conviction. Section 1365, titled Reimbursement of States for costs of incarcerating illegal aliens and certain Cuban nationals, applies to any alien convicted of a felony whos in the country unlawfully and whose most recent entry was without inspection, or whose most recent admission to the United States was as a nonimmigrant and whose period of authorized stay as a nonimmigrant expired, or whose unlawful status was known to the government. FitzGerald also pointed out that a section of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 authorized the hiring of 25 new federal lawyers to prosecute persons who bring into the United States or harbor illegal aliens or violate other criminal statutes involving illegal aliens. Also noted: A section of the act requiring an annual report detailing the number of illegal aliens sentenced or jailed for felonies in state and federal prisons. That act, we saw, relies on the established definition of alien spotted earlier. It doesnt explicitly define illegal alien, though by our count, the term appears nine times including in a section titled Demonstration project for identification of illegal aliens in incarceration facility of Anaheim, California and a section titled Pilot programs on limiting issuance of drivers licenses to illegal aliens. Experts: Mentions dont mean much By email, though, academic experts on immigration law told us such scattered mentions of illegal alien in legislation and law dont mean much. Denise Gilman, who directs the University of Texas immigration law clinic, pointed out that all but one of the terms mentions in the 1996 act appear in section titles, not intended statutory language. The title is a political marker in the legislation but is not the law itself, Gilman wrote. For example, the section titled PILOT PROGRAMS ON LIMITING ISSUANCE OF DRIVER'S LICENSES TO ILLEGAL ALIENS, goes on to use legal terms in the actual text, Gilman wrote, which refers only to aliens who are not lawfully present in the United States. Notably, Rick Su of the University of Buffalo School of Law told us, the IA term doesnt appear in the vast Immigration and Nationality Act, the nations main immigration law. Su acknowledged that the term appears in the 1996 acts section about the federal government reimbursing states for incarcerating certain immigrants. But that section, Su said, defines an illegal alien solely in the context of the section -- as any alien convicted of a felony who is in the United States unlawfully and -- (1) whose most recent entry into the United States was without inspection, or (2) whose most recent admission to the United States was as a nonimmigrant and -- (A) whose period of authorized stay as a nonimmigrant expired, or (B) whose unlawful status was known to the Government, before the date of the commission of the crime for which the alien is convicted. In contrast, Su told us, illegal alien has been commonly used to refer to immigrants simply present in the U.S. without a valid visa or legal status, or whose legal status expired or is terminated. More prevalent terms in federal law, Su said, include inadmissible aliens or unauthorized aliens. Su wrote that inadmissible aliens and deportable aliens are different individuals under the INA, and have specific criteria, he said, with inadmissible aliens probably closest to how the term illegal aliens is commonly used (federal law treats those who enter without inspection to be construed as not having been admitted), Su wrote. All this said, Su said, other government documents--including memos, directives and reports--useillegal alien. The Supreme Court also has used the term, Su said. He singled out the courts rulings in De Canas v. Bica, a case decided in 1976 about California governing the hiring of illegal aliens. Su also noted Arizona v. U.S. in which the court in 2012 upheld parts of Arizonas 2010 immigration law. That opinion employs illegal alien twice in quoting others and twice in speculation about how Arizona might enforce its law. To our inquiry about McCraws claim, Jeff Baker of the Pepperdine School of Law summed up: The term alien is common in the United States Code and in U.S. law, although the term illegal alien is very rare in the statutes. In the Code, alien typically means someone who is not a citizen, and, despite the current political uses and preferences (including my own), this is fairly common. I do not know when alien entered the law with this usage, Baker wrote, but he noted that President John Adams signed the very controversial Alien and Sedition Acts in 1798. Baker went on: That was not the Illegal Alien and Sedition Acts, however. Personally, Baker told us, he favors other language in our national discourse. Alien may be a technical term of art, but illegal alien is almost always pejorative in contemporary usage. State laws Finally, wesearched Texaslaws and the state constitution on the Texas Legislatures website and didnt find illegal alien or illegal aliens though we saw multiple provisions specifying how laws apply to aliens. Our ruling McCraw told legislators the term illegal alien is a legal term, its in statute, its a federal term. The term appears--yet scarcely--in federal law. Best we can tell, though, nolaw defines the term as referring to all individuals living in the U.S. without legal authorization. Where the term does appear,its undefined or part of an introductory title or limited to apply to certain individuals convicted of felonies.

Final Rating: Half True  ","If you're one of the more than 250 million Americans who already have health insurance, you will keep your health insurance.","After the Supreme Court upheld the health care bill hed signed into law, President Barack Obama applauded the decision in a speech at the White House. In that speech, Obama responded to critics, including Mitt Romney, who say the law could force many Americans off their health care plans.If you're one of the more than 250 million Americans who already have health insurance, you will keep your health insurance, Obama said. This law will only make it more secure and more affordable.This is a variation on a line Obama has used before, and which we have rated in the past.For instance, at a town hall meeting in New Hampshire on Aug. 11, 2009, Obama said, If you like your health care plan, you can keep your health care plan. Later, Obama spoke more specifically.In a speech to a joint session of Congress in September 2009, Obama said, If you are among the hundreds of millions of Americans who already have health insurance through your job, or Medicare, or Medicaid, or the VA, nothing in this plan will require you or your employer to change the coverage or the doctor you have. We concluded that nothing in Obamas proposal proactively forced such changes, and the bills clearly intended to leave much of the current health care system in place. The claim Obama made after the Supreme Court decision on June 28, 2012, was a broader statement, and as a result, its less accurate.First, a March 2012 study by the Congressional Budget Office, the nonpartisan number-crunching arm of Congress, projected that 3 million to 5 million fewer non-elderly people would obtain coverage through their employer each year from 2019 through 2022 than would have been the case before the law was passed. Including those with individually purchased policies enlarges that decline by an additional 1 million to 3 million Americans.CBOs estimate is broadly in line with a number of other independent estimates. A study by the Urban Institute projected a decline of about 500,000 people. The Lewin Group predicted a decline of about 3 million people. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services actuary pegged the number at about 1 million fewer people. And the RAND Corp. projected that about 4 million more individuals would be covered by employment-based coverage by 2016.Why are these changes occurring? Some will be made voluntarily by Americans seeking better health care options outside of their employers plan, but we think its reasonable for Obama to ignore these changes in his calculation.Other switches will be involuntary. As we have previously noted, many Americans already lose their current health plan for reasons that have nothing to do with the new law. Your employer may change insurance carriers, for instance, or your insurance carrier may unilaterally modify the terms of your plan.How common is this? The Medical Expenditure Panel Survey, sponsored by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, found that in 2007, just over 14 percent of the entire U.S. population switched health insurance. However, this underestimates the rate of switching, because the study included people of all ages (including those covered by Medicare, who rarely switch) and because it doesnt count a switch from one plan to the other within the same insurance company.The latter scenario is common. Mercer, a private consulting firm, found that in each of the years from 2005 to 2008, roughly a quarter of companies said they made changes to their plans that would result in employees paying a greater share of the cost. In 2009 and 2010, it rose to one-third.The number becomes substantial if you add up the workers who lose coverage entirely; who change jobs (voluntarily or involuntarily); who work for companies that change insurance carriers or adjust plan terms significantly; or whose employers insurance carrier is merged or bought out. And knowing that many workers every year are already required to change plans provides a different impression than what Obama is suggesting.Our rulingObama has a reasonable point: His health care law does take pains to allow Americans to keep their health plan if they want to remain on it.But Obama suggests that keeping the insurance you like is guaranteed. In reality, Americans are not simply able to keep their insurance through thick and thin. Even before the law has taken effect, the rate of forced plan-switching among policyholders every year is substantial, and the CBO figures suggest that the law could increase that rate, at least modestly, even if Americans on balance benefit from the laws provisions.",0.5,0.6,1.0,0.5,0.4,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,Half True

Final Rating: Half True  ",Most people in my home state of Texas disagree with the president building a wall across our border.,"Democratic Congressman Joaquin Castro said at a news conference on Monday that most people in Texas are opposed to constructing a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border. Our country, since its founding, has become the most prosperous and powerful nation on earth without any wall, said Castro, who represents San Antonio. Thats why I believe most of the American people and most people in my home state of Texas disagree with the president building a wall across our border. Castro offered this claim about Texans while discussing legislation he sponsored, approved by the House on Tuesday, that would block President Donald Trumps emergency order aimed at securing funding for his border wall. Its no surprise that the Democratic-controlled House opposes Trumps plan to build a wall, but is Castro right? Do Texans also oppose a wall? Polls show Texans divided on the wall Castro spokeswoman Jamie Geller said the congressmans claim was based on an April 2018 poll published by Quinnipiac University which reported that 53 percent of respondents surveyed opposed construction of a wall, with a margin of error of plus or minus 3.6 percentage points. We decided to take a step back and consider polls released on this subject since 2016 from three non-partisan entities that run surveys in Texas to assess the validity of Castros claim: University of Texas/Texas Tribune polls, Texas Lyceum polls and Quinnipiac University polls. Four polls showed more respondents opposing the wall than supporting it, with one poll showing the opposite. A sixth survey released Tuesday, after Castro made his claim on Texans opposing the wall, revealed an even split. Only two of the polls showed a clear majority in opposition to the wall. A University of Texas/Texas Tribune poll of registered voters in Texas published in June 2016 showed that 52 percent of respondents either strongly supported or somewhat supported a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border. The same poll, which had a margin of error of plus or minus 2.83 percentage points, found 40 percent of respondents said they either strongly opposed or somewhat opposed a border wall. Of those polled, 8 percent said they did not know or had no opinion on the wall. Two years later, in February 2018, a University of Texas/Texas Tribune poll showed that 50 percent of respondents said they either strongly opposed or somewhat opposed a border wall and 45 percent strongly supported or somewhat supported a wall. Two polls from Texas Lyceum, a non-profit organization, showed majorities opposing the wall. These polls did not limit the pool of respondents to likely or registered voters and instead surveyed adults in Texas. A September 2016 poll from the group showed that 59 percent of adults polled opposed Trumps proposed border wall, with 35 percent supporting the wall. The poll had a margin of error of plus or minus 3.1 percentage points. An April 2017 Texas Lyceum poll, which had a margin of error of plus or minus 3.1 percentage points, reported 61 percent of respondents opposing the wall and 35 percent expressing support. One year later, in April 2018, Quinnipiac University released a poll of Texas voters that showed 53 percent of respondents opposed building a wall along the border and 43 percent supported it. The poll surveyed 1,029 voters and the margin of error of 3.6 percentage points raised the possibility that fewer than 50 percent of Texas voters actually opposed the wall. Geller, Castros spokeswoman, pointed to this April 2018 poll as the evidence behind the Democrats claim. On Tuesday, Quinnipiac University released a new poll that shows Texas voters are evenly split on whether they support a border wall. Of the 1,222 voters surveyed, 48 percent said they supported a wall and 48 percent said they opposed one. The poll had a margin of error of plus or minus 3.4 percentage points. Peter Brown, assistant director of the Quinnipiac University Poll, said the results show that Castros claim is not entirely true, at least as of Tuesday afternoon. Its factually wrong, he said. Its 48-48. But do Texas voters support the way Trump is pursuing construction of the wall? The same Quinnipiac University Poll showed that 60 percent of respondents said they disapproved of Trumps move to use emergency powers to secure the funding needed to construct a wall. Our ruling Castro said most people in my home state of Texas disagree with the president building a wall across our border. Polls from the University of Texas/Texas Tribune, Texas Lyceum and Quinnipiac University showed that Texas voters and adults are largely divided on their support for a wall. Only two of the polls showed a clear majority in opposition to the wall – those conducted by Texas Lyceum in 2016 and 2017. In these two polls, the survey questioned adults in Texas and was not limited to likely or registered voters, unlike theUniversity of Texas/Texas Tribune and Quinnipiac University polls. Castros comment was not limited to registered or likely voters, so we kept that in mind while determining a ruling. Recent polls show more Texans opposing a border wall than supporting it, but only two of the six polls we considered showed a clear majority.

Final Rating: Half True  ",Under the Obama economy ... utility bills are higher.,"In his acceptance speech at the Republican National Convention in Tampa, Mitt Romney sought to show how the economy has stumbled under President Barack Obama.In the richest country in the history of the world, this Obama economy has crushed the middle class, he said. Family income has fallen by $4,000, but health insurance premiums are higher, food prices are higher, utility bills are higher, and gasoline prices have doubled.In this item, well look at one of those claims -- that under the Obama economy ... utility bills are higher.When we contacted the Romney campaign, a spokesman said Romney was referring to electricity prices. But in his speech he said utilities, so we'll also examine other types, too.We found data for electricity, natural gas, home heating oil, propane, telephone services, and combined data for water, sewer and trash services. We looked specifically at prices for residential customers rather than commercial or other sectors. We also attempted, where possible, to compare the same months in 2009 and 2012, in order to eliminate any impact from cyclical or seasonal variations. Well take each type of utility in turn.ElectricityThe Energy Information Administration, the federal agency that tracks energy statistics, offers data on average retail prices for electricity residential customers in cents per kilowatt hour.In 2009, Obamas first year, it was 11.51 cents, then rose in 2010 to 11.55 cents and again in 2011 to 11.80 cents. Through the first six months of 2012, it fell slightly to 11.79 cents.So overall, electricity is up by about 2.4 percent over the three-and-a-half year period, or less than 1 percent a year. On this score, Romney is correct.Natural gasObama does better if you look at natural gas. The agency has data for the first five months of 2012, as well as monthly data stretching back for years before that. Specifically, the agency measures dollars per thousand cubic feet for residential customers.When you compare each of the five months in 2009 to its equivalent month in 2012, prices have dropped in every case.For instance, in January 2009, natural gas was $12.49; by January 2012, it was $9.55. And in May 2009, natural gas was $12.86, a price that by May 2012 had dropped to $12.19.So for natural gas, prices have consistently fallen under Obama, often by larger percentages than the rise in electricity.Home heating oilData from the same agency shows that home heating oil was $2.42 per gallon during the week of Jan. 19, 2009, but rose to $3.94 by the week of Jan. 23, 2012. Thats a 62 percent increase over three years, or roughly 20 percent per year -- a big spike.Residential propaneAgency data shows an increase for residential propane prices. For the week of Jan. 19, 2009, residential propane was $2.31 a gallon, a price that rose by the week of Jan. 23, 2012, to $2.86 a gallon. Thats a 24 percent increase, or about 8 percent a year.Water, sewer and trash collectionThe Consumer Price Index -- the governments primary measurement of inflation -- calculates a combined measurement for water, sewer and trash collection. Its an index, meaning that the raw numbers we report below dont correspond to specific dollar amounts per unit but rather provide a way to compare the movements of prices over a given period of time.In July 2009, the index stood at 161.4. By July 2012, it rose to 189.8. Thats an increase of 18 percent, or 6 percent a year.Telephone servicesThe Consumer Price Index also studies telephone prices. In July 2009, the index stood at 102.6 and fell by July 2012 to 101.6. Thats a decrease, though by less than 1 percent per year.Are the increases unique to Obama?Over time, utility prices consistently go up, according to George Washington University economist Tara Sinclair. In fact, rising prices are more the rule than the exception.For example, we looked at how prices for each of these utilities moved during a three-year period of George W. Bush's presidency before Obama took office. We used the same data sources as we did above:Electricity: Up 11 percent from 2006 to 2009, or almost 4 percent per year.Natural gas: Down approximately 10 percent in each of the first five months of the year in 2006 and 2009, or a decline of a bit more than 3 percent a year.Home heating oil: Down by less than 1 percent between January 2006 and January 2009Residential propane: Down about 15 percent between January 2006 and January 2009, or about 5 percent per year.Water, sewer and trash collection: Up about 18 percent between July 2006 and July 2009, or about 6 percent a year.Telephone services: Up about 7 percent between July 2006 and July 2009, or more than 2 percent per year.So under President George W. Bush, three of the six utilities we checked saw increases and three saw decreases – not radically different than the four increases and two decreases under Obama.In fact, for the one measurement the Romney campaign specifically cited when we asked -- electricity prices – rates rose at a significantly faster pace under Bush than they did under Obama.Assigning credit and blameFinally, when speakers make claims that seek to assign credit or blame for a particular statistic, PolitiFact typically looks at the question in two ways: Is the statistic right? And is the claim accurate in its assignment of credit or blame?As weve ruled in the past, presidential policies have some impact on the energy sector due to the governments regulatory role. But the international marketplace and other factors play a role as well. Sinclair, the economist, agreed with that assessment.Our rulingRomney said that under the Obama economy ... utility bills are higher.Under Obama, electricity, heating oil, propane and water-sewer-trash prices did rise, as Romney indicated. But natural gas and telephone prices fell.It's important to note the phenomenon is not unique to Obama. In the comparable three years of the Bush presidency, three of the six utility prices also rose.",0.6,0.4,1.0,0.5,0.3,0.5,0.5,1.0,0.4,Half True

Final Rating: Half True","Nationally, the unemployment rate for veterans is far greater than the national unemployment rate, and Wisconsin is one of those rare examples where unemployment is actually lower for veterans than it is for the population as a whole and certainly lower than it is nationally.","Gov. Scott Walker is touting his record on veterans as he tours the country preparing to make a presidential bid.  At a Politics and Pies event May 30, 2015 in New Hampshire, Walker boasted of the success veterans have had finding jobs in Wisconsin. Nationally the unemployment rate for veterans is far greater than the national unemployment rate, Walker said, adding Wisconsin is one of those rare examples where unemployment is actually lower for veterans than it is for the population as a whole and certainly lower than it is nationally.  Are Wisconsin veterans doing that well in the Wisconsin job market?  To support his claim, Walker's team sent a report from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics about veteran and non-veteran employment. This is the best way to make the comparison, as opposed to measuring veterans vs the overall workforce. Lets see how it breaks down. The national picture: Walker said nationally, the unemployment rate for veterans is far greater than the national unemployment rate.  But the national unemployment rate for veterans is actually lower than the rate for non-veterans. For veterans, the rate was 5.3 percent, compared to 6 percent for non-veterans. That's true historically as well.  A report from the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs shows that from 2000 to 2013, veterans had lower unemployment rates than non-veterans. The Wisconsin picture: Walker also said in Wisconsin unemployment is actually lower for veterans than it is for the population.  Wisconsin's rate for veterans was 4.1 percent while the rate for non-veterans was 5.4 percent. So, the state's veterans are employed at higher rates than their civilian counterparts. How rare is it? In his claim, Walker said Wisconsins situation was a rare one. But 32 other states also had veteran unemployment rates lower than non-veterans. Thats not all that rare. Wisconsin vs. national: Finally, Walker said Wisconsin's veteran unemployment rate was certainly lower than it is nationally. Federal data confirms this aspect of the claim, with Wisconsin's veteran unemployment rate at 4.1 percent, while nationally the rate was 5.3 percent. So, the data he provided supported two of the four aspects to his claim. More about the data Comparing the fraction of vets who are unemployed in the state to the fraction of unemployed vets nationally makes sense, said Steven Deller, a professor of economics at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. But unemployment rates dont necessarily show the whole picture. The data takes an average from the last years monthly Current Population Survey of 60,000 households conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau for the Bureau of Labor Statistics. People who have worked at a regular job in the previous week are considered employed, while people who are jobless, looking for a job and available for work are considered unemployed. But the approach doesnt account for workers who are underemployed or employed outside their field, and doesnt take into account discouraged workers who stopped looking for a job. BLS does calculate other unemployment rates, though they are not often cited by politicians or the media. One is known as the U-6, which takes the total of the unemployed, all persons marginally attached to the labor force and involuntary part-time workers. A rule of thumb puts the U-6 rate as double the conventional unemployment rate. The U-6 rate for Wisconsin is 12.1, while the national rate is 13.8. BLS economist Steve Hipple calculated an estimated U-6 rate for veterans nationally at 9.7 percent. BLS doesnt publish state U-6 rates specifically for veterans, . Our rating Walker said Nationally, the unemployment rate for veterans is far greater than the national unemployment rate, and Wisconsin is one of those rare examples where unemployment is actually lower for veterans than it is for the population as a whole and certainly lower than it is nationally.  Data from BLS supported two of the four aspects of his claim and experts cautioned about use of raw statistics.

Final Rating: Half True  ","Our businesses have created nearly twice as many jobs in this recovery as they had at the same point in the last recovery, when there was no Obamacare.","During a speech on the economy in Galesburg, Ill., President Barack Obama touted his record on job creation. Referring to his Republican critics, Obama said in the July 24, 2013, speech, Theyll bring up Obamacare -- this is tried and true -- despite the fact that our businesses have created nearly twice as many jobs in this recovery as businesses had at the same point in the last recovery, when there was no Obamacare. Well first check whether Obama is correct about job growth, and then take a look at the impact of Obamas health care law. The job numbers Because Obama used the term recovery, we started by looking at Bureau of Labor Statistics job numbers for the first 49 months after the official end of the past two recessions -- that is, from November 2001 until November 2005, when George W. Bush was president, and from June 2009 until June 2013, during Obamas tenure. Under Obamas recovery, private-sector employment increased by a little under 6.05 million, compared to 3.17 million during the equivalent period during the Bush recovery. Thats nearly twice as many jobs, as Obama said. And experts say this is a credible way of measuring the numbers. But it isnt the only way. Instead of starting the clock at the official end of the recovery, one could start it from the low point in private-sector employment. These arent the same dates, because a low point private-sector employment isnt the determining factor for pinpointing the end of a recession. Using this method makes Obamas recovery less impressive. During the Bush recovery, private-sector employment continued to tumble all the way to July 2003 -- a year and a half after the recessions official end. By comparison, during the Obama recovery, private-sector employment began to rise in February 2010, just eight months after the official end of the recession. So the extended slide in private-sector jobs under Bush artificially reduced the number of jobs created during the first part of his recovery. If you count from the low point in private-sector jobs instead, the Bush recovery produced 6.35 million private-sector jobs in the first 41 months, compared to 7.20 million in the first 41 months of Obamas recovery. Thats modestly more private-sector jobs under Obama -- but its not nearly twice as many jobs, as he had said. Theres also a third way to look at it -- looking at all jobs, not just private-sector jobs. Using this measurement casts an even more unfavorable light on the Obama recovery, since the government sector has been among the hardest-hit of any job category in the current recession. If you start counting private and government jobs from the low point in employment, the Bush recovery generated slightly more than 7 million total jobs, which actually exceeds the 6.58 million jobs created in the Obama recovery. Two economists we interviewed -- Gary Burtless of the Brookings Institution and Tara Sinclair of George Washington University -- agreed that the alternative measurements are also valid. But by choosing the more favorable of the two statistics, Sinclair said, I think he's cherry-picking. To in any way claim that this labor market is better than what we had in the mid-2000s just doesn't sound fair to me. To be fair, Burtless said, Obama did acknowledge elsewhere in his speech that, Im here to tell you today that we're not there yet. We all know that. We're not there yet. We've got more work to do. The role of Obamacare Obama used the line were checking as a way of countering Republican claims that the presidents signature health care law is a job-killer. The reality is that no one knows yet how much of a job-killer the law is going to be, or if it will be a job-killer at all. Many key provisions of the health care law havent kicked in yet. That includes new rules with fines for large businesses that dont provide their employees with health care. Republicans say the new rules could drive some employers to shed employees or turn them into part-time employees. Sinclair said its possible that some companies may have pre-emptively cut down on employee hours or laid off workers due to the fear of looming Obamacare mandates, or due to certain Obamacare taxes being imposed. However, even if this is happening, its impossible to quantify the impact with any specificity. Obamacares impact on the currently available job data -- either positive or negative -- is still highly speculative. Our ruling Obama said, Our businesses have created nearly twice as many jobs in this recovery as they had at the same point in the last recovery, when there was no Obamacare. Obamas carefully worded claim uses the most advantageous time frame to measure job growth. Other metrics show that the job recovery he has presided over has been similar to, or even weaker than, the job recovery under Bush.",0.5,0.5,1,0.5,0,0.5,0.5,1,0.5,Half True

Final Rating: True  ","Says the 2010-11 New Hampshire budget ended with an $18 million surplus, while the Republican-led 2012-13 budget has a $40 million deficit."," Just like baseball, New Hampshire's budget season is just getting under way. But even before legislators got their first swing at this years spending proposal, political leaders were already checking the score. N.H. Democratic Party leaders took aim at the current 2012-13 budget on Twitter last month. They contrasted the Republican-led spending plan, crafted two years ago by Senate Majority Leader Jeb Bradley and former House Speaker William OBrien, with the 2010-11 budget, passed by Democratic Gov. John Lynch and Senate President Maggie Hassan, the current governor. NH FACT: Lynch/Hassan 2010/11 budget ended in $18m surplus, Democratic chairman Ray Buckley tweetedFriday, March 29th. OBrien/Bradley 2012/13 budget has $40m deficit. With nearly three months left in the 2013 Fiscal Year, the budget projections are constantly on the move. But, the 2010-11 figures have been set for a while. So, we decided to go back and check the record books. To start, we approached Democratic Party officers, who pointed to a PolitiFact check we conducted back in August looking into the 2010-11 budget. At the time, we checked a claimby the New Boston Republican Committee, that suggested Democrats had built up a deficit of $1 billion in Fiscal Year 2010-11. As we noted then, the $1 billion figure came from a report released in January 2011 by the Legislative Budget Assistant, a nonpartisan office that reviews the state spending plans. The report, intended as a point-in-time projection rather than a final budget tally, identified $845 million in spending that could have posed concerns for the new legislature if all fiscal policies remained the same. I was talking about appropriations that would go up by virtue of formula driven things, Jeff Pattison, the budget assistant, said at the time. Things that would happen if nothing was done about them. But, state legislators, required by law to balance the budget, made the necessary adjustments, and by the end of the year, they had built a $17.7 million surplus, according to the states annual report. Some political leaders argued at the time the numbers were skewed because lawmakers relied heavily on borrowing (more than $130 million, according to some reports) and on one-time federal funds ($80 million-plus) to balance the budget, leaving a structural deficit heading into the next budget cycle. That year, Lynch, Hassan and other Democratic leaders removed the State Liquor Commission off state spending books by putting its $90 million budget in an independent enterprise account, and they saved another $90 million by issuing state-backed bonds rather than paying cash to cover school construction costs. Still, others maintained the surplus came through a range of budget cuts and tax hikes common to the budget cycle. They cut more than $233 million, laying off nearly 200 state workers, closing some programs and making the university system return $25 million in state aid, among other actions. Either way, the $17.7 million surplus officially left from the 2010-11 budget roughly matches the Democratic Partys $18 million claim. So, Buckley is on target on the first part of his claim. Now, on to the 2012-13 budget. To support their $40 million deficit claim, Democratic Party officers directed us toward a Fiscal Year 2013 snapshot, released last month by the budget assistants office. As Buckley suggested, the worksheet, released March 12, did report a $40.7 million revenue shortfall, most of which comes from shortages in Medicaid Expansion Tax revenues ($36.8 million). But, like the 2011 report, Pattison, the budget assistant, intended this release only as a point-in-time projection to give legislators an idea of what could happen in the months to follow. The projections change frequently, Pattison said. Im not saying it changes on a daily basis, but it can change fairly quickly, he warned last week. By the end of March, the projections had changed course. According to a monthly revenue reportreleased Tuesday, April 2, by the Department of Administrative Services, state officials closed March with revenues up $26.6 million over the initial budget projections. If those numbers stand, that would leave the 2012-13 budget facing a $14 million deficit, and further revenues could level the spending by the end of the fiscal year, said Linda Hodgdon, commissioner of the administrative services department, who authored the March report. We're hopeful that because March was such a good month, April will also be a good month, Hodgdon said. If we have another good month, it could potentially close the gap. Thats what Im hoping. Our Ruling Buckley and the Democratic Party are right on with their claim about the 2010-11 budget. That year, lawmakers closed the spending plan with an $18 million surplus. And, though the numbers change constantly, Buckley, the Democratic chairman, is on target regarding the 2012-13 spending plan, as well. Or he was at the time, anyway. Recent reports show the projections have changed, as they will continue to do throughout the rest of the fiscal year, But those numbers, released this week, were not available yet March 29 when Buckley tweeted his claim. Instead, Buckley deferred to a March 12 report, which showed the $40 million deficit. Comparing final state budget figures to a point-in-time snapshot is not exactly an apples-to-apples comparison, since this budget will likely end with a different deficit than Buckley claims. But, at the time of his tweet, Buckleys numbers were right on the money.",1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,True

Final Rating: Mostly True  ",I have always opposed driver's licenses for illegal aliens.,"Republican candidates for an East Texas state Senate seat disagree over whether one of them has endorsed, and voted for, permitting drivers licenses for Texas residents lacking legal permission to live in the country. State Rep.David Simpsonof Longview emailed reporters a Nov. 30, 2015, statement saying Rep. Bryan Hughes of Mineola had slanderously charged Simpson with supporting licenses for illegal immigrants without delivering the factual goods. Simpson further declared: I have always opposed drivers licenses for illegal aliens. We wondered. Some perspective: The Texas Department of Public Safety began requiring license applicants to produce government-issued documents affirming their legal residency status in 2008, and lawmakers voted to require as much in a 2011 special session. Before 2008, according to a July 2011 Texas Tribunenews story, no proof of legal residency was required to obtain a Texas license or state identification card. The spat between Hughes and Simpson developed, we suspect, because Republicans who show weakness on illegal immigration can run into trouble, especially in a party primary. The two are both angling to succeed Kevin Eltife, R-Tyler, representing the Senates District 1. We cant gauge how someone has always felt about an issue. So we limited our scope to signs of Simpson publicly opposing licenses for such immigrants--finding that while theres room for contrary speculation, a little of it caused by his own ambiguous statement, Simpson was among the vast bulk of House members who voted for the 2011 Legislatures mandate to the DPS, arguably a sign he wasnt intent on ensuring that all residents access licenses. News stories Lets start with what Simpson has said in public settings. Hughes campaign pointed out a July 21, 2014, Tyler Morning Telegraphnews storyquoting Simpson after he returned from a weeklong tour of the Rio Grande Valley. We do have a problem with drugs and warlords taking advantage of the situation, Simpson said. We have to require a fulfillment of promises to appear before immigration courts to enter schools. We need to determine the status of these immigrants and not put them in this limbo. They can get an education but not get a drivers license. Thats not right. What wasnt right in Simpsons view wasnt entirely clarified. The story further quoted him saying: We do need to secure the border against crime and terror, in order to defend life, liberty and property. I welcome people to come. We need workers. We do need to limit our health care to emergencies and critical care to immigrants as well as citizens. Whats going on in emergency rooms is not right. We need to stop the freebies, and open the legal pipeline while continuing to secure the border. To our inquiry about Simpsons consistency, Luke Macias, a consultant to Simpsons campaign, guided us to Simpsons 2014 98-slidepresentationbased on the legislators border trip, which includedphotos of his travels and thoughts about border and immigration policy. Macias urged us to notethe slide indicating Simpson thinks Texas should overturn the mandate to educate aliens who have entered the country illegally or who are still residents of Mexico. A1982 U.S. Supreme Court decision, in Plyler v. Doe, required Texas not to deny public education to undocumented school-age children. Another Simpson slide, titled Dysfunctional Policies, including this license line: We provide K-12 education, but students cannot receive a drivers license:  SOURCE:Presentation,A Sobering and Beautiful Week on the Rio Grande,David Simpson, June 30-July 6, 2014 (web link received by email from Luke Macias, general consultant, David Simpson Texas Senate campaign, Dec. 1, 2015) What gives? By phone, Simpsontold us he was trying to stress his continuing belief in not giving handouts and privileges to immigrants living here without permission; those include drivers licenses, he said. By email, Simpson noted accurately that while his presentation called for some changes--such as ending the public schooling of children in the country illegally--it did not advocate for giving drivers licenses to illegals. Our searches via the Nexis news database and through news stories published by the LongviewNews-Journalyielded no examples of Simpson previously offering an opinion on drivers licenses forimmigrants. Simpsons legislative record Next, we took up Simpsons legislative record. In summer 2011, lawmakers moved to require the DPS to seek proof of legal residency from applicants for drivers licenses by placingan amendment on a fiscal matters measure. At the time, the move was pitched as bringing Texas into compliance with the federal REAL ID Act, which says applicants for a driver's license must prove legal residency if they want to use the identification to get through airport security. See the agency's explanation here. And on June 9, 2011, nearly all House members (including Simpson) approved the amendment toSenate Bill 1. House video reveals no debate of the matter after Rep. Charles Geren, R-Fort Worth, told colleaguesthe amendmentaddresses an issue of people getting Texas drivers licenses that dont live in Texas and it also allows the department to issue a license only for the length of time that a person is entitled to be here.According to the House Journal, eight members, Simpson not among them, asked to be recorded voting against the amendment. Records show too that Simpson voted against the overall fiscal matters proposal several times; the votes occurred onJune 9,June 10andJune 28, 2011. By email, Simpsons told us he opposed the measure due to its accounting gimmicks—namely, the deferment of Foundation School Program payments and the speed-up of tax payments—and its misplaced priorities, not because of the license provision, which I supported. He provided a copy of aMay 2012 letterto constituents stating that he voted for the amendment to add documentation requirements for driver's licenses but against SB 1 because it extended inequitable school funding, sped tax collections and used smoke and mirrors to balance the state budget. So, Simpson backed the mandate that DPS check on each applicants legal residency. Two years later, though, Simpson cast a vote at leastleaving room for speculation about his consistency on this front. That year, he voted against successful House efforts effectively killing proposals that related to more residents possibly getting driving permits. We know of no independent way of telling if those votes signaled a position on drivers licenses. But on May 20, 2013, Simpson voted in favor of one of the failed amendments, theTexas House Journalshows. The amendment to Senate Bill 1729 by Rep. Byron Cook, R-Corsicana, said that under the legislation, which otherwise authorized a pilot project enabling a few counties to update or renew drivers licenses, a license should include any Texas resident drivers permit authorized by law. And what did that mean? In debate, opponents said Cooks language related to unauthorized residents getting a drivers permit. Similarly, Simpson and Hughes campaign each nudged, conservative advocacy groups characterized the amendment as opening drivers licenses to ineligible individuals. In ascorecard of the 2013 Legislature, for instance, the Young Conservatives of Texas said Cooks amendment would have allowed for illegal immigrants to receive drivers licenses. We didnt reach that conclusion--and by email, Simpson told us Cooks amendment in no way authorized illegal aliens to receive drivers licenses. Asked why he voted for it, Simpson said: I voted yes to the amendment because it would only include licenses or permits already authorized by law. In debate, Cook didnt dispute that his proposal might legalize more drivers; he also stressed that another change in law would be needed for the envisioned permits to become a reality. Cooks proposal drew 72 votes, with 67 members voting no, but it died because Cook offered the proposal during final consideration of SB 1729; at that stage, 100 House votes were needed to amend legislation. A few days earlier, on May 17, 2013, Cook rolled out a longer amendment to SB 1729. He described the proposal--which was shortly derailed on a parliamentary point of order without members (including Simpson) voting on it--as identical to a committee-approved version ofHouse Bill 3206by Rep. Roberto Alonzo, D-Dallas. Alonzos amended plan called for state-issued driving permits for residents who lack proof of legal residency, also requiring recipients to obtain auto insurance. Under the proposal, every applicant would have to submit to fingerprinting and clear a criminal background check before qualifying for a permit. The same month, Hughes campaign noted, Simpson was on the losing end of an 87-60 House vote setting aside Alonzos amendment to aHouse measurethat authorized the state to let public schools and driving schools give the driving test required to get a license. Before that May 21, 2013, action, Alonzo told House colleagues that under his amendment, schools could give driving tests to individuals who obtained resident driving permits, provided such permits were legalized. Texas has a problem, Alonzo said, with people driving without auto insurance or a drivers permit. By phone, Alonzo told us he favors giving undocumented individuals an opportunity to legally drive in Texas and his 2013 proposals described permits could have nudged the state toward fulfilling the goal though, he said, it didnt provide for full-fledged licenses. Finally, we spotted no evidence of Simpson trying to legislate about drivers licenses. In the 2011 session, Simpson authored or co-authored about 50 measures, none touching on giving or denying licenses. In the 2013 and 2015 sessions, Simpsonauthored or co-authorednearly 150 measures, none of them affecting drivers licenses. Our ruling Simpson said hes always been opposed to illegal immigrants having drivers licenses In 2011, Simpson joined House members in voting for the change in law requiring license applicants to document their legal residency, which we take as a strong indication of his position. But theres a hint of uncertainty in Simpsons 2013 vote on a proposal offered in favor of unauthorized residents someday getting resident driver permits as sought by Alonzo and others, which importantly didnt and dont exist, and his ambiguous 2014 remark about drivers licenses.

Final Rating: Half True  ",An estimated 56 million Americans don't have bank accounts.,"There's more than one source on these bank account figures and all of them are estimates. But no matter the details, the point Edwards seeks to make is the same: Because they lack bank accounts, millions of poor must rely on expensive check-cashing services and payday loans. The Edwards campaign Website uses the Center for American Progress, a left-leaning think tank for its figure of about 56 million people without accounts. The center got the number from a 2002 report by the General Accounting Office, which used U.S. Census data to estimate that 55.9-million adults did not hold checking, savings or money market accounts in 1999. But that number is at the high end of the available estimates. According to the Federal Reserve Board's 2004 Survey of Consumer Finances, its most recent, the number of American families without a bank account is closer to 10-million. The Census estimates 2.6 individuals per houshold, which would put the Federal Reserve estimate on bank accounts at 26-million at the very most because the Census household figure includes children.

Final Rating: True  ","Between 2010 and 2014, there was no net in-migration from Mexico.","Among the more inflammatory words out of Donald Trumps mouth during his kick-off speech were the ones about Mexico. When Mexico sends its people, theyre not sending their best, Trump said as he announced his White House bid. Theyre sending people that have lots of problems, and theyre bringing those problems (to) us. Theyre bringing drugs. Theyre bringing crime. Theyre rapists. And some, I assume, are good people. That last phrase hardly counterbalanced the rest. Mexican officials took serious offense. The interior minister said the charge was absurd and prejudiced, and that it served only to generate controversy. The Daily Shows Jon Stewart had a go at Trump with former President Bill Clinton on June 17, 2015. Clinton: What he said about the Mexicans, which was  Stewart: Bizarre. Clinton: Not only that, just wrong. Basically between 2010 and 2014, there was no net in-migration from Mexico. That surprise you all? All we read about is the violence and the drug war. The truth is that the previous president built 140 tuition free universities. Two years ago, the Mexicans produced 113,000 engineers. We produced 120,000. Theyve had very brisk growth, and except in the narco-centers, the crime rate, the murder rate has gone down. Its a very interesting country. Theres plenty of interesting statistics there, but well focus just on the one about zero net in-migration. We asked the Clinton Foundation for the data behind that claim but didnt hear back. Still, we were able to reach experts who were able to walk us through the numbers. One way to measure net migration (the number of new arrivals versus the number who leave) is the count of people living in America who were born in Mexico. The Census Bureau tracks this. We used two sets of numbers from the American Community Survey -- an estimate based on three years of surveys and an estimate based on just the year the survey took place. Year Born in Mexico 3-year average estimate (1,000s) 1-year estimate (1,000s) 2013 11,604 11,585 2012 11,650 11,563 2011 11,700 11,673 2010 11,642 11,711 Source: American Community Survey While theres a little variation, both estimates show a drop from 2010 to 2013. Steven Camarota, director of research at the Center for Immigration Studies, a group that favors reduced immigration, told us that the Mexican-born figures are a valid indicator of the overall trend. This strongly implies zero net (migration), Camarota said. Another researcher, Marc Rosenblum at the Migration Policy Institute, echoed that point. What about 2014? Thats the end point for Clintons comparison, but finalized numbers arent out yet. To get a sense of what the numbers might say, Camarota dug into the raw monthly counts from the Current Population Survey. These figures are less reliable, but they too show a consistent decline for Mexicans living in the United States in each of the first quarters of 2012 through 2014. (Camarota did find a rise in the first quarter of 2015, but that is outside Clintons window.) We should note that using a population count isnt a perfect yardstick. In theory, a higher death rate could drive the numbers down, but thats unlikely. First, it would be headline news if thousands of people started dying like that. Second, Rosenblum noted that Mexican immigrants tend to be in their prime working years and younger people are healthier. A more complete study of net migration from Mexico came out in 2012. The Pew Research Center reported back then that based on census data from both sides of the border, from 2005 to 2010, more people moved from America to Mexico than the reverse. That study raised the possibility that the net migration rate wasnt just zero -- it might actually be negative. Rosenblum thinks thats probably still true because some factors behind the shift show no sign of letting up. In short, Clinton is right on the general trend experts agree, though we dont yet have the numbers for 2014 to completely confirm his point. Four reasons for the decline Demographics is possibly the biggest driver of the change in migration. The birth rate in Mexico has fallen steadily since at least 1990 and now stands at 2.2 children per woman. Rosenblum said that translates into fewer people coming into the workforce. In the 1980s, there was a surge of teenagers, Rosenblum said. With the birth rate having been down for several decades, were now seeing many fewer Mexicans entering the prime working age group. Rosenblum said apprehensions at the border strongly suggest that fewer people are trying to sneak into the country. Data from the U.S. Border Patrol show a drop of more than 50 percent since 2009. It used to be border agents stopped over half a million people coming in from Mexico. Last year, it was about 230,000. Not all of those people were Mexican, but the numbers are in line with the picture Clinton paints. Rosenblum also believes that more surveillance, stiffer penalties and more barriers at the border have had the intended effect. All that enforcement has begun to pay off, he said. Other drivers include the hit on the construction industry during the recession. That was a sector that drew many immigrants and while it has recovered a bit, it is not nearly as robust as it once was. Plus, according to one survey, Mexicans who return to their native country generally find that they make more money than when they left. Our ruling Clinton said that between 2010 and 2014, there was zero net in-migration from Mexico. The census data to prove that isnot in for 2014, but the numbers up to 2013 support his point, as do very preliminary 2014 data.The population of people living in America but born in Mexico fell by about 40,000 since 2010. Thats not a perfect measure, but the experts we reached said it is a strong indication of a prevailing trend. The experts we reached said that other data, including a rapid decline in apprehensions at the border and changing demographics in Mexico add weight to the conclusion that Clinton was correct.",1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,True

Final Rating: Mostly True  ","Under Ted Cruzs tax plan, businesses will now have to pay 16 percent on the money they make. They will also have to pay 16 percent on the money they pay their employees.","Ted Cruzs tax plan, envisioning tax returns that fit on postcards, would whack businesses twice over, Marco Rubio says. We wondered about that. In the Jan. 14, 2016, Fox Business Network Republican presidential debate in North Charleston, S.C., Sen. Rubio of Florida said that under the plan advocated by Sen. Cruz of Texas, businesses basically will have to pay a tax, both on the money they make, but they also have to pay taxes on the money that they pay their employees. A moment later, Rubio said Cruzs plan does not eliminate the corporate (income) tax or the payroll tax. Businesses will now have to pay 16 percent on the money they make. They will also have to pay 16 percent on the money they pay their employees. Cruz disputed that characterization, saying in part that a critical piece that Marco seems to be missing is that this 16 percent business flat tax enables us to eliminate the corporate income tax. It goes away. Cruzs plan replaces the corporate income tax, the payroll tax and others with a flat tax. Does it also make businesses pay 16 percent on profits and payroll, as Rubio said? Cruzs plan outlined After emailing Rubios campaign about how he reached his 16 percent conclusions, we turned to Cruzs tax plan as outlined by his campaign. Under the Simple Flat Tax, Cruz says on a campaign webpage, the current seven rates of personal income tax will collapse into a single low rate of 10 percent. For a family of four, the first $36,000 will be tax-free. The Child Tax Credit will remain in place, Cruz proposes, and the plan revamps the earned-income tax credit while preserving deductions for charitable contributions and mortgage interest payments. Heres the flat-tax postcard as envisioned by Cruz:  SOURCE: Web page, The Simple Tax Plan, Ted Cruz presidential campaign (viewed Jan. 20, 2016) Next up: the 16 percent element. On Cruzs website, we spotted no direct indication the 16 percent would apply to payroll spending. For businesses, Cruz says there, the corporate income tax will be eliminated. It will be replaced by a simple Business Flat Tax at a single 16 percent rate. The current payroll tax system will be abolished, while maintaining full funding for Social Security and Medicare. Cruz further says the business flat tax will be based on revenues minus expenses such as equipment, computers, and other business investments. In general, Cruz says, his proposed tax overhaul will deliver a tremendous economic boost, according to the well-respected Tax Foundation, a Washington, D.C., nonprofit that describes itself as a leading independent tax policy research organization. Independent breakdowns We fetched the foundations October 2015 analysis of Cruzs plan which, the foundation said, would replace the corporate income tax and all payroll taxes with a 16 percent Business Transfer Tax, or subtraction method value-added tax. In addition, his plan would repeal a number of complex features of the current tax code. Farther along, the analysis spelled out a payroll aspect. Specifically, the foundation said, Cruzs plan: Enacts a broad-based, 16 percent Business Transfer Tax or value-added tax. This tax is levied on all business profits, less capital investment. This would include the payroll of business, government, and nonprofit institutions, as well as net imports. The tax would exempt from taxation the purchase of health insurance. A business transfer tax is also often known as a subtraction-method value-added tax. While its base is identical in economic terms to that of the credit-invoice VAT seen in many OECD countries, it is calculated from corporate accounts, not on individual transactions. The foundation also said: Under current law, some taxes on labor are explicitly levied on nominal wages, reducing take-home pay, while others are implicitly passed on to workers through lower nominal wages. The business transfer tax would also fall substantially on payrolls, but it would do so entirely through implicit reductions in nominal wages rather than explicit reductions in take-home pay. Thats a bit gobbledy-gooky for us. A foundation official, Kyle Pomerleau, told us by phone and email that what Rubio said largely holds up, though it would be wrong to conclude businesses under Cruzs plan would pay 16 percent on the same money twice. That is, Pomerleau elaborated, Cruzs plan eliminates the existing payroll tax, which is 15.3 percent of wages (half of that paid by employers, the other half by employees), but the plan counts payroll expenditures as part of net business profits, which are taxed at 16 percent. Even though his plan gets rid of the payroll tax, Pomerleau emailed, his new Business Flat Tax will end up taxing that payroll by disallowing its deduction at the business level. Another authority, Joe Rosenberg of the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center, told us by phone that Rubio was accurate about Cruzs plan presuming he meant what most people define as profit by his phrase what you make. Rosenberg walked us through how he sees Cruzs plan working: Say a business buys something for 50 cents at wholesale and has to pay its employees 50 cents, accumulating $1 in costs. Then the business sells the something for $1.10, drawing a 10-cent profit. Under the Cruz plan, Rosenberg said, the business pays the flat tax solely on the 60-cent difference between the $1.10 in sales and the 50 cents spent on the wholesale purchase. And, Rosenberg noted, theres another way to pin what Cruzs plan subjects to the 16 percent tax -- by isolating what the business makes, the 10 cents, and then adding the 50 cents in employee payroll. Its very fair to interpret what Sen. Rubio said as correct, Rosenberg said, though its also worth mention (again) that Cruzs plan eliminates existing payroll and income taxes. Broadly, Rosenberg didnt agree that Cruzs plan whipsaws businesses, saying: Its a change in the way theyre taxed. Its not taxing something twice. We didnt hear back from Rubios camp about his claim nor did Cruz aides engage. Footnote: A Jan. 14, 2016, foundation post by economist Alan Cole says Cruz and Rubio arent proposing entirely distinct tax approaches. In fact, Cole wrote, if you put together two taxes from Rubios plan (and fiddle with the rates), you can actually synthetically construct the business flat tax from Cruzs plan! Our ruling Rubio said that under Cruzs tax plan, businesses will now have to pay 16 percent on the money they make. They will also have to pay 16 percent on the money they pay their employees. Under Cruzs plan, that rate applies both to net income and payroll expenditures though the way this description was phrased by Rubio merits clarification. That is, the 16 percent would not be applied to what a business makes and separately applied again to money paid to employees. Also unsaid: The proposed tax would replace taxes including payroll and income taxes. MOSTLY TRUE – The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information.

Final Rating: Mostly True  ","We took a deal to the president just last February, less than a year ago -- $25 billion over 10 years in border security done the right way -and the president blew up the deal.","Sen. Tim Kaine says President Donald Trump was once offered all the money he wanted for Southern border security, and turned it down. His comments came during a Jan.9 interview on CNN, amid a federal government shutdown over disagreements on funding to expand a security wall on the Southern border.Trump is demanding $5.7 billion for project; congressional Democrats are drawing the line at $1.3 billion. Kaine said his fellow Democrats have tried in the past to compromise with Trump on border security, but to no avail. We took a deal to the president just last February, less than a year ago - $25 billion over 10 years in border security done the right way - and the president blew up the deal, Kaine said. We wondered whether Kaines statement is accurate. Miryam Lipper, the senators spokesperson, referred us to a short-lived bill the senator co-sponsored in February 2018. The Senate was intensely debating immigration. Trump had announced that on March 5, he would begin winding down the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program - or DACA - that protects from deportation children who were brought to the U.S. as illegal immigrants. The Senate was seeking a broad compromise with Trump on immigration policies that would save DACA before the March 5 deadline. Trump backed a Republican bill that would have appropriated $25 billion for border security. The legislation honored four conditions the president set for continuing DACA: Provide money to build the wall; Establish a path to citizenship for DACA children, or dreamers; End the visa lottery program that promotes ethnic diversity of immigrants, and Severely limit family-based immigration - what Trump calls chain immigration. Ending the diversity visa lottery and restricting family-based immigration - which the Democrats call family reunification -were anathema to Democrats. Without bipartisan support, the bill couldnt reach the 60 votes needed to end debate on it and to advance to a pass-or-fail roll call. So Democrats and a handful Republicans - on Feb. 14, 2018 - introduced a substitute bill that they hoped would muster enough bipartisan backing to pass the 60-vote cloture rule. The measure called for $25 billion in border spending over 10 years for wall construction and a host of other security measures. The bill, however, did not address Trumps demands to end the lottery and narrow family-based immigration. On Feb. 15, White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sandersissued a statement threatening Trump would vetothe substitute bill. Trump, in tweets, called the bill a total catastrophe, that would create mass amnesty for over 10 million illegal aliens, including criminals. The Washington Post and The New York Times reported that Trump also objected that the bill wouldallocatethe $25 billion over 10 years, instead of all at once. Later that day, the bill failed. Although a bipartisan group of 54 senators voted for cloture - a majority - they came short of the 60 votes needed to advance. Minutes later, the Republican bill backed by Trump also died. Congress failed to reach the March 5 deadline to protect DACA, but the phase-out of the program has put on hold by several courts. Our ruling Kaine said, We took a deal to the president just last February, less than a year ago -$25 billion over 10 years in border security done the right way -and the president blew up the deal. Hes referring to a 2018 bill backed by Senate Democrats and a few Republicans that would have provided $25 billion over a decade to significantly expand the wall and fund other programs to improve Southern border security. Trump vehemently opposed the bill and threatened to veto it because it did not contain two immigration reforms he demanded: ending the visa lottery and deeply restricting family-based immigration. We quibble, however, with Kaines use of the term deal, which suggests everything was guaranteed for passage if the president went along. Republicans lawmakers never made that promise.

Final Rating: Mostly True  ","Just in the Austin MSA alone, 150 people move here every day.","An activist questioning plans to include a U.S. citizenship question in the 2020 Census warned that if fewer Texans fill out the decennial survey, the state could be shorted government aid and full representation, both tied to population counts. Additionally, I want to just emphasize the growth of Texas, Jose Carrillo of the NALEO Educational Fund said at a March 28, 2018, Texas Capitol press conference. The fund is part of the National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials. Just in the Austin MSA alone, Carrillo said, 150 people move here every day. So those folks need resources, and government needs to provide those resources. MSA means metropolitan statistical area. Its been a spell since weve fact-checked how many people flock to the state's capital and stick around. But in 2014, we found Mostly False a claim that 110 people a day were moving to Austin alone. That figure was in the ballpark for the number of people moving to the five-county region, as Ryan Robinson, the city demographer, reaffirmed in a 2018 statement he emailed to our renewed inquiry. We concluded before, though, that Austin alone was netting perhaps 40 to 60 additional residents a day. Carrillo cites net growth So, whats the latest in population changes in the region encompassing Travis, Williamson, Hays, Caldwell and Bastrop counties? By phone, Carrillo told us he got his tally from the Greater Austin Chamber of Commerce. The chambers Beverly Kerr subsequently told us she drew on the latest annual U.S. Census Bureau estimate that as of July 2017, the Austin-Round Rock MSAs population totaled 2,115,827, up 55,269 from 2,060,558 the year before. That breaks out to regional growth of 151 people a day over the 12 months taking into account both people coming from other places and local births continuing to outpace deaths, Kerr and Lloyd Potter, the Texas state demographer, each advised by email. In the MSA, the bureau says, births over the 12 months outpaced deaths by 16,791, with the difference accounting for 46 of the regions 151 new residents a day. Put another way, net migration into the region occurred at a rate of 105 residents a day. In reality, Kerr wrote, a good deal more than 105 people or 150 people move to Austin each day, but a lot of people move out, too. Fewer people leave We asked both experts to speak solely to Carrillo's focus on people moving into theregion. Kerr noted that the bureaus 2016 American Community Survey estimated that 129,119 of 2,030,464 Austin-Round Rock region residents over 1 year old had moved to the area in the same year from a different region or from abroad--which breaks out to a (gulp-inducing) 354 incoming residents a day. Potter noted separately that per five-year ACS estimates, 211 people a day moved out of the Austin region to another U.S. locale; the survey doesnt tally people whove left for another country. All told, Potter said by email, the five-year ACS results suggest the region was netting 138 people a day in the period, counting more than 350 new residents a day. It's worth stressing that the approximately 350 new residents a day estimate is one-sided in that itdoesnt take into account people leaving the region. Potter counseled too that the ACS count wasbased on annualizing responses to surveys and then statistical weighting of responses, meaning theres sampling error at work, he said. In sum, Potter wrote, I think it is most accurate to say there were, on average, 151 additional residents per day between July 1, 2016 and July 1, 2017 and that on average, 105 of the additional residents are the result of net-migration. Our ruling Carrillo said: Just in the Austin MSA alone, 150 people move here every day. The five-county regions population grew by 151 people a day in the 12 months up to July 2017, according to the latest annual federal estimate. This growth was mostly due to people moving in outpacing people leaving the region with a third of the net growth tied to local births outpacing deaths. But specific to what Carrillo said, Census Bureau work rooted in surveys taken in the five years through 2015 suggests that about 350 people a day were moving into the region. It's worth stressing, though, that thisfigure doesn't account for people who (inexplicably) skedaddled. MOSTLY TRUE – The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information.

Final Rating: Mostly True  ","In Florida felonies can be things like buying weed, tampering with an odometer or disturbing a lobster trap. So basically spring break.","Comedian Samantha Bee traveled to Florida, where she says retirees and democracy go to die, to shed light on how the state makes it difficult for felons to regain the right to vote. On her TBS show Full Frontal on May 10, Bee spotlighted efforts by advocates to collect about 700,000 signatures to place a question on the 2018 ballot. The amendment, which would have to pass by 60 percent to be enacted, calls for restoring voting rights for felons automatically for those who have fully completed their sentences including parole or probation. That would not apply to those convicted of murder or sexual offenses who would still have to ask the Cabinet to restore their rights, a process which is currently slow and cumbersome. In Florida, about 1.7 million felons have lost their right to vote. Bee portrayed some of those felonies as not so serious. In Florida felonies can be things like buying weed, tampering with an odometer or disturbing a lobster trap, Bee said. So basically spring break. Bees big point: Felons in Florida arent just axe murderers. We will fact-check if the crimes Bee cited are felonies. A spokesman for Bee declined to comment on the record. Under the Florida Constitution, a convicted felon cannot vote, serve on a jury, or hold public office until civil rights have been restored. The policy stems back to the Jim Crow era. And that doesnt only apply to violent offenses, said Randall Berg of the Florida Justice Institute. Any felony conviction in Florida, no matter how small or seemingly trivial, results in the loss of your civil rights, Berg said. There have been efforts on and off since the 1970s to make the process easier. But in 2011, Gov. Rick Scott and the members of the Florida Cabinetdecided to make the process more cumbersome and set a minimumfive-year waiting period. Through April 1, 2017, about 2,600 felons have gotten their rights restored since 2011, while more than 10,000 cases are pending. Bee cited three statutes that are felonies in Florida:  • 893.13 (2) (a) 2: This statute bans buying or possession with intent to sell drugs, including marijuana which is a third-degree felony. Possession of a small amount of cannabis -- less than 20 grams -- is a misdemeanor. • 319.35 (1) (a) tampering with an odometer: It is unlawful for any person knowingly to tamper with, adjust, alter, set back, disconnect, or fail to connect an odometer of a motor vehicle, or to cause any of the foregoing to occur to an odometer of a motor vehicle, so as to reflect a lower mileage than the motor vehicle has actually been driven... This is a third-degree felony. • 379.367 (4) disturbing a lobster trap: It is unlawful for any person willfully to molest any spiny lobster traps, lines, or buoys belonging to another without permission of the license holder. This is a third-degree felony. While we were unable to find any data on how many people had lost their rights based on particular statutes, we did obtain conviction data for the statutes Bee cited from the Florida Department of Law Enforcement. Here are the convictions for those offenses between 2012 and 2016, which make up a tiny slice of all felony convictions in that period: • Buying or possessing marijuana: 398 felony convictions with specification of marijuana. • Messing with an odometer: 1felony conviction • Disturbing a lobster trap: 4felony convictions Marc Mauer, executive director of the Sentencing Project, pointed to national data for 2006 that showed about 18 percent of felony convictions in state courts were for violent offenses. The majority of convictions were drug and property offenses. We tend to think of felonies as being represented in the prison population, but that's a skewed view that doesn't incorporate the more numerous people who are sentenced to some type of probation or community service, Mauer said. Bee interviewed one person who opposes automatic restoration of rights for felons generally: Roger Clegg, a former deputy assistant attorney general in the Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush administrations. He has called for states to address restoration on a case-by-case basis. Clegg said that of course some crimes appear less serious than others, but the ones Bee cited are serious for the victims. For example, if someone sells a car that has 200,000 miles on it but has tampered with the odometer to show only 20,000 miles, that is cheating the buyer out of thousands of dollars. You can ask someone who makes his or her living as a lobster fisherman if its a trivial matter if someone molests (the statutes word) his or her traps, he said. Bee said, In Florida felonies can be things like buying weed, tampering with an odometer or disturbing a lobster trap. So basically spring break. Bee is correct that these crimes are felonies on the books in Florida. Only a handful of felony convictions for tampering with an odometer or disturbing a lobster trap in recent years. The drug statute she cited resulted in about 400 felony convictions related to marijuana. For small amounts of marijuana, the crime is a misdemeanor.",1.0,0.1,1.0,0.8,0.5,0.2,0.3,1.0,0.7,Mostly True

Final Rating: Mostly True  ",We've had 27 (Ebola) outbreaks around the globe and they've never spread outside of the confines of the countries that were initially affected.,"The latest news on Ebola finally seems to be headed in the right direction. The World Health Organization declared Nigeria and Senegal to be Ebola-free. None of the people who lived in the apartment of Thomas Eric Duncan, the man who died in Dallas, have contracted the disease. Beyond the two nurses now in treatment, there are no reports that hospital staff who helped care for Duncan have the virus. While the situation in Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea remains dire, more equipment and medical professionals are arriving on the scene. Based on all this, MSNBC host Chris Hayes took an optimistic stance during his show on Oct. 20. It is a disease that can be wrestled to the ground and essentially snuffed out the way you might fight a forest fire, Hayes said. If there's sufficient resources in those three West African countries. Hayes guest, pediatrician and health care television personality Corey Hebert, backed up that view. We've had 27 outbreaks around the globe and they've never spread outside of the confines of the countries that were initially affected, Hebert said. So, it's not something that we have to worry about like in the movie Outbreak. It's not like that. The 1995 film Outbreak did pretty well at the box office, but our fact-check focuses on Heberts numbers, not his taste in movies. We emailed him to learn where he got his figures and did not hear back. We found two lists of Ebola outbreaks, and while it's pretty clear thatHebert overshot the number of outbreaks, his general point is accurate. In the past, thanks to public health efforts, the virus has not spread beyond the borders of the countries that were first affected. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention lists a total of 34 incidents involving one strain or another of the Ebola virus since it was first identified in 1976 in Zaire. However, not every incident meets the definition of an outbreak. In places such as England, Italy and Russia, some people caught it in their labs. A strain of the virus infected some pigs in the Philippines and some workers there developed antibodies but never showed any symptoms. There were instances where just a single person died.If you discount exposures in the laboratory, infections of animals, you are left with 19 outbreaks before the current one. Add in the three lone deaths unrelated to a lab exposure, and the total is 22. The World Health Organization has its own list that doesnt include lab or animal infections. Its list has 20episodes andincludes four incidents in which there was a single death or no deaths at all. Adjusting for those individual cases, the WHOs outbreak count is 16. Heres the WHO list: Year Country Cases Deaths 2012 Democratic Republic of Congo 57 29 2012 Uganda 7 4 2012 Uganda 24 17 2011 Uganda 1 1 2008 Democratic Republic of Congo 32 14 2007 Uganda 149 37 2007 Democratic Republic of Congo 264 187 2005 Congo 12 10 2004 Sudan 17 7 2001-02 Congo 59 44 2001-02 Gabon 65 53 2000 Uganda 425 224 1996 South Africa (ex-Gabon) 1 1 1995 Democratic Republic of Congo 315 254 1994 Cote d'Ivoire 1 0 1994 Gabon 52 31 1979 Sudan 34 22 1977 Democratic Republic of Congo 1 1 1976 Sudan 284 151 1976 Democratic Republic of Congo 318 280 Source: World Health Organization In both tallies, each outbreak happened in just one country. The current crisis is the first where Ebola has hit several nations simultaneously. (Through Oct. 17, Ebola has affected seven countries and 9,216 people have been diagnosed with the virus. There are4,555 reported deaths so far.) A likely explanation for the difference this time has to do with where the virus struck, and not the nature of the disease itself. Accordingto a recent article in the New England Journal of Medicine, the latest outbreak started in Guinea in December 2013. That was a very unfortunate location with many residents and decent transportation.There are plenty of roads that allow the people in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia to move easily among the three countries and between rural areas and dense urban centers. But the research team that wrote the article said that the biological characteristics of the virus are largely the same. Quick and robust public health measures could have stopped the Ebola outbreak early, but the steps that were taken fell short. The critical determinant of epidemic size appears to be the speed of implementation of rigorous control measures, the article authors wrote. Our ruling Hebert said there have been 27 outbreaks of of Ebola and in no case did the disease spread to a second country. His number is high. A more accurate figure would be between 16 and 22. However, he is correct in his main point,that past efforts have successfully contained the disease. The combination of an exaggerated number and an accurate assessment of the importance of thepublic health response leads us to rate this claim Mostly True.",0.6,0.5,1.0,0.5,0.0,0.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,Mostly True

Final Rating: Mostly True  ",The average bridge in Missouri is 48 years old — most were only designed to last for 50 years.,"The Missouri Department of Transportations chronic lack of funding isnt very surprising anymore. Just last November, Missouri voters rejected Proposition D, which would have increased the states gas tax by 10 cents and used the funds to boost spending on roads and bridges. Without the additional funding, MoDOT counts on federal grant money to address infrastructure problems like the one posed by Missouris aging bridges. In his Aug. 29 newsletter, U.S. Rep. Sam Graves, R-Mo., announced that MoDOT will receive a $20.7 million federal grant for the states bridge replacement program. To highlight the significance of the challenges, Graves said, The average bridge in Missouri is 48 years old—most were only designed to last for 50 years. The problem sounds severe and a little dangerous, so we decided to see if the numbers hold up. To a degree, they do — Graves took the sentence from the MoDOT website. But that doesnt mean its time to panic every time you drive over a bridge. MoDOTs website confirms that the average age of Missouri bridges is 48 years old. An average takes into account all bridges from newly built ones to those much older than 48 years. So how old are Missouris oldest bridges? We dont know. State bridge engineer Dennis Heckman pointed out a lack of records before about 1900. About 40 bridges were built before 1909; they are at least 110 years old and might be even older. Heckman explained that design life doesnt mean a bridge closes or becomes unsafe on its 50th birthday. Intended design life is not a set expiration date. In reality, its more like a sell-by date that indicates when a bridges quality needs to be monitored more closely. When they reach that age, youre going to be maintaining them a lot more, fixing them a lot more, Heckman said. They just become a lot more high maintenance. Theres also some variation in the design life of Missouris bridges to take into account. For decades, Heckman said,a 50-year design life was standard, and about 8,000 of MoDOTs 10,400 bridges have a design life of 50 years. In the past 10 to 15 years, designing bridges with a 75-year life span has become more common; about 2,350 bridges were built to this standard. And longer, river-crossing bridges are built with a design life of 100 years. About 50 bridges currently fall into this 100-year design life category. In total, 6,000, or 60%, of Missouris bridges are past their intended design life, and Heckman said MoDOTs ability to extend the lifespan of these bridges is unique to each bridge and its specific conditions. But bridge condition, not intended design life, is what determines MoDOTs course of action. Federal law requires all publicly owned highway bridges over 20 feet long tobe inspected about once every two years, and currently, 909 of the bridges MoDOT inspects are rated poor by federal National Bridge Inspection Standards. Poor is the worst rating a bridge can receive and remain open for use. Poor bridges result in weight limits that hinder economic development and reduce Missourians safety, Heckman said. Heavier trucks cant use them. Farmers cant use them when theyre hauling their grain or hogs to market. So you end up with a lot of detours. He also said many bridges cannot support the weight of a school bus, firetruck, or ambulance. Most states strive to have only about 3% to 4% of their bridges ranked poor, Heckman said. Currently, 9% of Missouris bridges are poor. At our current funding levels, were basically treading water, said Bob Brendel, MoDOTs special assignments coordinator. Were basically repairing and replacing about as many bridges every year as fall into the poor category. Graves said, The average bridge in Missouri is 48 years old — most were only designed to last for 50 years. This statement comes directly from MoDOTs data on state bridges, but it needs a bit of clarification. Most bridges dont need to be replaced when they turn 50. Thats when engineers could expect them to need more maintenance. Condition, not design life, determines the death of a bridge",1.0,0.0,1.0,0.8,0.0,0.0,0.5,1.0,0.8,Mostly True

Final Rating: Mostly True  ","About 230,000 people that were on unemployment when I took office are not on unemployment now.","A radio host recently asked Gov. Rick Scott for an update on his trademark 7-7-7 plan -- creating 700,000 jobs in seven years in seven steps. (We're tracking that promise on the Scott-O-Meter.)Scott said Floridas economy is getting better in a lot of ways.Were doing well. Were at a three-year low on our unemployment in this state... We generated around 100,000 net jobs so far, if you look at the federal numbers, he said in the April 18, 2012, interview with Orlando-based station WDBO. But if you look at the state numbers, about 230,000 people that were on unemployment when I took office are not on unemployment now.When you look around the state, tourism is up, the home markets up, home sales are up, home prices are up.  So good things are happening, but we still have 900,000 people out of work, he said.What stuck out to us is his claim that 230,000 fewer people receive unemployment benefits than when he took office 15 months ago. That sounds like a drastic decrease, which Scott is taking credit for and in turn using as evidence that the states economy is improving.A spokeswoman with the states Department of Economic Opportunity, the agency that manages the unemployment compensation program, responded to our request about Scotts claim. Spokeswoman Nancy Blum said the number of people receiving unemployment compensation dropped from 561,736 on Jan. 31, 2011, to 345,052 on March 31, 2012. Thats a total decline of 216,684.Thats pretty close to about 230,000, which is the number Scott offered.Whether Scott is right to take credit for the decline -- and whether that is translating to a better Florida economy -- is more complicated.In 2011 and 2012, Scott and Florida lawmakers made a series of changes to the states unemployment compensation program that generally make it harder for people to receive benefits.Among them: Meanwhile, businesses got tax breaks. A 2012 bill reduces unemployment compensation taxes for businesses by at least $50 per employee, with savings of $276 million the first year.The Miami Workers Center asked the U.S. Department of Labors civil rights division to investigate Floridas unemployment compensation system over allegations that these changes act as barriers to people who deserve checks but cant get them for lack of computer access or reading skills. A Labor department spokesman told us the investigation is ongoing.The governors number in and of itself does not demonstrate any kind of economic recovery in Florida, said Valory Greenfield, staff attorney for Florida Legal Services, which represents the workers center. What it tells me based on our experience working with claimants is that fewer people who are potentially eligible are getting into the program.In fact, since August 2011 the department has denied 131,115 applicants for failing to comply with the new law, mostly for failing to fulfill the work search or the initial skills assessment.Those denials resulted in a $30.3 million savings. Economists said Scott's number, while accurate, isn't necessarily a great economic measure on its own. They also said it's too soon to tell if Florida's more stringent eligibility requirements play a big role in the declining number of recipients. Part of the drop-off could be attributed to people whose benefits have expired. Since December 2011, 30,600 people have exhausted all state and federal unemployment benefits, according to the department.So far I havent been able to see any hard data or evidence to quantify (either) effect, said Mekael Teshome, PNC Financial Services Group economist.Whats more relevant, Teshome said, is that jobless claims have been coming down since their peak in mid 2009, well before Scott took office. That somewhat undermines the idea that the drop is thanks to Scott. In fact, if you started counting in 2010 instead of 2011 when Scott took office, even fewer people -- 300,770 -- are receiving unemployment benefits. Some experts also pointed to the contracting size of the labor force, which helps to lower the unemployment rate but also indicates some people are no longer looking for work. About 15,000 people left the labor force from February, according to the states March 2012 labor report. The 15,000-person drop in the labor force was part of the reason why the unemployment rate fall from 9.4 percent in February to 9 percent in March.Some of those are people whose benefits ran out and are now not looking for work, said Chris McCarty, director of the University of Floridas Bureau of Economic and Business Research. Some of those are retirees who have left the labor force permanently.Our rulingScotts claim that 230,000 fewer people are receiving unemployment benefits than when he entered office is pretty close to the actual drop (216,684). A couple of caveats here. The figure is not completely an indicator that the economy is improving, as Scott suggests, and is somewhat the result of a strict new state law. Also, the trend of jobless claims started falling in mid 2009, more than a year before Scott took office. That undercuts, to a point, the suggestion Scott should get the credit. Scotts statement is accurate but can use some additional information. Thats our definition of Mostly True.",0.9,0.2,1.0,0.8,0.0,0.2,0.5,0.8,0.7,Mostly True

Final Rating: Mostly True  ","President-elect Trump's immigration policies are very similar to policies that are sitting right in the Senate and the House today to temporarily suspend immigration from countries that harbor terrorism, to temporarily suspend immigration from Syria until we get better vetting.","Reince Priebus, the chairman of the Republican National Committee and future chief of staff for President-elect Donald Trump, dismissed criticism that legislators from his party and Trump were at odds on a series of issues. During the presidential campaign, Trump disagreed with House Speaker Paul Ryan and other Republicans over mass deportations, trade, Social Security and Medicare, said Steve Rattner, a former adviser to President Barack Obama and an economic analyst on MSNBCs Morning Joe. How are you guys going to resolve those conflicts? Rattner asked Priebus on the Nov. 14 show. Well, there's not that many, the conflicts aren't as great as you're outlining, Priebus responded. President-elect Trump's immigration policies are very similar to policies that are sitting right in the Senate and the House today, to temporarily suspend immigration from countries that harbor terrorism, to temporarily suspend immigration from Syria until we get better vetting. That's not extreme, that's exactly what is in the House today. Is Priebus right? We decided to check whether there currently are immigration policies in Congress similar to Trumps proposals. Trumps immigration policies On the campaign trail, Trump promised to build a wall to stop illegal immigration and to be tough on people who violated immigration laws. While he was inconsistent about his plans for the estimated 11 million people in the country illegally, he was firm on deporting criminals. Trump also said he would limit legal immigration because immigration flows are too large to perform adequate screening. Trump repeatedly criticized his Democratic challenger, Hillary Clinton, for wanting to increase the number of refugees admitted into the United States from Syria, a country afflicted by terrorism. When I am elected, I will suspend immigration from areas of the world when there is a proven history of terrorism against the United States, Europe or our allies, until we understand how to end these threats, Trump said June 13, 2016. In December 2015, Trump called for a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our country's representatives can figure out what is going on. That comment came after a deadly attack in San Bernardino, Calif. In his 10-point immigration plan, Trump said he would suspend the issuance of visas to any place where adequate screening cannot occur, until proven and effective vetting mechanisms can be put into place. Congress policies We reached out to the Republican National Committee, chaired by Priebus, to find out which congressional policies specifically mirror Trumps immigration proposals. We did not get a response from the committee or from the House Republican Conference. So we did some digging on our own. A bill called the American SAFE Act of 2015 was introduced in the House a year ago, calling for additional screening of covered aliens, to ensure they are not a threat to national security. The bill defines a covered alien as a person applying for admission as a refugee and who is a national or resident of Iraq or Syria; has no nationality and whose last habitual residence was in Iraq or Syria; or has been present in Iraq or Syria at any time on or after March 1, 2011. Individuals cannot be admitted as refugees until the FBI director certifies to the Secretary of Homeland Security and to the National Intelligence director that background investigations sufficiently determined they are not a threat to national security, the bill said. A refugee may also only be admitted after the Secretary of Homeland Security -- in unanimous agreement with the directors of the FBI and National Intelligence -- certifies to 12 appropriate Congressional Committees that the person is not a national security threat. The American SAFE Act of 2015 was introduced by Rep. Michael T. McCaul, R-Texas, and co-sponsored by 102 Republicans and one Democrat. It passed the House Nov. 19, 2015, with a 289-137 vote and stalled in the Senate in January. Another House bill, Give States a Chance Act of 2015, was introduced November 2015 to allow governors to refuse the placement of Syrian refugees in their respective states if they certify they are not reasonably satisfied that the refugee does not pose a security threat. Under that bill, the governor could also refuse a refugee if he or she has not properly been informed of the intended sponsorship process for the refugee and if the governor determines that the proposed resettlement location is inappropriate because the proportion of refugees and comparable entrants in the area is too high. Thirteen Republicans co-sponsored the bill introduced by Rep. Ted S. Yoho, R-Fla. Its been referred to the House Subcommittee on Immigration and Border Security. This summer, Rep. Brian Babin (R-Texas) also introduced in the House the Resettlement Accountability National Security Prioritization Act of 2016, to suspend, and subsequently terminate, the admission of certain refugees. The bill is directed to nationals of Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Syria, and Yemen; or people who have no nationality and whose last habitual residence was in those specific countries. Forty-nine Republicans co-sponsored the bill, which would also evaluate the costs of benefits provided to refugees and their impact on national security. Babins bill to suspend admission of refugees sounds like what Priebus was talking about, said Steven Camarota, director of research at Center for Immigration Studies, a think tank favoring stricter immigration policies. Our ruling Priebus said, President-elect Trump's immigration policies are very similar to policies that are sitting right in the Senate and the House today, to temporarily suspend immigration from countries that harbor terrorism, to temporarily suspend immigration from Syria until we get better vetting. Trump's policies include ending sanctuary cities, deporting at least 2 million people and building a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border, not just restrictions on refugees. As for the restrictions, abill passed in the Housethat is designed to increase screening of potential refugees from Iraq and Syria. The bill also called for certifications that ensure potential refugees are not a threat to the security of the United States. But it has stalled in the Senate. Two otherHouse bills restricting the admission and resettlement of refugeeshave not been voted on either, so their outcome and support is still to be determined.",0.8,0.3,1.0,0.6,0.2,0.3,0.4,0.7,0.8,Mostly True

Final Rating: True",Says Donald Trump is on record extensively supporting (the) intervention in Libya.,"When it comes to national security, Republican Donald Trump casts Democrat Hillary Clinton as too ready to take the country into war. One of his prime examples -- Clintons full-throated support for the attacks that toppled Libyan dictator Muammar Gadhafi. But in a NBC News forum focused on the role of the commander-in-chief, Clinton deflected that criticism. She said there was no difference between herself and Trump on the Libyan action. He's on record extensively supporting intervention in Libya, when Gadhafi was threatening to massacre his population, Clinton said Sept. 7, 2016. Did Trump endorse the attacks to unseat Libyas then-leader, Moammar Gadhafi? The record shows he did. Early in 2011, before the United States joined a NATO force to oust Gadhafi, Trump argued for American action. We know what Trump thought back then thanks to a video on Trumps own video blog (credit to BuzzFeed for spotting it) I cant believe what our country is doing, Trump said, according to the BuzzFeed transcript. Gadhafi in Libya is killing thousands of people, nobody knows how bad it is, and were sitting around. We have soldiers all overthe Middle East, and were not bringing them in to stop this horrible carnage and thats what it is: Its a carnage. Trump continued. You talk about things that have happened in history; this could be one of the worst, he said. Now we should go in, we should stop this guy, which would be very easy and very quick. We could do it surgically, stop him from doing it, and save these lives. This is absolutely nuts. We dont want to get involved and youre gonna end up with something like youve never seen before. And then ... But we have go in to save these lives; these people are being slaughtered like animals, Trump said. Its horrible whats going on; it has to be stopped. We should do on a humanitarian basis, immediately go into Libya, knock this guy out very quickly, very surgically, very effectively, and save the lives. Trump offered a more mixed assessment on CNN after the attacks began. His primary concern was with the political leanings of the forces opposing Gadhafi. I do really want to know who these people we're fighting for, who they are, Trump said on March 28, 2011. I hear they are aligned with Iran. I hear they may be aligned with al-Qaida. But Trump still said, At this point, if you don't get rid of Gadhafi, it's a major, major black eye for this country. Our ruling Clinton said Trump is on record extensively supporting the attacks that unseated Libyas Gadhafi. We actually didnt find that many comments from Trump about Libya. But when he did speak, he was emphatic. In 2011, before the first bombing runs, Trump said, We should go in, we should stop this guy. Even when he voiced concern over who would run Libya post-Gadhafi, he supported the intervention. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/06e4eaf5-2b03-451c-9282-da80ca345d38",1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,True

Final Rating: Mostly True  ","Traditionally, presidential candidates release their tax returns . . . Mitt Romney still wont.","More than one political opponent has attempted to make an issue of Mitt Romneys personal fortune.Romneys years leading the private equity firm Bain Capital — which sometimes made money by laying off workers and closing businesses it had acquired — have led to charges that he is a creature of Wall Street and disconnected from the lives of average Americans.According to the financial disclosure required of all presidential candidates by the Federal Election Commission, Romneys personal fortune is between $190 million and $250 million. All presidential aspirants are required to file Office of Government Ethics Form 278 with the Federal Election Commission.Details about Romneys wealth are scarce, however, because he is only required to fill out the standard disclosure form about his assets. And unlike some past and present presidential candidates, Romney has not released his income tax returns during this campaign or in previous races for state and federal office.Another GOP contender, Texas Gov. Rick Perry, has called on Romney to go beyond the legal requirements and release his tax returns. Perry released his own returns in October 2011.The Democratic National Committee raised the tax return issue in a video released earlier this month, What Is Mitt Romney Hiding?In it, the DNC makes the point that Romneys father, then-Michigan Gov. George Romney, released his tax returns during the 1968 primary campaign when he sought the Republican presidential nomination. George Romney put pressure on his opponents by releasing 12 years of income tax returns in November 1967.The DNC narrator states in the video: Traditionally, presidential candidates release their tax returns. ... Mitt Romney still wont.So, do presidential candidates really have a tradition of releasing their tax returns? And has Mitt Romney refused to do so?What constitutes a tradition?In the post-Watergate era, many, but not all, primary candidates have released their personal tax returns, in some cases going back decades. Here's a sampling of some recent elections, based on news coverage, publicly available returns and a list put together by Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, a group that promotes ethics and accountability. Presidents and vice presidents routinely release their returnsin office.2008 Tax returns were an issue in the 2008 primary campaign. Sen. Barack Obama went first, releasing returns dating back to 2000 in March 2008. Sen. Hillary Clinton waited until April to release tax records dating back to 2000 for herself and former President Bill Clinton. Sen. Chris Dodd, D-Conn., also released tax returns during the primary, but Joe Biden didnt release his returns until September, when Obama selected him as a running mate. John Edwards did not release tax returns, though he had released a decade of returns in September 2004, when he became John Kerrys running mate.Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., who eventually won the Republican nomination, released his individual tax returns in April. Cindy McCain, his wife, initially refused but then released summaries for 2006 and 2007.Romney declined to release returns, as did former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee and former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani, who both had released tax returns during earlier runs for state and municipal office.2004All the major Democratic contenders for the nomination released at least one year of tax returns, a list that included Kerry and Edwards, as well as Wesley Clark, Howard Dean, Richard Gephardt, Dennis Kucinich and Joseph Lieberman.2000George W. Bush largely cleared the GOP field early in the primary season. He and running mate Richard Cheney were the only Republicans to release returns. Vice President Al Gore and his chief rival for the Democratic nomination, then-U.S. Sen. Bill Bradley, of New Jersey, both released returns as well. Ralph Nader, whose third party candidacy played a crucial role in deciding the outcome of the general election, did not release his returns.1996Among GOP primary candidates in 1996, Sens. Bob Dole, Lamar Alexander and Jack Kemp released their tax returns. Publisher Steve Forbes, columnist Pat Buchanan and Sen. Richard Lugar did not.1992In April of that year, Bill Clinton released tax returns dating back to 1980. His closest rival for the nomination, former California governor Jerry Brown, did not.1988The top two Democrats in the race to face Vice President Bush, Michael Dukakis and Jesse Jackson, both released returns.1984The controversy over tax returns fell on the vice presidential candidates when Geraldine Ferraro and her husband, John Zaccaro, acquiesced to pressure and released their individual tax returns. After they did, the couple ended up paying more than $50,000 in back taxes.1980President Ronald Reagan, who like Romney had refused to release his tax returns during previous campaigns for state and federal office, relented in August and released his tax returns for 1979 after it became clear he was the likely nominee. Reagans chief rival for the 1980 nomination, George H.W. Bush, had released his in April, pressuring Reagan to do the same.1976Jimmy Carter and President Gerald Ford both released their 1975 tax returns and it was noted that an investment tax credit signed into law by Ford resulted in a significant tax windfall for a peanut warehouse owned by Carter.Is it true that Romney wont release his tax returns?Romneys camp did not respond to questions about if and when he would release his income tax returns. In response to the question when the Perry camp raised the issue, a Romney spokeswoman said the campaign would revisit the question during the next tax-filing season, presumably in April.Our RulingOf 34 presidential and vice presidential candidates reviewed above, only seven -- Brown, Buchanan, Huckabee, Forbes, Giuliani, Lugar, Nader -- declined to release personal tax returns. So while most follow the practice, not all do.",1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.5,1.0,1.0,Mostly True

Final Rating: Half True  ",This bill allows Virginia to join about 23 other states that have an ultrasound procedure before an abortion.,"During a rapid-fire exchange on Meet the Press earlier this month, Gov. Bob McDonnell rejected host David Gregorys contention that the legislation puts Virginia in a socially conservative corner.This bill allows Virginia to join about 23 other states that have an ultrasound procedure, said McDonnell, a Republican.Its actually only about seven that have these kind of procedures, Gregory interrupted.No, but theres 23 that require a woman to have an opportunity to see an ultrasound, McDonnell replied.We wondered if the governors number is correct.Debate over Virginias law this winter became a national story when it became clear that the measure would require use of an invasive, transvaginal ultrasound -- even against a womans will.At McDonnells urging, the Republican-led General Assembly eventually passed a toned-down measure mandating that women, at least 24 hours before an abortion, undergo a common abdominal ultrasound in which an imaging wand is rubbed across the stomach. The patient must be offered an opportunity to view the image and hear the fetal heartbeat. Victims of rape and incest are exempt from the law if the molestation or assault was reported to legal authorities.Taylor Thornley, a spokeswoman for McDonnell, said the governor got his statistics about other states from separate studies by two groups that seldom agree: The Guttmacher Institute, a research and advocacy organization that supports womens access to birth control and abortions; and the National Right to Life Committee, which opposes abortion. Neither groups research includes Virginias law, which will become effective July 1.The National Right to Life Committee lists 23 states that have an ultrasound option and gives a brief description of each law.Guttmacher lists 21 states with ultrasound laws, including seven that mandate the test be performed before an abortion. Unlike the National Right to Life Committee, Guttmacher does not count North Carolina and Oklahoma, where the mandatory ultrasound laws have been stayed pending court challenges.Guttmacher shows the wide range of laws: North Carolina and Oklahoma would fit into that final category if not for the court challenges. In the meantime, those states and Wisconsin require that women be given information on how to access ultrasounds. (Utah requires both that the woman be offered an ultrasound and that if the procedure is performed to prepare for the abortion, the woman is offered an opportunity to view the image.)So the state requirements range from giving women information on accessing ultrasounds to requiring abortion providers to give ultrasounds and display and describe the image.Elizabeth Nash, state issues manager at the institute, said once Virginias law goes into effect in July, it will be listed as requiring an ultrasound before an abortion and that the provider must offer to show the woman the image.Our rulingMcDonnell, in a carefully worded statement, said the bill he recently signed allows Virginia to join about 23 other states that have an ultrasound procedure before allowing abortions. It is technically correct that 23 states have passed legislation that at least requires women be offered information on how to get ultrasounds before abortions.But the governor, in implying Virginia has adopted a mainstream law on ultrasounds, omitted a contradicting fact: Virginia will join only nine states that have passed mandatory ultrasound bills. And the enforcement of the laws in two of those states has been delayed by legal challenges. While McDonnell is accurate in saying 23 states have laws that deal with ultrasounds, his claim creates a misleading impression by not acknowledging only nine states require the procedure.",0.5,0.5,1,0.5,0,0,0.5,1,0.5,Half True

Final Rating: Mostly True  ","In 99 percent of counties in America, someone making the minimum wage working full time cant afford a 1-bedroom apartment.","Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., has recently made it a point to support affordable housing, both in her social media posts and in the legislation she brings before Congress. On July 19, Harris introduced the Rent Relief Act to Congress, which would provide assistance in the form of a refundable tax credit to those who make under $100,000 a year and spend more than 30 percent of their income on housing. To rally support for the bill, she tweeted, In 99 percent of counties in America, someone making the minimum wage working full time cant afford a 1-bedroom apartment. She later posted a video that expressed a similar sentiment and repeated the statistic.  In 99% of counties in America, someone making the minimum wage working full time cant afford a 1-bedroom apartment. That is outrageous. I've just introduced the Rent Relief Act, so that Americans who spend over 30% of their income on rent can get a portion of that money back. We decided to look into Harriss statement. Aside from a few minor caveats, the statement is largely accurate. Out of reach? We began by reaching out to Harriss press secretary, who directed us to a 2017 study published by the National Low Income Housing Coalition titled Out of Reach. The study is updated yearly, and the 2018 edition is out. Harriss press secretary pointed out a line from the latest study that reads, In only 22 counties out of more than 3,000 counties nationwide can a full-time minimum wage worker afford a one-bedroom rental home at fair market rent. That statistic and the coalitions report overall have been cited by various news outlets. Do the math, and youll see that 22 divided by 3,000 comes out to a figure slightly smaller than 1 percent. That small percentage refers to the counties where a one-bedroom home is affordable for minimum-wage workers. But there are two concepts in the sentence from the study that require further clarification: affordability and fair market rent. The national coalition defines affordability as consistent with the federal standard that no more than 30 percent of a households gross income should be spent on rent and utilities. Thats the same guideline used by the Department of Housing and Urban Development, and we found its a standard threshold within the field. The definition of fair market rent is slightly different. It also has its origins from HUD. The National Low Income Housing Coalition defines it as typically the 40th percentile of gross rents for standard rental units. So that means that within any given metropolitan area, 40 percent of all rental properties are priced equal to or below the fair market rent threshold. That means not all units within the 99 percent of counties referred to in Harriss tweet are unaffordable for full-time minimum-wage workers, but it does mean that a majority — 60 percent — are. Of the remaining 40 percent of one-bedroom housing, some units may be affordable for those workers, but that doesnt mean theyll be quality apartments — they might be in a high-crime area or low-performing school district, for example. (We previously cleared up the definition of fair market rent in a fact-check of a Facebook graphic.) As Vincent Reina, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania School of Design, put it, It does not mean there are 0 affordable units (in the 99% of counties that Harris is referring to), it means that there are none affordable at or above the 40th percentile of the rent distribution. There are likely some units that are affordable, just not even close to enough.  The experts we reached out to pointed out that the conclusions reached by the National Low Income Housing Coalition are supported by other research, including a recent study published by the Joint Center of Housing Studies of Harvard University. Not all the studies would support the exact claim that 99 percent of counties in the U.S. are unaffordable, but theres a lot of evidence that the poorest families (say the bottom 20-25 percent) are financially stretched to afford unsubsidized housing, said Jenny Schuetz, a David M. Rubenstein Fellow in the Metropolitan Policy Program at the Brookings Institution. Our ruling Harris recently tweeted, In 99 percent of counties in America, someone making the minimum wage working full time cant afford a 1-bedroom apartment. She was referring to a recent study by the National Low Income Housing Coalition, which shows that in only 22 counties out of more than 3,000 counties nationwide can a full-time minimum wage worker afford a one-bedroom rental home at fair market rent. Harris didnt refer to the concept of fair market rent, which is defined as the 40th percentile of gross rents for standard rental units. The underlying study she referenced doesnt say that a minimum wage worker cant afford any housing in almost all of the United States, but that a minimum wage worker cant afford the average-priced housing unit. With that said, Harriss claim is still a largely accurate characterization of the magnitude of the rent affordability problems that many people face. ",0.8,0.5,1.0,0.7,0.3,0.5,0.6,1.0,0.7,Mostly True

Final Rating: True  ",The federal government only ordered BP to pay to do one of those six segments of sand barriers for Louisiana.,"Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal lamented the federal response to the state's plans to erect sand barriers to keep oil out of marshlands in the wake of the Deepwater Horizon disaster.Jindal talked about a meeting he had had with President Obama where Jindal explained what the state wanted from the feds.The area we spent the most time was on our plan, the state's plan, to build sand booms to keep this oil out of our wetlands. Now, we have said for weeks now we'd much rather fight this oil on a sandy barrier island than fighting inside our wetlands. We've got miles and miles of these islands that have been eroded by Katrina, by storms, and over time. We proposed a plan, 24 segments, to rebuild, to refortify these islands. After weeks -- and if they'd approved this when we first asked, we could have built 10 miles, 10 miles of sand barriers.Host Jake Tapper interjected here: The president says that more is not always better, and the Army Corps of Engineers took the request seriously, evaluated it, decided it was okay for certain areas, but they didn't necessarily think immediately the plan that was suggested was the right plan. Is that not a fair response?Yesterday, the Army Corps of Engineers approved 6 segments out of 24, over 40 miles out of 100, Jindal replied. But here's where our concern was: The federal government only ordered BP to pay for to do one of those six segments. That's 2 miles out of 100. Our message to the president today was: Make BP pay for this. The federal government shouldn't be making excuses for BP. This is their spill, their oil. They're the responsible party. Make them responsible.We wanted to check Jindal's claim that the federal government only ordered BP to pay to do one of those six segments. The Obama administration has said over and over that the oil company BP will pay for the clean up, and we wondered how to reconcile that with Jindal's statements.It turns out that Jindal is right about BP paying for one of six segments of sand barriers, but there's more to the story. As Tapper's comment suggested, the feds aren't so keen on the idea of building sand berms. Federal agencies are chiefly concerned that they can't be constructed quickly enough to intercept the oil, and that they will divert money and attention from other efforts.Nevertheless, on Thursday, May 27, 2010, U.S. Coast Guard Admiral Thad Allen said the government would give permission for the construction of six barriers and authorize BP to pay for one, as a test to see if the barrier plan is feasible. That one barrier would cost $16 million and be paid for by BP or the federal Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund.Louisiana's original proposal called for the dredging of more than 92 million cubic yards of material over a six to nine month period to build temporary barrier islands, said a statement issued by the Deepwater Horizon Unified Command. The group approved a more limited project because implementation of the proposal in all areas approved by the Army Corps of Engineers, in the midst of an active spill, would not be prudent or provide effective protection—especially considering the complications of a major construction project occurring in the midst of a response encompassing more than 20,000 personnel and 1,300 vessels.The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers listed 33 separate conditions that had to be met, including protections for navigation channels and wildlife.Allen said the approval was meant as a test case. There are a lot of doubts whether this is a valid oil spill response technique, given the length of construction and so forth, he said. But we're not averse to attempting this as a prototype. Some environmentalists also criticized initial proposals for dredging sand for the barriers too close to shore, according to a report in the Times-Picayune newspaper. After changes were made to address those concerns, the cost estimates for the barriers rose from $250 million to $350 million.The state government could move to build the barriers with state money, but Jindal has rejected that idea without a guarantee of reimbursement.So Jindal is right that the federal government has authorized payment for only one of six barriers. But he leaves out the fact that the government has doubts about the plan and whether it will work or not, and the first barrier is meant as a test case.",1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,True

Final Rating: Half True  ","In Chicago, school is never canceled because of winter weather.","A veteran of many frosty winters in the Windy City, President Obama was incredulous to find out that classes at his daughters' new schools in Washington, D.C., had been canceled due to icy road conditions.Can I make a comment that is unrelated to the economy very quickly? Obama told reporters in a light moment at a gathering with business leaders on Jan. 28. And it has to do with Washington. My children's school was canceled today. Because of, what? Some ice?As my children pointed out, in Chicago, school is never canceled, Obama said. In fact, my 7-year-old pointed out that (during a winter storm) you'd go outside for recess. You wouldn't even stay indoors. So, I don't know. We're going to have to try to apply some flinty Chicago toughness.According to an AP report, Obama was asked if he meant the people of the national's capital are wimps, to which Obama responded: I'm saying, when it comes to the weather, folks in Washington don't seem to be able to handle things. Chicago gets an average of about 3 feet of snow a year. Is it possible they don't need snow days? Turns out it's been 10 years. The last time we had a snow day was on Jan. 4 and 5 of 1999, said Malon Edwards, spokesman for the Chicago Public Schools. That's when the Windy City got socked with 22 inches of snow, at the time the second-largest snowstorm in Chicago history. We very rarely cancel for snow days. In mid January of this year, when temperatures dipped into negative numbers (sans wind chill), the school district told parents if they felt it was unsafe to send their kids to school that day, it'd be okay to keep them at home. But school stayed open. We should note that D.C. public schools weren't actually closed on Jan. 28. They opened two hours late. But Obama's daughters, Malia and Sasha, attend the private Sidwell Friends School, which canceled classes. Most school districts in the Washington suburbs also closed. Obama is right that snow days are amazingly rare in Chicago — there haven't been any in the last decade — but we'll cruelly ding him for saying never. Mostly True.

Final Rating: Mostly True  ",A strong majority of Americans support the Keystone XL pipeline.,"See editor's note below During the Republican response to President Barack Obamas 2015 State of the Union address, newly elected Sen. Joni Ernst of Iowa urged bipartisan cooperation to pass a longstanding agenda item for Republicans and some Democrats -- the Keystone XL pipeline. The project has been in the works since 2008, and its current version involves a 875-mile pipeline that would run from Morgan, Mont., to Steele City, Neb. Building this link would allow 830,000 barrels of oil per day to move from the tar sands fields in Alberta, Canada, to refineries on the Gulf Coast. Opponents of the pipeline say it will increase greenhouse gas emissions and increase the risk of water pollution from spills. Supporters speak of improved energy security and jobs, and blame the Obama administration for stalling what they consider critical infrastructure supported by many business leaders and labor unions. Heres what Ernst said during her State of the Union response on Jan. 20, 2015. The new Republican majority you elected started by reforming Congress to make it function again. And now, were working hard to pass the kind of serious job-creation ideas you deserve. One youve probably heard about is the Keystone jobs bill.  President Obama has been delaying this bipartisan infrastructure project for years, even though many members of his party, unions, and a strong majority of Americans support it. The Presidents own State Department has said Keystones construction could support thousands of jobs and pump billions into our economy, and do it with minimal environmental impact. We wondered whether Ernst was correct when she said that a strong majority of Americans support the pipeline. So we looked at the polling data. At the survey curation site pollingreport.com, we found five polls taken since May 2014 that asked questions that shed light on Ernsts claim. Well start with the four polls that asked the question in its most basic form -- whether the respondent favors or opposes construction of the pipeline: • CBS News, Jan. 9-12, 2015. Do you favor or oppose building the Keystone XL pipeline that would transport oil from Canada through the United States to refineries in Texas? Favor: 60 percent. Oppose: 28 percent. Unsure or no answer: 12 percent. (Margin of error ± 3 percent.) • USA Today/Princeton Survey Research Associates International, Nov. 13-16, 2014. Should Congress and President Obama approve construction of the Keystone XL pipeline that would transport oil from Canada's oil sands region through the Midwest to refineries in Texas, or not? Yes: 60 percent. No: 25 percent. Unsure: 14 percent. (Margin of error ± 3.6 percent.) • Pew Research Center, Nov. 6-9, 2014. Do you favor or oppose building the Keystone XL pipeline that would transport oil from Canada's oil sands region through the Midwest to refineries in Texas? Favor: 59 percent. Oppose: 31 percent. Unsure/refused: 10 percent. (Margin of error ± 3.1 percent.) • CBS News, May 16-19, 2014. Do you favor or oppose building the Keystone XL pipeline that would transport oil from Canada through the United States to refineries in Texas? Favor: 56 percent. Oppose: 28 percent. Unsure/No answer: 17 percent. For these four polls, support for the pipeline held steady in a very narrow band, from 56 percent to 60 percent. So Ernst has a strong case to make. The only caveat stems from the fifth poll, which asked the question in a somewhat different way. An ABC News/Washington Post poll taken between Jan. 12 and Jan. 15, 2015, phrased the question this way: Obama has said he won't decide whether to approve a new oil pipeline from Canada to Texas until a review has determined whether it is in the national interest. The Republicans in Congress are working on a law to authorize the pipeline without Obama's approval. Which side do you support? Should the pipeline be authorized now, or should the review be completed before deciding? Asked the question this way, respondents were less sanguine about the approach being taken by the Republican Congress of which Ernst is now part: 34 percent said the pipeline should be authorized without Obamas approval, while 61 percent said that the review should be completed first. (Another 2 percent said they opposed the pipeline outright, but that answer was only tallied when volunteered, not because it was given as an option.) In other words, the polls show strong and consistent public support for building the pipeline, but one poll suggests it's only after completing full reviews of its merits. Our ruling Ernst said that a strong majority of Americans support the Keystone XL pipeline. Shes right that between 56 percent and 60 percent of the public has consistently supported the project when asked outright whether it should be built. However, one poll found public concern about building it before reviews are complete -- a stance more in tune with Obama than with Republican leaders. EDITORS NOTE, Jan. 21, 2015: After this article appeared, a reader pointed out another poll that had addressed public support for the Keystone XL pipeline that had been released the same day we published the story. A NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll taken in January 2015 asked respondents whether they favored or opposed building the pipeline, or whether they did not know enough about this topic to have an opinion. The inclusion of that last phrase increased the dont know response beyond that found in most other polls, to 37 percent. Of those who did have an opinion, 41 percent favored building Keystone XL and 20 percent opposed it. Because that's generally in line with what we found in the other polls, our original rating of Mostly True stands.",1.0,0.0,1.0,0.8,0.0,0.0,0.5,1.0,0.8,Mostly True

Final Rating: Mostly True","Theres already 10,000 businesses that are not likely to open again, and a significant number of small businesses and minority businesses.","Arriving in face masks and sitting far apart from each other, Joe Biden and former President Barack Obama sat down for their first in-person meeting since the COVID-19 outbreak. A 15-minute video released by Bidens presidential campaign shows the two men venting about the current handling of the pandemic and reliving their accomplishments over eight years in the White House. They talked about health care access, the summers protests against racial inequality and police brutality, and the pandemics effect on American businesses. Theres already 10,000 businesses that are not likely to open again, Biden said, and a significant number of small businesses and minority businesses. The shuttering of 10,000 businesses over a few months is bleak enough. But Biden actually underestimated the pandemics toll — by a lot. The Biden campaign told PolitiFact that Biden intended to say 100,000 small businesses were lost, not 10,000. That tracks with a study by researchers at Harvard, the University of Illinois and the University of Chicago, which estimated that over 100,000 small businesses permanently shut down between early March and early May. The data does indicate that Black- and minority-owned businesses have suffered at significant rates. Economists told us its difficult to gauge which businesses closed for good, especially in the middle of an unyielding pandemic. Temporary closure and permanent closure are very different, said Tara Sinclair, an associate professor in economics and international affairs at George Washington University, and identifying the excess businesses that close due to COVID-19 can be tricky, particularly when focused on small businesses, because small businesses, especially young small businesses, frequently close. Only about two-thirds of businesses with employees survive at least two years, and only about half survive at least five years, according to the Small Business Administration. And thats without a pandemic. Bryan Stuart, an assistant professor of economics at George Washington University, said that while the 10,000 figure is likely a sizable underestimate, measuring closures, even without attempting to distinguish between whether they are permanent or temporary, is difficult. The research study that estimated 100,000 lost businesses was based on data collected from weekly surveys by Alignable, a network for small business owners. These surveys are valuable because they can be very timely, but an important limitation is that the survey frames, and the businesses within those frames that respond to surveys are usually not representative of all types of business across the U.S., Stuart said. Another estimate of closure announcements comes from Yelp, an advertising platform for local businesses. Yelp found that about 132,500 businesses closed between March 1 and July 10. Of those, Yelp says nearly 72,850 are believed to be permanent closures. One caveat with Yelps data is that it is not representative of all employers or all small businesses, Stuart said. The number of Black business owners plummeted from 1.1 million in February 2020 to 640,000 in April, according to a June 2020 report published by the National Bureau of Economic Research. The loss of 440,000 black business owners representing 41% of the previous level is disconcerting, wrote study author Robert W. Fairlie, an economics professor at the University of California Santa Cruz. The report, which was based on Census data, found that the shutdown disproportionately affected Black Americans, but also hit other minority businesses hard: Latino business owners fell by 32%, and Asian business owners dropped by 26%. The long-term effect could be problematic on several fronts, Fairlie wrote, worsening wealth inequality and the availability of local jobs. Stuart also referenced the NBER report, and said that among those who are self-employed, minorities have lost more work. The data indicates that COVID-19 is affecting a significant number of minority-owned businesses, he said, but doesnt tell us whether business closures are permanent or temporary. Biden said 10,000 businesses likely wont reopen due to COVID-19, and that the health crisis is significantly affecting small and minority-owned businesses. Thats true, although the problem is substantially worse than he described. Bidens campaign said he intended to say 100,000 businesses, a figure that lines up with recent research. Biden is right that Black and minority-owned small businesses have been disproportionately affected by the economic crisis brought on by the pandemic, according to census data research. Bidens claim is accurate — 10,000 businesses are certainly unlikely to reopen — but the caveat is a lot more businesses will also likely close.",0.7,0.3,1.0,0.5,0.2,0.1,0.4,1.0,0.6,Mostly True

Final Rating: Half True",When I talk about (raising the) minimum wage ... half of Republicansagree with it.,"One of President Barack Obamas signature issues at the moment is a push to raise the minimum wage from $7.25 per hour to $10.10 per hour. Its such a popular policy, he said in a speech on March 5, 2014, that even Republicans have little quarrel with it. When I talk about (raising the) minimum wage, Obama said, not only is it good policy, but the majority of the country, including half of Republicans, agree with it. We wondered whether polling data backed up this claim. So we looked at independent polls taken recently that asked about the minimum wage. A review of the polling data suggests a more nuanced situation than Obamas claim suggests. Our first look at the data showed that a minimum-wage hike is popular among Americans broadly. For instance, when the CBS News-New York Times poll asked, Do you favor or oppose raising the minimum wage to $10.10? in February 2014, the poll found 65 percent support. And that was actually down a bit from the 72 percent support registered in the January edition of the poll. Similarly, a Pew Research Center/USA Today poll from January asked whether respondents supported an increase in the minimum wage from $7.25 to $10.10 an hour and found 73 percent support. But what about Republicans specifically? More than half of Republicans favor a minimum-wage increase, polls found, but in most of these polls, less than half of Republicans supported raising the wage to $10.10, the amount Obama is seeking. One poll that did not specify a target amount for the minimum-wage hike was conducted by Quinnipiac University. It asked, Would you support or oppose raising the national minimum wage, which is now $7.25 an hour? Among Republicans, 52 percent expressed support, while 45 percent said they opposed it. That provides some support to Obamas claim. But once respondents were asked by other pollsters about the $10.10 figure -- a roughly 40 percent increase from todays federal minimum wage -- Republican support sagged. The clearest example is a CBS-New York Times poll from February that asked, As you may know, the federal minimum wage is currently $7.25 an hour. Do you favor or oppose raising the minimum wage to $10.10? Republicans expressed 42 percent support, 54 percent opposition. Another clear example was an ABC News-Washington Post poll from December, 2013 that asked, The minimum wage in this country is now $7.25 an hour. What do you think it should be? Among Republicans, only 21 percent favored keeping it the same or lowering it, but even fewer respondents -- 7 percent -- favored a minimum wage in excess of $10. Two other polls showed Republican support close to 50 percent, but falling just short. However, the differences were within the margin of sampling error -- it's possible that more than half of Republicans were in support of a $10.10 wage, though also possible that the actual support level was even lower than the official result. A CBS-New York Times poll from January that asked the same question as the February poll found that Republicans expressed 48 percent support, 51 percent opposition to a $10.10 wage. And an NBC News-Wall Street Journal poll from December 2013 asked, I'm going to mention a number of different amounts and for each one, please tell me if you strongly favor, somewhat favor, somewhat oppose, or strongly oppose raising the hourly minimum wage to that amount. When presented with the $10.10 rate, 47 percent of Republicans expressed support. One poll clearly supported Obamas position. The January Pew Research Center/USA Today poll found 53 percent of Republicans backing a $10.10 minimum wage, with 43 percent opposed. The significance of the $10.10 figure is not academic. According to a March 6 account in the Washington Post, early last year, White House strategists rejected (the $10.10 figure), worried that it could destroy jobs and anger the business community just as the regulation-heavy Affordable Care Act was about to take effect. Instead, former officials say, the White House settled on a more cautious path,unveiling a $9-an-hour minimum wage proposal — a target even lower than Obamahad proposed during the 2008 campaign. However, the Post reported, the lower amount disappointed advocates for the working poor, as well as congressional Democrats, who were already pushing to set the $7.25 wage closer to $10 an hour. Over the past year, Obama reconsidered, casting off initial concerns in favor of unifying his party ahead of this falls midterm elections. In other words, White House officials had long realized there was a difference in the degree of public support for a $10.10 minimum wage and a smaller hike, so it would be misleading for Obama to now imply that majority Republican support for an unspecified minimum-wage hike means that Republicans automatically support the presidents proposal to raise the wage to $10.10. Our ruling Obama said,When I talk about (raising the) minimum wage ... half of Republicansagree with it.Republicans do support a minimum-wage hike if you don't specify a dollar figure. But once you mention the $10.10 target Obama wants, his case gets shakier.",0.5,0.5,1,0.5,0,0.5,0.5,1,0.5,Half True

Final Rating: Half True  ",We now actually import more oil than we did before 9/11.,"During a June 6, 2010, appearance on ABC's This Week, Sen. John Kerry -- who is sponsoring a comprehensive energy bill -- discussed the nation's energy future against the backdrop of the ongoing oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico.During an interview with host Jake Tapper, Kerry said, Here's what's important -- not to be throwing the blame around, but to put America on the course to true energy independence and self-reliance and to begin to wean ourselves from our addiction to oil. ... The United States is losing a major economic transformational moment. Until we begin to do something -- you know, since 9/11, we now actually import more oil than we did before 9/11. It's insulting to common sense.We decided to check whether Kerry was correct about whether the United States imports more oil today than it did before the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001.The answer is complicated, because there are at least three possible ways to measure it.• The number of barrels of crude oil imported. The U.S. imported 3.32 billion barrels of crude oil in 2000 and 3.40 billion barrels in 2001. Both figures were higher than the number imported in 2009 -- 3.31 billion barrels.By this measure, Kerry is incorrect, although just slightly. • Imported crude oil compared to domestic production. We wondered whether importedcrude oil was still increasing as a percentage of all oil in the U.S., even as it dropped in absolute amounts. In fact, that's exactly what happened.In 2000, oil imports accounted for 61 percent of the total of imports and domestic production, and in 2001, imports accounted for 62 percent. In 2009, the percentage of imports was 63 percent -- slightly higher than it was in either of those years. The underlying cause was that domestic oil production declined between the start of the decade and the end.By this measure, Kerry is correct, though once again, the difference is modest.• Imported crude oil plus imported unfinished oils. William Brown, who analyzes energy data for the federal government's Energy Information Administration, told PolitiFact that in recent years, there's been a rise in imports of unfinished oils, which are partially refined, taking the place of pure crude oil imports. So he sent us data that combined those two sets of imports.In 2000, the combination of crude oil and unfinished oils accounted for 9.54 million barrels per day, and in 2001, they accounted for 9.71 million barrels per day. In 2009, that figure was 9.86 million barrels per day.Adding in unfinished oils to the previous measure of crude oil turns an incorrect statement into a correct one.Bottom line: There are three ways to analyze the question, and with two of them, Kerry is right that imports have grown. Using the other statistic, he's wrong -- imports have declined.",0.5,0.5,1,0.5,0,0.5,0.5,1,0.5,Half True

Final Rating: Mostly True  ",The Convention Center was sold as a building that would never cost taxpayers a dime.,"State Rep. Patricia Morgan of late has repeatedly criticized the states financial support for the Rhode Island Convention Center Authority, asserting that the entity has cost taxpayers more than $450 million, even though it was never supposed to cost them a dime. Last week, the West Warwick Republican, who represents a group calling itself the Republican Policy Group, convened a press conference and unveiled an investigative report on the subsidies, which totaled more than $30 million last year. This included $23 million for debt service. Seriously, Morgan said, it was sold as a building that would never cost taxpayers a dime and it continues to cost us money. Year after year, state budgets show, in addition to paying off the convention centers debt -- its mortgage, so to speak -- the taxpayers have kicked in subsidies to keep the authority afloat. Since 1994, the state has allocated in excess of $450 million to the authority, which runs the Dunkin Donuts Center and Veterans Memorial Auditorium in addition to the convention center. Thats a big number and it made us wonder: Did someone really say this facility would never cost taxpayers a dime? If so, what were they talking about? So we asked Morgan for her sources. We also searched through The Journals archives and found someone who had made just such a statement -- Richard M. Oster. Oster, the heir of a family metals enterprise, had risen to the loftiest heights of the business world, serving as the chairman of the London-based Cookson Group PLC, a multinational company. In 1987, then-Gov. Edward DiPrete installed Oster as chairman of the Rhode Island Convention Center Authority. This made him the front man in 1989 for the campaign to sell the public on the need for a convention center, which was expected to cost $225 million. It was to be one of the largest economic development projects in Rhode Islands history. Oster told The Journal such a facility would bring 500,000 visitors a year to the city, pump $60 million to $100 million per year into the economy and generate enough new tax revenue -- via hotel, income, sales and property taxes -- to offset the deficit from construction and operations. This wont cost the taxpayers one dime, Oster said in 1989. That was his clincher, the line he used after detailing a list of economic benefits.  Morgan told us this was the quote she had in mind in her attack on the convention centers finances. Morgan, however, did not talk about how Oster and the other proponents claimed that new tax revenue would make up for the taxpayers costs. Morgans repeated emphasis on costs without discussing new tax revenues drew criticism from Joseph R. Paolino Jr., the former mayor and another champion of the convention center. I think shes wrong, Paolino said. I dont think she truly understands the concept of the convention center and what a convention center is supposed to do for a community. Paolino, who refers to the late Oster as one of the leading business giants of our community, says any analysis of convention center appropriations must consider tax revenue generated by convention center activity. This is the real story, he says. He acknowledged that he doesnt know how Osters projections worked out. But last week the Authority said its experts calculate that the convention center, the Dunkin Donuts Center and Veterans Memorial Auditorium have an average annual impact totaling $135 million and generate $10 million in state and local tax revenue across about 500 events — hockey games, conferences and musical performances among them. Thats the opposing point of view. Is it credible?  We turned to Gary Sasse, who headed up the Rhode Island Public Expenditure Council in the 1980s and is now director of the Hassenfeld Institute for Public Leadership at Bryant University. Sasse, who supported the project in 1989, says he believes the presence of the convention center has had some degree of multiplier effect on the local economy -- possibly enough to offset costs. But Sasse emphasizes that the actual numbers are important for this debate and there is no independent entity around to do the hard work of providing a trustworthy assessment.  Who is the independent scorekeeper? he asks. Thats the problem. Our ruling Morgan had her numbers right. And Richard Oster did famously tell the public that the center wasnt going to cost the taxpayers a dime. But she failed to put Osters claim in context. Oster didnt say convention center revenues would pay its bills. He was talking about the centers overall economic impact. And, as Gary Sasse says, without an independent scorekeeper, we wont know whether the centers impact offsets its costs.

Final Rating: Mostly True  ",Says Donald Trump games the U.S. visa system so he can hire temporary foreign workers at low wages.,"Former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg portrayed Donald Trump as a hypocrite on immigration in a speech at the Democratic National Convention. While Trump wants to deport millions of undocumented immigrants, he also uses the system to his advantage to hire foreigners, Bloomberg said in his endorsement of Hillary Clinton July 27, 2016. Trump games the U.S. visa system so he can hire temporary foreign workers at low wages, Bloomberg said. While the accusation that Trump games the system is tough language, the real estate tycoon has hired temporary foreign workers to fill typically low-wage jobs at his properties. We will explain how he did it. H-2B visas We couldnt reach a spokesman for Bloomberg, however, its likely he was referring to Trump hiring foreign workers at his Mar-A-Lago Club, an exclusive eating club in a mansion in Palm Beach County, Florida. Texas Sen. Ted Cruz made a similar attack during the primary. The club has sought H-2B visas for low-skilled, low-wage workers such as cooks, wait staff and housekeepers. H-2B visas are legal — Congress has set the cap at 66,000 per year — and its agricultural counterpart is the H-2A visa. The vast majority of the workers on these two visas programs nationwide are young Mexican men, although news reports say Trump sought workers from Europe. Employers argue they need these temporary workers to fill jobs Americans dont want, while critics say the workers can be exploited. Since the visas are tied to a particular job, the foreigners cant simply jump ship for a better paying job at another resort. The worker is paid based on the prevailing wage or minimum wage. Since 2010, nearly 300 U.S. residents applied or were referred for jobs at Mar-A-Lago, but only 17 were hired, the New York Times reported in February. Meanwhile, Mar-A-Lago sought more than 500 visas for foreign workers. (The visas were also sought at some of his other properties.) We dont know how many people actually used the visas and became employees. To obtain the visas, businesses must prove they were unsuccessful at filling positions with Americans or legal residents. According to the Florida Department of Economic Opportunity, the resort posted jobs through CareerSource Florida, the local workforce development boards throughout the state. A U.S. Labor Department spokesman told PolitiFact Florida previously that 93 people applied for 250 seasonal job openings at the resort. Four were hired, while 79 didnt answer interview requests or turned down jobs (10 applications were classified with unknown status). Documents the resort later filed with the Labor Department showed that many of the American applicants werent hired because they didnt meet requirements. Some applicants didnt want to work split shifts, lacked experience, wanted full-time jobs instead of part time, or didnt respond when the resort contacted them. After that process, the Labor Department certified 685 H-2B visas for the Mar-A-Lago Club between 2008 and 2015. The New York Times asked Trump why he hired so many foreign workers when Americans applied for the same positions. The only reason they wouldnt get a callback is that they werent qualified, for some reason, Trump replied. There are very few qualified people during the high season in the area. But some experts question Trumps assessment that its hard to find local help. In 2015, CareerSource assisted in placing nearly 1,800 candidates in hospitality jobs in Palm Beach County. But Mar-A-Lago didnt show much interest in using the free service. Tom Veenstra, senior director of support services at CareerSource in Palm Beach County, told PolitiFact Florida that the first time his office received a request for helping finding workers was September 2015. (That was shortly after one of the first news reports, by Reuters, about Trumps foreign hiring practices.) Since that time, Mar-A-Lago used the office to hire just one person, a banquet server. We called the HR director after the hire, and she said they were pleased with the hire and the candidates we sent them, Veenstra said. There has been nothing else since then. So is Trump gaming the system? Gabriel Jack Chin, a professor at University of California Davis School of Law, said many of these companies say they cant find American workers but only put in minimal effort. One answer is yes, this is gaming the system, but everybody does it, in the sense that the labor certification standards are widely thought to be evaded in the way that Mar-A-Lago has done in the past, Chin said. Trump spokesman Stephen Miller referred us to Trumps reply during the March 10 debate in Miami when he defended the use of these visas. I'm a businessman, Trump said. These are laws. These are regulations. These are rules. We're allowed to do it. And frankly, because of the devaluations that other countries -- the monetary devaluations that other countries are constantly doing and brilliantly doing against us, it's very, very hard for our companies in this country, in our country, to compete. So I will take advantage of it; they're the laws. But I'm the one that knows how to change it. Nobody else on this dais knows how to change it like I do, believe me. Miller said that Trump has opposed legislation to expand the visa program and pledged to reform visa programs to protect American workers.  Our ruling Bloomberg says Trump games the U.S. visa system so he can hire temporary foreign workers at low wages. Trump sought visas for hundreds of foreign workers to fill temporary positions at his Mar-A-Lago Club in Florida in recent years. Hundreds of U.S. applicants either applied or were referred for the jobs, but only a handful were hired. There is some debate about whether those applicants were qualified or not. Trump has used a legal program to obtain workers with H-2B visas. Saying he games the system is harsh language, and an expert says the process used by Trump is common.",1.0,0.5,1.0,0.7,0.5,0.5,0.3,1.0,0.7,Mostly True

Final Rating: Mostly True  ","Over the past two years, Florida has cut more than $1 billion in taxes.","Despite lawmakers virtually ignoring his budget wish list during the 2016 legislative session, Gov. Rick Scott is boasting about fulfilling a campaign promise to cut taxes by $1 billion in his second term. Scott took credit for the fiscal feat both before and after signing the Legislatures wide-ranging tax-cut package, HB 7099. Over the past two years, Florida has cut more than $1 billion in taxes, an April 13, 2016, press release from the governors office read. Scott had pledged to hit the billion-dollar mark in tax reductions during his successful 2014 re-election campaign, mostly by giving breaks to businesses and limiting property tax growth. In his March 15 press release announcing his intention to sign the Legislatures budget, Scott said hed kept his promise with $1.2 billion in tax cuts over the first two years of his second term. Scott has repeated this claim several times in one form or another. But have taxes really gone down by more than $1 billion in two years, like he says? It depends on how you look at what the Legislature has done, but the changes havent happened the way Scott wanted. Tallying the taxes When we asked Scotts office to break down their budget math for us, they pointed to a chart in their March 15 press release, without further detail:  We were able to verify the figures from Scotts office based on changes passed by the Legislature the last two years. The Florida Office of Economic and Demographic Research compiles an annual list of how much tax revenue will be affected by bills passed during that years legislative session (these can change as the fiscal picture becomes clearer). The House also analyzed HB 7099 to estimate how much the bill would change tax receipts. Cell phone & TV tax cut: In 2015, the Legislature passed a 1.73 percentage point reduction in the states communications services tax, a charge on consumer cell phone, cable and satellite bills. That amounted to a $21 annual reduction on a $100 monthly cell phone and cable bill. Scott had wanted to cut the tax by $120 million, something wed rated a Promise Kept on our Scott-O-Meter.  Property tax reduction: This one is tricky, because its more of a tax shift than a tax cut. Scott also is taking credit for a solution he didnt want. During the 2016 session, the House and Senate agreed to increase per-pupil education spending for K-12 students, something Scott had wanted. Scott initially wanted the bump in education funding paid almost entirely through higher local property tax collections, not with general revenue. (Scott had previously proposed limiting property tax increases with a constitutional amendment, a campaign promise he has so far ignored.) Higher property values meant that collections would increase whether lawmakers raised the key millage rate for local property tax dollars for schools or kept it the same. Instead, the Legislature cut the local rate and paid for the $428 million difference they needed with general tax revenue. Legislators mostly referred to this as tax relief, and not a tax cut. Weve rated a similar statement Mostly True, because the change altered future collections, instead of cutting current collections. Property owners, however, are still shielded from a tax hike. Senate Appropriations Chairman Tom Lee, R-Brandon, told the Tampa Bay Times that if you include this revenue swap, Scott technically had reached $1 billion in tax cuts. But thats dependent on Scott accepting a plan he opposed. The Legislature has to revisit education funding every year, too, so this will no doubt change. Back to school sales tax holiday: Scott counts these breaks from sales tax on school supplies as a cut. These arent permanent cuts, because the Legislature has to approve whether there will be sales tax holidays each year. His figures do jibe with state estimates. The totals are different, in part, because the 2015 holiday was 10 days long, while the 2016 holiday will only be three days long. The terms of exempt items also differs between the two years. Manufacturing machinery and equipment: Getting rid of this tax was another Scott promise, going back to his first term. The sales tax originally was cut back with a limited exemption in 2012, but the following year was suspended by legislators for three years. Starting in 2014, the tax would not apply through April 30, 2017. Scott pushed to make the suspension permanent and in 2016, the Legislature agreed. The Scott-O-Meter rated this a Promise Kept. College textbooks: Scott proposed making college textbooks exempt from sales tax, suggesting it would save the average student about $60 per year. The Legislature agreed to the exemption for the 2015-16 fiscal year, but it was not renewed in the 2016 session. Other tax cuts: Scotts office did not include specific dollar figures for other tax breaks, fee changes and provisions that went down over the last two years. In 2015, the Legislature removed sales taxes on gun club membership fees, put a $60,000 cap on taxes for board repairs, and gave businesses tax credits for pollution cleanup and research, among other measures. For 2016, legislators gave veterans organizations an exemption on food and drink sales taxes, phased out an asphalt tax over three years for government projects, and tinkered with taxes on cruise ship alcohol and tobacco sales, pear cider, and aviation fuel, among other changes. Thats just a sample of the tax changes over the last two years that Scotts office counted. The figures are in the ballpark and add up somewhere north of $1 billion. Whether he can take credit for the total is a tougher question. Experts have told us that counting on things like tax credits and sales tax holidays means consumers have to spend money first before enjoying any benefits. Many of these changes also are temporary or narrowly focused. And remember that local governments may have to raise taxes to account for a change in revenue. Meanwhile, the Legislature has balked at several tax changes Scott has wanted, including eliminating the states corporate income tax — a major Scott request in 2016 that would have cost the state $770 million annually — and phasing out the sales tax on commercial leases. Our ruling Scott said, Over the past two years, Florida has cut more than $1 billion in taxes. The figures are pretty accurate compared to state estimates for tax changes during 2015 and 2016. But theres some question whether you can really consider all of the measures tax cuts. While some of the alterations are permanent, many of them are temporary exemptions or target very specific beneficiaries. Scott also has to ignore some of his earlier proposals and count a plan for education funding that is the opposite of what he wanted to top the $1 billion mark. The statement is accurate but needs some clarification.",0.8,0.3,1.0,0.5,0.0,0.4,0.6,1.0,0.6,Mostly True

Final Rating: True  ",Figures for September 2014s job growth in Wisconsin mark the largest private-sector job creation we've had in the month of September in more than a decade,"When the states monthly jobs report was issued a few weeks before the Nov. 4, 2014 election, it received more attention than usual from Gov. Scott Walker. With jobs and the economy a key focus in the tight race between Walker and Democratic challenger Mary Burke, the governor touted a report that said the state had added an estimated 8,400 jobs in September. A day after the numbers came out, and hours before his second debate with Burke, Waker told the League of Wisconsin Municipalities in an Oct. 17, 2014 speech: Yesterday at noon, the Wisconsin Department of Workforce Development announced that our labor numbers, the numbers of jobs created in the private sector last month, for September, was 8,400 -- 8,400 new private-sector jobs were created in the state of Wisconsin last month. He continued with a claim we want to check: That's the largest private-sector job creation we've had in the month of September in more than a decade. In more than a decade. In the days since, Walker has repeated the claim many times. Is he right? Tallying jobs The September jobs report is a preliminary one. It is extrapolated from a monthly survey of 3.5 percent of state employers by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. As such, the monthly numbers have a large margin of error and can swing widely when they are made final. This batch, for instance, has a margin of error of 7,980. The numbers can even change again later, when much more accurate quarterly numbers -- based on a census of nearly every state employer -- can be used to adjust monthly numbers. Nevertheless, the numbers are the most recent ones available. When we asked Walkers campaign for backup, spokeswoman Alleigh Marre simply made the point they are the most recent month numbers and noted the numbers are widely reported each month. When we looked at a decade of Bureau of Labor Statistics data, September 2014 did come out on top: 2005: 2,000 2006: 1,200 2007: -3,700 2008: -8,700 2009: 400 2010: -3,200 2011: 4,400 2012: 6,400 2013: 1,300 2014: 8,400 The next-largest job gain for that time frame was an addition of 6,400 jobs in September 2012. The pendulum swung the other way in 2008, during the worst stretch of the economic downturn, when there were 8,700 jobs lost in that single month. To be sure, the September 2014 numbers are preliminary and the ones for previous years are final. So, there is a bit of apples-oranges going on in the comparison. In that claim, Walker had compared preliminary July numbers from 2014 with final July numbers from 2013. That comparison showed the state ranked third in the Midwest. Of course, we cant predict what the revised September jobs figure will be when the next round of data comes out in November 2014. But if its revised down by 2,000 or more jobs, then this would not be the best September in 10 years. Again, that best-in-Midwest growth claim is instructive. When the final numbers came out, the ranking fell from third to fourth. (And Walker revised his talking point.) In any case, we can only rate a claim based on what is known at the time it is made. And this one holds up, even by another measure. We also dug out the preliminary September reports for past years, so we could see how preliminary numbers for September 2014 compare to preliminary numbers for previous Septembers (Were kinda geeky that way). The records for 2013 were complicated because of the federal government shut down and the comparable data for before 2009 wasnt available. But the preliminary tally of 8,400 jobs in 2014 topped 2012 ( increase of 1,500), 2011 (decrease of 900) and 2010 (decrease of 9,900). Past use of the numbers Close readers will note that Walker has had a decidedly love-hate-love relationship with the monthly numbers, at times embracing them and at times dismissing them. In December 2011, Workforce Development Secretary Reggie Newson described the numbers this way: These unreliable employment statistics out of Washington misinform the public and create unnecessary anxiety for job seekers and job creators about the shape of our states economy. Instead, state officials -- including Walker -- began to stress the more accurate quarterly numbers. Until the campaign season, when monthly numbers were back in vogue. We have even put Walkers views on the numbers on the Flip-O-Meter, and rated them a Full Flop. But here we are simply rating what Walker said; the Truth-O-Meter does not have a hypocrisy setting. Our rating Walker claims that the September report which showed an increase of 8,400 jobs was the best in the past 10 years for that month. That stacks up. And a BLS official says the approach is legitimate, with the caveat the latest year is preliminary.",1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,True

Final Rating: Mostly True  ",We see a quarter-billion dollars in a pension fund that needs to be funded at $1.2 billion.,"Providence Mayor Angel Taveras had to deal with near bankruptcy in the capital city after he took office in 2011. As the city struggled to fix its budget problems, he won union concessions to reduce pension costs. But critics question how far the pension deal negotiated by Taveras, now a candidate for governor, went to fix the problem. The most recent figures released last month show the plan is only 31.4-percent funded. Republican mayoral candidate Daniel Harrop raised the issue during the Dec. 15, 2013, edition of WPRI's Newsmakers program. Asked why he wants to run again, he said the city needs a mayor who will stay around to solve the city's long-term problems and not have aspirations for higher office, like Taveras and his predecessor, David Cicilline, now a member of Congress. We see a quarter billion dollars in a pension fund that needs to be funded at $1.2 billion, Harrop said. That would mean that the city, at the time, had a pension system that was only 20 percent funded. (The U.S. Government Accountability Office says public pension plans should be at least 80 percent funded.) First, we need to explain why we're ruling on a seemingly-straightforward statement two months after it was made. We began work on this item in December but getting up-to-date numbers about the city's pension fund turned out to be maddeningly difficult. The city was often slow to respond and listed different amounts in different reports over different time frames. We decided to wait for the completion of the latest estimate of the city's accrued liability, in part because the city has refused to release an earlier actuary report for the year ending June 30, 2012, citing a dispute over its accuracy. Finally, a week ago, the city released the latest actuarial report, for the year ending June 30, 2013, allowing us to proceed. So lets go back to December, when Harrop made his statement. At that point, we asked Harrop about his figures. He cited two blog postings on the Providence pension system from reporter Ted Nesi of WPRI.com. One, published Oct. 30, reported that the fund had $283 million in assets on Oct. 22. The other, published Dec. 7, said the fund had a liability of almost $1.2 billion. Harrop also cited a 2011 city report saying the liability as of June 30, 2010, was $1.256 billion, with assets of $316 million. We don't know the precise status of the pension system the day Harrop made his statement. But now that we have the up-to-date financial reports, we do have a snapshot of what the system's assets and liabilities were as of June 30, 2013. According to that latest actuary report, released Jan. 31, 2014, on June 30 the city needed $1.2 billion to cover its current and future pension obligations. On that point, Harrop turns out to have been right on the money. At the same time, according to both the actuary report and the city's latest annual financial report, released about a month after Harrop made his statement, the Providence pension fund had $336 million in investments and other assets, a lot more than what Harrop stated. The amount in the city's investment account was $247 million. In addition, there was $3 million in cash and $59 million the city paid into the fund that year. Finally, the report counted as an asset $26 million owed to the fund from loans made to people in the retirement system at a rate of 9.25 percent, according to David Ortiz, spokesman for Mayor Taveras. Add all those together and you get the $336 million. In Harrops defense, at the time he made his statement, up-to-date data on the citys pension obligations were not available. The city was withholding it as part of an ongoing dispute with its actuary, Buck Consultants, who the city accused of making fundamental and inexcusable errors in its 2012 pension calculations. This year Providence used a different firm, Segal Consulting. Our ruling In December, Daniel Harrop said, We see a quarter billion dollars in a pension fund that needs to be funded at $1.2 billion. Harrop was citing numbers from different sources and different years, and those numbers are moving targets. They all support his underlying point: Providence's pension program is woefully underfunded, even with recent concessions negotiated with the city's unions. Based on the latest report of the city's actuary, which was not available at the time Harrop made his statement, the candidate was correct on his $1.2 billion figure. At the same time, there was significantly more than a quarter billion dollars set aside in the city's coffers for pension costs. But the number he cited accurately reflected the approximate amount the city had in its investment portfolio.

","Says U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin wants to use a government jet that costs $25,000 per hour for his honeymoon.","U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan frequently criticizes the administration of Republican President Donald Trump. On Sept. 13, 2017, the Madison-area Democrat got a little more personal, tweeting this about Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin: Mnuchin wants to use a gov't jet that costs $25k/hour for his honeymoon. And he's in charge of tax reform for the middle class? #OutOfTouch Whats this all about? Revelations in the news Mnuchin is a former longtime banker, Goldman Sachs executive and a Hollywood producer (The Lego Batman Movie and others). When tapped for Trumps Cabinet in late 2016, he was worth $300 million, according to Forbes. As treasury secretary, Mnuchin advises Trump on economic and financial issues. In June 2017, with Vice President Mike Pence officiating, he married Scottish actress Louise Linton. Their honeymoon was in August 2017, according to news reports. Pocans tweet was sent the same day ABC News broke a story that was picked up by the Washington Post, USA Today and many other national media. The story said: Mnuchin requested, in writing, a U.S. Air Force jet to take him and his actress-model wife Louise Linton on their honeymoon to Scotland, France and Italy. The jet could cost $25,000 per hour to operate, according to an Air Force spokesman. A Treasury Department spokesman said Mnuchin made the request out of concern for maintaining a secure method of communication, but the secretary's office decided (before ABCs story) that the use of military aircraft was unnecessary after it became apparent that other methods for secure communication were available. So, based on the news report, Mnuchins request isnt current, as Pocans tweet suggests, and the cost isnt necessarily $25,000 per hour. But the thrust of the claim is correct: Mnuchin requested a military jet for his honeymoon. Mnuchins response When we asked the Treasury Department about Pocans claim, we were referred to a video clip of an interview Mnuchin did with Politico the day after the ABC News story aired. Asked about the matter, he said: I probably spend over 50 percent of my time on national security issues .This had nothing to do with convenience, this was purely about national security. The government has never paid for any of my personal travel. My staff wanted to make sure that I constantly had access to secure communication and the use of a jet for his honeymoon was one of the things we explored. So, they put in a request to consider the use of an aircraft ... and ultimately we withdrew the request. We found a way of dealing with other secure communication. Asked whether the jet was a staff request, not his personal request, Mnuchin said: Again, I discussed with the staff a bunch of alternatives  one of the things they suggested, I agreed that they would look into it, OK? We looked into other things, as well. When we found alternative uses, we withdrew the request. So, Mnuchin doesnt deny requesting the jet, though he suggests it was out of concern for national security. A final note: As of Sept. 14, 2017, the day after the ABC story, the Treasury Departments inspector generals office was looking at all requests for, and use of, government aircraft by Mnuchin, that office told reporters. The inquiry was launched after Mnuchin and his wife took a trip to Kentucky just ahead of the August 2017 solar eclipse. Mnuchin held an event with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky.,and visited Fort Knox, where he and Linton viewed the eclipse near the path of totality, the Los Angeles Times reported. Treasury officials defended that visit as official government travel and said Mnuchin would reimburse the government for bringing his wife along. Our rating Pocan says Mnuchin wants to use a government jet that costs $25,000 per hour for his honeymoon. Pocans use of wants wrongly suggests it is a pending request, and the news report he cites said the jet could cost $25,000 an hour. But essentially Pocan is on target: Mnuchin put in a request for a government plane to take him and his wife to their honeymoon destinations, though he did not use one.",0.5,0.5,1,0.5,0,0,0.5,0.5,0.5,Half True

Final Rating: Mostly True  ",Says Bill OReilly spoke 40 percent of the words in an interview with President Barack Obama.,"At least among Fox News viewers, nothing boosts audience like taking President Barack Obama to task. The day after Fox News host Bill OReilly had an interview with Obama, OReilly picked up an additional 1 million viewers for his show The OReilly Factor. The president sat down with OReilly right before the Super Bowl, and the tone of the conversation itself stirred up a flurry of reactions. Heres a small example from a moment when OReilly pressed Obama on the administrations response to the attack on the American compound in Benghazi, Libya. OReilly: If (Ambassador to the United Nations) Susan Rice goes out and tells the world that it was a spontaneous demonstration... Obama: Bill... OReilly: -- off a videotape but your... Obama: Bill... OReilly: -- your commanders and the secretary of Defense know it's a terror attack... Obama: Now, Bill... OReilly: Just... Obama: -- Bill... OReilly: -- as an American... Obama: -- Bill -- Bill... OReilly: -- I'm just confused. Obama: And I'm -- and I'm trying to explain it to (you), if you want to listen. No wonder that many observers described the interview as testy. Washington Post columnist Dana Milbank called it the roughest and nastiest exchange of the three times that OReilly has interviewed Obama. He interrupted the president 42 times in 10 minutes, Milbank said on MSNBCs Politics Nation. Of all the words uttered in this 10-minute interview, 40 percent were uttered by OReilly. We wanted to check Milbanks numbers. Not on the interruptions, but on the word count. We pulled out our digital centrifuge and separated the OReilly and Obama utterances. According to our research, OReilly delivered 787 words to Obamas 1,484. This gave OReilly 35 percent of the conversation. Thats a little lower than Milbank said but more or less in the same ballpark. We reached out to Milbank and did not hear back. To satisfy our own curiosity, we decided to compare this with another one-on-one interview between the president and a journalist. A couple of days before Obama sat down with OReilly, he did the same with CNNs Jake Tapper. We subjected that transcript to the same rigorous methods and found that Tapper spoke 23 percent of the time, leaving the president the other 77 percent. The precise word counts were Tapper -- 849 and Obama -- 2,886. Milbanks point was that OReillys interview was almost as much about OReilly as it was about the president. We dont know about that, but we can say that OReilly spoke about 50 percent morethan Tapper did in his interview. The topics in the two interviews differed greatly. OReilly brought up Obamacare, the Benghazi attack and the IRS scrutiny of conservative groups seeking tax-exempt status. Tapper focused on issues like immigration reform, legalization of marijuana, spying by the National Security Agency, and security at the Winter Olympics in Sochi. OReilly had a second installment of his time with Obama that aired the night after the Super Bowl. Milbanks comment came on the same night, so were counting only the segment that had aired publicly at that point. For the record, in the second installment, OReilly asked the president about African-American children raised in single-parent households, school vouchers, the Keystone pipeline, a contraceptive coverage exemption for Little Sisters of the Poor, and veterans benefits. Our ruling Milbank said OReilly said 40 percent of the words during his interview with the president. That was a little high. By our count, 35 percent would be more accurate. OReilly spoke decidedly more than Tapper did in his time with Obama.",0.7,0.2,1.0,0.7,0.0,0.1,0.3,1.0,0.8,Mostly True

Final Rating: Mostly True  ","The R.I. Turnpike and Bridge Authority was supposed to exist only until the bonds used to build the Newport Bridge were paid off through tolls. Once the bonds were paid, the Newport Bridge was to be transferred to the State of Rhode Island and become toll-free.","One of the most contentious issues of 2013, at least among residents of the eastern half of Rhode Island, is the question of whether there should be a toll on the new Sakonnet River Bridge. In an Aug. 14, 2013, commentary in The Providence Journal, Steven Frias, a lawyer and the state's Republican National Committeeman, argued that Rhode Island should use the revenue from its gasoline tax and motor vehicle fees exclusively to maintain its bridges and roads. We were intrigued by this statement: When the Rhode Island Turnpike and Bridge Authority was first created in 1954, it was supposed to exist only until the bonds used to build the Newport Bridge were paid off through tolls. Once the bonds were paid, the Newport Bridge was to be transferred to the State of Rhode Island and become toll-free. The state has always charged a toll on that span, now officially known as the Pell Bridge. We were curious about the accuracy of Frias' characterization. When we contacted Frias, he sent us 34 pages from Chapter 3390, the 1954 act creating the authority. It authorized the construction of the Newport Bridge, the acquisition of the Jamestown Bridge, and the construction of a turnpike for the bridge that could run from Connecticut, through Washington County to the Massachusetts border. It also gave the authority the right to finance, maintain, repair and operate any of those projects, along with the ability to issue new bonds and collect tolls of any amount at any and all points along the project. The law is silent about ending tolls on the Newport Bridge, which opened June 28, 1969, although Section 17 dictates that No tolls shall be charged for traffic over the Jamestown Bridge after December 31, 1970. On that date, the Jamestown Bridge, which has since been replaced, was to become property of the state, without any money being owed on it. Frias, asked about his statement, focused on that section, which also says that once the authority has paid off all its bonds or set aside enough money to cover those bonds, all other projects financed under the provisions of this act shall be transferred to the state in good condition and repair, and thereupon the authority shall be dissolved . . .  So the law did call for eventually turning everything, including the Newport Bridge, over to the state. But, once again, there is no mention of ending any other tolls. In fact, the law doesn't specifically dictate that the Newport Bridge have a toll. The authority has continued to exist to maintain the bridge, now 44 years old. RITBA chairman David Darlington said the authority currently has about $50 million in bonds that remain to be paid off, and that indebtedness is expected to continue because the state doesn't have the funds to take over and maintain the bridge. (The current bonds mature in 2017.) Frias said his statement is correct because the original legislation makes it clear that the intent was to eventually transfer ownership of the Newport Bridge to the state. The bridge would then have to be toll free, he argued, because the state, at the time, had not given itself the authority to levy tolls on roadways. This is inherent in the law, he said. An intent to transfer ownership of a bridge to an entity that has no legal authority to impose tolls, at the time the legislation was first enacted, is an intent to make that bridge a toll-free (bridge). That strikes us as a stretch, especially when the law specifically talks about transferring the Jamestown Bridge to the state and making it toll free. If the act of transference automatically meant that no tolls could be charged, as Frias asserts, there would be no need to mention ending the Jamestown bridge toll.  We also checked with Thomas Evans, the state librarian, who pointed out that the act creating the Mount Hope Bridge Authority, also passed in 1954, also contains language that calls for the project to be turn over to the state AND be toll free after Dec. 31, 1969. (East Bay residents will note that the bridge subsequently carried a toll until 1998.) Frias was not dissuaded. He said it was necessary to specify a date for the Jamestown and Mount Hope bridges to become toll-free because, unlike the Newport Bridge, they were in existence in 1954. It makes no sense that the Newport Bridge would have a toll on it once it was transferred over to the state, he said. The state had not given itself legal authority to impose a toll in 1954 (nor has it since then) therefore a bridge owned by the State is synonymous with a bridge that cannot have a toll. Legal interpretations aside, it seems that the public perception at that time was that the Newport Bridge toll would go away eventually. Frias produced a copy of an article in the March 11, 1963, edition of The Evening Bulletin, headlined Newporters Pressing for Span. Part of it reports on arguments of the bridge advocates, saying, And when the new bridge finally was paid for, they add, the state would come into ownership of a valuable property, a toll-free bridge across the East Passage. Darlington said that when he was appointed to the RITBA board in 2002, My dad said, 'Those tolls were supposed to come off that bridge when it was paid for. It has to be well paid for by now. Go down and get those tolls taken off that bridge.' Then, when you find out what it costs to maintain the bridges, the state doesn't have anything like the money that's required, Darlington said. It's so enormous, and you have to focus on them year after year because if you let a bridge go three, four, or five years, you have to start planning a new bridge. So it's really not practical. Our ruling Steven Frias said that When the Rhode Island Turnpike and Bridge Authority was first created in 1954, it was supposed to exist only until the bonds used to build the Newport Bridge were paid off through tolls. Once the bonds were paid, the Newport Bridge was to be transferred to the State of Rhode Island and become toll-free. The first sentence accurately characterizes the 1954 legislation. The big question is whether the bridge was supposed to eventually be toll-free. Despite what the public believed and Frias is inferring, there was no mandate in the 1954 legislation to end tolls on the Newport Bridge once the state took ownership. Perhaps other historians have additional evidence that will cause us to rethink our ruling. But for now, while most of Frias' statement is true, the key element regarding tolls on the Newport Bridge is open to serious question. For that reason, we rule it Mostly True.

Final Rating: Half True  ",Says that to drive the length of the newly drawn 15th District youd find yourself on the road as long as it would take to drive from Columbus to Niagara Falls.,"Democratic Party chief Chris Redfern gets paid to take shots at Republicans.On Sept.15, Redfern had a juicy new target for his barbs -- a new congressional map that Republicans had rolled out the day before. It showed several sprawling districts winding through multiple counties to create solid GOP majorities. Prepared by Republicans staffers, the congressional map redrew Ohios 18 congressional districts into 16 districts — 12 Republican and four Democratic districts. It was attacked by Redfern (and other Democrats) who said the serpentine districts were mapped out purely for GOP partisan advantage.As he mocked the lines drawn by Republicans, Redfern highlighted the district that many independent observers found to be the clearest example of gerrymandering — the 15th Congressional District, which winds through portions of 13 counties and has a circumference of 934 miles.Now represented by Republican Steve Stivers, the district is shaped like the open jaws of a crocodile or a reverse Pac-man, in Redferns words.To drive from northern Union County to Athens to Hillsboro without leaving Steves district youd find yourself on the road as long as it would take to drive from Columbus to Niagara Falls, Redfern told reporters at his news conference.Sure, the district is a sprawling one — but a greater drive time than to the Canadian border? PolitiFact Ohio gassed up the Ford Factfinder and see where the facts met the road.Democratic Party spokesman Seth Bringman shared the Google mapping he did to back up Redferns assertion.He forwarded a route which began in Essex in northern Union County winding through Madison, Franklin, Fairfield, and Perry Counties as it headed east. Heading due south into Athens County, the route then swung westward traveling though Vinton and Ross counties to end in Hillsboro, the county seat of Highland County.Google maps spit out a total distance of 259 miles and said it would take nearly 6 hours — 5 hours and 58 minutes to traverse it. Meanwhile, Columbus to Niagara Falls, N.Y., is 349 miles -- mostly via freeway -- and a traveling time of six hours and one minute, according to Google Maps.PolitiFact Ohio scrutinized the Democratic route and it does follow the contours of Stivers new district. However, the Democrats did fudge one tiny part of their route — they took state routes through southern Franklin County that are near, but not actually in Stivers district.But they had to. Or youd have to swim.Its so skinny at the southern edge of Franklin County that no road passes through it, The Columbus Dispatch reported Sept. 18, 2011. He would have to swim across the Scioto River near the Southerly Wastewater Treatment Plant to travel from one end of his district to the other.Bringman acknowledged that the map was more of an interpretation of driving through the proposed district than actually doing it.To navigate the Southern end of Franklin County in the proposed 15th District, one would need to drive off-road for about 5 km between Lynnbrook and Lockbourne and ford the Scioto River Oregon Trail-style, he wrote in an e-mail. Depending on the vehicle being used, this could add some time to the trip. After passing Lockbourne, the driver may need to borrow a runway at Rickenbacker International Airport, assuming FAA approval.Additionally, it bears pointing out that the Democratic route is an attempt to get around Stivers district by staying wholly in the district at all times — its not how someone would actually travel to get from one point to another.For example, Stivers district includes only portions of U.S. 33, so you cant use it to travel from Columbus to Athens even though its a direct link between the two cities.He will be taking direct routes not only traveling within the lines of his district, said Courtney Whetstone, a staffer with Stivers Columbus congressional office. There isnt any part of his district farther than an hour and a half from his house.Redferns statement does include the phrase without leaving Stivers district but the twists and turns of the road embodied in that statement are not made clear.So after all this ramblin through Ohio, where do we end up?Google maps estimates Redferns route plotted through the reverse Pac-man district would take six hours to drive and that matches the estimated drive time from Columbus to Niagara Falls.The claim has to take a detour, though, because its not possible to drive through the new Ohio 15th in southern Franklin County. But then again, we can award points for context because the claim supports Redferns larger point -- that the boundaries for this sprawling district were drawn to achieve a political purpose.Lastly, it needs to be said that Redferns route is not the way that Stivers or anyone would travel from one part of the district to another. Rather, they would choose a direct route that crosses district boundaries and would be a much shorter drive. Thats a point that provides clarification.",0.5,0.5,1.0,0.5,0.0,0.5,0.5,1.0,0.5,Half True

Final Rating: Mostly True  ","If you look at the three people on the (debate) stage from the United States Senate, all three of them have a combined two bills that became law that they've sponsored.","Three senators running for the Republican presidential nomination have slim records in Congress, said former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush. On NBCs Meet the Press Nov. 1, Bush said that he, on the other hand, got to be governor of a state and accomplish big things. This is about public service, about solving problems. If you look at the three people on the stage from the United States Senate, all three of them have a combined two bills that became law that they've sponsored. If you look at Hillary Clinton, in 10 years, three bills she sponsored that became law. This is the gridlock that I'm running to try to break up. We wondered if Bush was right that the three sitting senators he debated against Oct. 28-- Rand Paul, R-Ky., Marco Rubio, R-Fla. and Ted Cruz, R-Texas -- have only had a combined two bills become law so far.(Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., is also a sitting senator running for the Republican nomination, but Bush did not include Graham in his count, as he appeared in an earlier debate for candidates with the lowest poll numbers.) (In March, we looked into Cruzs track record, and we looked at Clintons in June.) We evaluated Cruz, Rubio and Pauls legislative records using Congressional Quarterlys BillTrack database and GovTracks advanced legislation search. We found that Bushs statement is accurate in that the three senators have sponsored just two bills that eventually became law. But the claim leaves out some important context, such as outside factors working against the senators and the fact that this is an incomplete measure of a senators impact in Congress. Put another way, its unclear how much you should read into what Bush said. Serving since 2013, Cruz has been the primary sponsor on 57 bills, one of which has become law. Rubio and Paul both joined the Senate in 2011. Rubio has sponsored 106 bills, and President Barack Obama signed one of them into law. Paul has sponsored 141 bills but none has yet to become law. Cruzs bill, enacted in 2014, denied admission to the United States any United Nations representative who poses a national security threat (a response to Irans chosen U.N. representative). The bill was uncontroversial and passed unanimously in both the Senate and the House. Obama signed Rubios bill in 2015. This law, which authorized the State Department to support womens rights in developing countries, was also uncontroversial and passed both chambers unanimously. All three also have their names on laws as cosponsors: Cruz has three, Rubio has 18and Paul has four. The caveats to Bushs claim So its true that Cruz, Rubio and Paul havent had many of their ideas signed into law. But there are several caveats to Bushs claims. Seniority matters. Cruz has only been in Congress for 2.5 years; Paul and Rubio have been there for 4.5. In 2014, National Journal analyzed which senators have sponsored or cosponsored the most bills that eventually became law and found that the longer a senator had been in office, the more bills they passed. Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, has passed more than 740 bills and has been in the Senate since 1977. At the time of National Journals report, the median was 78 bills passed and belonged to Sen. David Vitter, R-La., who has been a senator since 2005. Whos in control matters. Until this year, Republicans were the minority party in the Senate, putting Cruz, Rubio and Paul at a disadvantage. Its expected that the majority leader will schedule bills for his own party more frequently than for the minority, said Joshua Huder, senior fellow at Georgetown Universitys Government Affairs Institute. Even within their own party, more junior members priorities are at the back of the line. First-term senators have a lot of headwinds, particularly when in the minority, Huder told PolitiFact when we wrote about Cruzs record back in March. That said, the Senates design allows for individual members to make a difference, even if theyre not in the majority, said Sarah Binder, senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and an expert in legislative politics. They make a difference in ways other than just passing laws. They can sponsor amendments to bills, for example, or their bills can get absorbed into broad omnibus legislation. Cruz successfully sponsored an amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act that will give Purple Hearts to those killed or wounded in the shooting at Fort Hood in Texas in 2009. They can also use their platform to shape the national conversation, such as Pauls efforts to raise awareness of privacy issues and National Security Agency surveillance of citizens' phone and other records. Or, they can put a plug in the opposing partys agenda, like when Cruz spearheaded efforts to block presidential appointments to push his priorities. That's not quite the same as shepherding a bill into law, but it's an example of the ways in which merely counting bills enacted gives short shrift to other ways in which senators can make a difference, Binder said. Effectiveness outside of sponsorship. Another problem with simply counting the number of bills passed is that it doesnt account for individual bills political salience. Binder noted that Rubio played a major role in crafting the 2013 Gang of Eight immigration reform bill, and even though that bill did not become law, it was an important piece of legislation that continues to be relevant. And the Senate is only one-third of the lawmaking process (the other parts being the House and the president), so many factors that go into passing a law is out of the sponsors hands, Huder said. A Cruz spokesperson told us that his impact in Congress is demonstrated through more actions than just the number of laws passed.We also reached out to the campaigns forRubio and Paul, and we'll update this post if we hear back. Looking at Clinton, Sanders Because Bush mentioned her, we wanted to briefly touch on Clintons record, too. Serving as the Democratic senator from New York for eight years (not 10, as Bush said), 2001 through January 2009, Clinton sponsored 416 bills, and three became law. She also co-sponsored 74 bills that were eventually enacted into law. Theres one more senator running for president: Bernie Sanders, I-Vt. Of the 190 bills Sanders has sponsored since joining the Senate in 2007, two have become law. He has cosponsored 33 that were enacted. Our ruling Bush said that the three Republican senators running for president have a combined two bills that became law that they've sponsored. Bush has his numbers right: Of all the bills Cruz, Rubio and Paul have sponsored combined, only two bills have been signed into law. But experts told us that this isnt a great measurement of a legislators effectiveness, and there are other ways to show impact in Congress. All three senators have their fingerprints on numerous laws as cosponsors or amendment authors. Editor's note: This post has been updated to include a response from the Cruz campaign that we received after publishing the article and to clarify the senators identified by Bush in his claim.

Final Rating: Mostly True",There's not a major bill I know with Hillary's name on it.,"Before he bowed out of the race, Sen. Joe Biden dismissed the legislative accomplishments of three Democratic primary rivals with whom he served. Biden was particularly direct summing up Clinton's tenure, saying, There's not a major bill I know with Hillary's name on it. In some ways, Biden's assessment is correct: Clinton has not been the lead sponsor of legislation dealing with a major national issue that made its way to President Bush's desk. But New York's junior senator has had comparatively few opportunities after spending four of her seven years in the chamber as a member of the minority. Instead, she has worked the way many senators do, introducing bills that wind up getting included in another's initiative, drafting a Senate companion bill to a popular House initiative or working with home state Republicans to send money to New York or protect local interests. After eight years as first lady, Clinton deliberately sought a lower profile in the Senate, respecting the seniority system and tending to steer away from contentious national debates such as health care. She also has adopted moderate — some would say carefully calibrated — rhetoric on abortion, the war in Iraq, fiscal policy and social issues. The approach surprised many of her critics, who suspected she would stake out more liberal positions and primarily use New York and the Senate as a stepping stone for her national ambitions. She was the leading Democratic sponsor of a 2003 law that gave the Food and Drug Administration the power to order drug companies to test their drugs to determine the proper dosages for children. The effort was inspired by cases in which children died or were injured taking drugs or using medical devices shown safe for adults. She worked with South Carolina Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham in 2006 to get portions of legislation she authored to extend health coverage to National Guard troops and reservists included in a fiscal 2007 defense authorization bill. After the Sept. 11 attacks, Clinton authored a companion bill to House legislation ensuring that public safety officers killed or injured in the line of duty during the attacks would receive expedited payment of benefits. On another matter closely related to her home state, Clinton worked with Republican congressman Tom Reynolds to keep the Niagara Falls Air Reserve Station open at a time when the Pentagon was closing bases — a move that saved 800 jobs. Clinton has effectively used her senatorial power to influence a handful of issues and to focus on local politics. Biden is correct when he says her name is not on a major bill, but as Biden knows better than most, that's not a fair measure of a legislator's accomplishments. We rule his statement Mostly True.

Final Rating: Mostly True  ",A clear majority of Americans support removing the cost-sharing requirement for prescription contraceptive coverage.,"U.S. Rep. Rush Holt says the federal mandate requiring most health care plans to offer free contraceptive coverage makes sense.And he claims a majority of Americans agree with him.Fierce debate on the issue erupted when guidelines issued by the U.S. Health and Human Services Department that required insurance plans to cover birth control as preventive services, without co-pays or deductibles, were made final without exemptions for some employers with religious affiliations. On Feb. 10, President Barack Obama announced a compromise: if a religious-affiliated employer objected to providing contraceptive coverage, the responsibility would fall on the insurance company.In a Feb. 24 e-mail newsletter explaining his support for Obamas decision, Holt (D- 12th Dist.) said: Nearly all American women, including women of faith, have used contraception sometimes, and a clear majority of Americans support removing the cost-sharing requirement for prescription contraceptive coverage.Our colleagues at PolitiFact national recently ruled on a claim that addressed the first half of Holts statement. A White House official said: Most women, including 98 percent of Catholic women, have used contraception. That claim earned a Mostly True.With the birth control plan still under fierce scrutiny, we questioned Holts other claim. Despite all the rancor, do Americans favor the plan?Holts spokesman, Thomas Seay, pointed to a February health tracking poll from the Kaiser Family Foundation that found that 63 percent of respondents support the new federal requirement that private health insurance plans cover the cost of birth control and 33 percent oppose it. The margin of error was 3 percentage points.But thats just one poll of 1,519 adults. We found seven other surveys that asked respondents about their views on requiring health care plans to cover birth control. Five support Holts claim.A CBS News/New York Times poll found an even larger majority of Americans -- 66 percent -- support the plan requiring private health insurance plans to cover the full cost of birth control. About a quarter of respondents opposed the plan, with a margin of error of 3 percentage points. When asked specifically about the same requirement for employers with religious affiliations, support decreased slightly, with 61 percent in favor and 31 percent opposed.A recent Fox News poll found 61 percent of respondents supported requiring employer health plans to cover birth control for women and 34 percent opposed. The poll had a margin of error of 3 percentage points.A survey by the Democratic firm Public Policy Polling conducted on behalf of Planned Parenthood and a poll by the Public Religion Research Institute both found majorities in support of employers providing health care plans that would cover the cost of birth control.Another poll conducted for NBC News and the Wall Street Journal found 53 percent of respondents favored the requirement and 33 percent opposed it, with a margin of error of 3.5 percentage points. Thats a majority, but one that could possibly be affected by the margin of error.Two of the polls we reviewed found opposition to providing free birth control coverage.A Quinnipiac University poll with a margin of error of 1.9 percentage points found a split of 47 percent in support of requiring private employers to offer free birth control coverage and 48 percent opposed.A poll conducted by Rasmussen Reports -- widely considered Republican-leaning -- found 46 percent opposed the plan and 43 percent supported it. The survey had a margin of error of 3 percentage points.Our rulingHolt said a clear majority of Americans support removing the cost-sharing requirement for prescription contraceptive coverage.We found eight polls that recently asked respondents whether they supported or opposed requiring health care plans to cover the cost of birth control.In six of those surveys there was majority support, only one of which could be impacted by a margin of error. Two others polls showed more opposition than support. Still, Holts claim is backed by most of the polls we reviewed.Overall, this claim is Mostly True.

Final Rating: Mostly True  ","If you look at last year's presidential campaign, you can't find a mention of public option.","Democrats hoping to pass health care legislation through the Senate need 60 votes to begin consideration of the bill and, ultimately, to pass it. That means every Democrat and the two independents who generally vote with them need to approve.One of those independents is Sen. Joe Lieberman of Connecticut. Lieberman favors health care reform but opposes the public option. Hetold Politicothat he was keeping all my options open when it comes to votes on health care.He said the public option has only recently become a key part of Democratic plans for a health care overhaul.It's classic politics of our time that if you look at the campaign last year, presidential, you can't find a mention of public option, Lieberman said. It was added after the election as a part of what we normally consider health insurance reform — insurance market reforms, cover people, cover people who are not covered.Politico pointed out, correctly, that Lieberman was wrong about the public option being added after the election. It was part of Obama's plans released publicly during the campaign.But we wanted to check his statement that during the 2008 presidential election, you can't find a mention of public option.Here at PolitiFact, we covered the Democratic primaries and examined the candidates' plans for health care reform in great detail. The most contentious issue during the primary was support for what is known as the individual mandate -- the requirement that everyone have health insurance or face a tax penalty. We don't recall any significant discussion of a public option, nor did we do any Truth-O-Meter items on it during the campaign.To make sure we weren't missing anything, we conducted a database search of campaign coverage by all news outlets. We found very few news reports during the campaign that mentioned the public option or a public plan as part of Obama's health proposals, with the notable exception of aNew York Timesstory published on May 30, 2007, headlined, Obamacalls for wider and less costlyhealthcare coverage.Here's what theTimesreported:Mr. Obama would create a public plan for individuals who cannot obtain group coverage through their employers or the existing government programs, like Medicaid or the State Childrens Health Insurance Program. Children would be required to have health insurance. Subsidies would be available for those who need help with the cost of coverage.He would also create a National Health Insurance Exchange, a regulated marketplace of competing private health plans intended to give individuals other, more affordable options for coverage. The public plan would compete in that Insurance Exchange, advisers said.The Obama campaign mentioned the public option briefly in its health position paper and on its Web site. A typical description went like this:The Obama-Biden plan will create a National Health Insurance Exchange to help individuals purchase new affordable health care options if they are uninsured or want new health insurance. Through the Exchange, any American will have the opportunity to enroll in the new public plan or an approved private plan, and income-based sliding scale tax credits will be provided for people and families who need it. ... The Exchange will require that all the plans offered are at least as generous as the new public plan and meet the same standards for quality and efficiency.But there was little discussion about the public option. The debate in both the primary and the general election focused on the mandate, costs and covering the uninsured. We found the public option mentioned in only 70 articles or transcripts during the entire campaign and months prior to the inauguration.It wasn't until after Obama took office that there was sustained attention to the issue. There were 50 items published between January and May and then coverage exploded this past summer. Major newspapers produced about 650 significant stories or op-eds on Obama and the public option in June, July and August.Lieberman was wrong that the public option was added after the election, but he makes a valid point that it wasn't emphasized or discussed much during the campaign. Lieberman said, It's classic politics of our time that if you look at the campaign last year, presidential, you can't find a mention of public option. We found a few mentions, but the public option was not at all a significant point of debate during the presidential campaign.",0.6,0.5,1.0,0.5,0.0,0.4,0.5,0.8,0.7,Mostly True

Final Rating: Mostly True  ",California has seen a 56 percent decline in the gun murder rate since the 1990s.,"California voters added to what are considered the nations strongest gun control laws on Election Day by approving Proposition 63. The measure imposes background checks on ammunition sales; bans possession of large-capacity ammunition magazines; and forces owners to give up their weapons as soon as they can no longer legally possess them. Lt. Governor Gavin Newsom, who is running for governor in 2018, helped author the initiative and led the campaign for it. The measure had received nearly 63 percent approval as of mid-November, with some votes still uncounted. In a press conference the day after Prop 63 passed, Newsom made several claims about the effectiveness of Californias gun restrictions. We have significantly reduced the gun-murder rate because of our progressive gun policy, Newsom said, adding that California has seen a 56 percent decline in the gun murder rate since we started to step up and step in and lead the nation in common sense gun safety laws, background checks, restricting large-capacity clips and the like.  Gavin Newsom makes his claim about California's gun murder rate at about the 6:30 minute mark in the video above. We decided to focus on Newsoms claim that California has seen a 56 percent decline in the gun murder rate since it began imposing tough gun laws in the 1990s. Whether those gun laws are the driving force behind such a drop is a matter of mixed opinion. Gun rights groups say tougher criminal penalties, not gun laws, have led to the decline. PolitiFact does not fact-check predictions or opinions.  A Glock 30SF .45 Auto semi-automatic pistol with a Glock 13-round extension magazine installed, and 13 rounds of hollow-point ammunition are seen in Alexandria, Va., Wednesday, Feb. 10, 2016. (AP Photo/Cliff Owen) Our research The gun murder rate measures the number of gun-related homicides per 100,000 residents in a geographical area. A separate measurement, the gun death rate, takes a broader look including homicides, suicides and accidental shooting deaths. Based on our research and contact with Newsoms campaign spokesman, it appears the lieutenant governor mixed up the two rates and ended up understating the drop in Californias gun murder rate by more than 10 percentage points. The states gun death rate -- not the gun murder rate -- dropped 56 percent from 1993 to 2013, according to figures provided by Ari Freilich, an attorney at the San Francisco-based Law Center for Gun Violence Prevention. The attorney cited age-adjusted data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The nonprofit law center advocates for gun control laws and is considered an authority on gun crime statistics. The law centers figures do not include data from 2014, a year in which gun deaths and gun homicides continued to fall in California. Nor do they include statistics from 2015 and 2016, which are not yet available. Still, the 20-year span is the approximate period during which California imposed strict new gun laws, spurred by mass shootings years earlier on a Stockton schoolyard and inside a San Francisco law office. This meant the rate of deaths by any kind of shooting declined from 17.48 per 100,000 residents in 1993 to 7.68 per 100,000 residents. Larger drop in gun murder rate During this same period, Californias gun murder rate declined even faster: By 65 percent, according to a review of the CDCs fatal injury reports by PolitiFact California. If 2014 is included, the rate dropped by 67 percent. Data from these reports have been cited by both gun control and gun rights groups to describe Californias decline in gun violence. They show gun murders fell from 9.60 per 100,000 residents in 1993 to 3.14 per 100,000 in 2014. In raw numbers, this means nearly 2,000 fewer people in California died in gun homicides in 2014 (when 1,233 were killed) compared with 1993(when 3,183were killed). Nationwide, the gun murder rate fell 45 percent during much of the same period. Between 1993 and 2000, it dropped from 7.0 homicides to 3.8 homicides per 100,000 people, according to a Pew Research analysis in 2015 of available federal data. Since then, Pew reported, the rate has remained relatively flat. Our ruling California Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom said California has seen a 56 percent decline in the gun murder rate since it enacted strong gun control laws in the 1990s. Newsom appears to have mixed up the gun murder rate with the gun death rate. Californias gun murder rate dropped 67 percent between 1993 and 2014, according to a review of fatal injury report data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. A similar, though somewhat smaller, drop in the gun murder rate took place nationwide during this period. Newsoms overall point is correct: Gun deaths, including gun homicides, have dropped significantly in California since the state imposed the new laws.  We are not fact-checking the cause of this drop. Gun rights and gun control groups have different opinions on this. What is clear is that gun homicides have declined significantly, and even faster than what Newsom stated.

Final Rating: Half True  ",Images show COVID-19 victims being buried in mass graves in New York City.,"Harrowing images of wooden caskets being lowered into mass graves in New York City circulated on social media as the city responded to the COVID-19 pandemic. The images and related video footage are accurate depictions of recent burials on Hart Island in the Long Island Sound. That said, there have been some misconceptions about the mass graves. Posts about the grave site were flagged as part of Facebooks efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) First, mass burials didnt begin on Hart Island during the COVID-19 pandemic. The city has used the location as a public cemetery for over 150 years, burying unclaimed people and those whose loved ones cant afford private burials. Second, not all locals who die from COVID-19 are being buried there, as some posts have suggested. The site is still designated for deceased people with no known next of kin. But as the city struggles with the mounting death toll amid the pandemic, burials on the island have dramatically increased in recent weeks. There are usually about 25 burials on the island each week, the New York mayors press secretary Freddie Goldstein told CNN. But that number has climbed to nearly 25 each day. The islands interment operation is managed by the citys Department of Correction, and inmates usually assist in the burials. But that has changed since the pandemic. DOC spokesperson Jason Kersten has said that city inmates are not currently involved with the burials: For social distancing and safety reasons, city-sentenced people in custody are not assisting in burials for the duration of the pandemic. Contracted laborers are performing this important work under DOC supervision, according to a report by the Gothamist. Bodies are ordinarily held at the citys morgues anywhere from 30 to 60 days, Goldstein said. But to make room for the influx of deceased individuals during the pandemic, the citys medical examiners office announced a new policy of holding unclaimed bodies for only up to 15 days before they are transferred to the island. New York Citys Hart Island has been used as a public cemetery for unclaimed bodies since the 1800s, but the citys staggering death toll amid the COVID-19 pandemic has dramatically increased the number of burials on the island. Social media posts about the burials are mostly accurate, but many need additional information.",0.5,0.5,1,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,Half True

Final Rating: Mostly True  ",Gov. Romney's plan would cut taxes for the folks at the very top.,"After a flurry of attack ads in the past two weeks, President Barack Obama this week released a TV ad in which he spoke directly into the camera and discussed how his policy approaches differed from Mitt Romneys. He cited taxes as one area where they had different philosophies. Obama said, Gov. Romney's plan would cut taxes for the folks at the very top.Well check whether this is an accurate characterization of Romneys plan.Romney has posted some key elements of his tax plan on his campaign website. Heres a summary of the provisions for individual taxpayers:• Cut marginal rates by one-fifth on a permanent, across-the-board basis• Eliminate interest, dividend, and capital gains taxes for taxpayers with an adjusted gross income below $200,000• Eliminate the estate tax• Repeal the Alternative Minimum TaxTo analyze the Romney tax cut, we turned to the Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center, an independent think tank that evaluates the tax proposals submitted by presidential candidates. The Tax Policy Center looked at two versions of Romneys tax proposal. We will use the analysis of the more recent of Romneys two plans, which the group published in March 2012.The Tax Policy Center ran two sets of numbers, one that gives Romney credit for extending the tax cuts enacted under President George W. Bush and for an annual adjustment in the Alternative Minimum Tax and one that doesn't. Under the analysis that gives Romney credit for extending the Bush tax cuts and the AMT, people in each of the 11 income ranges in the centers study saw a tax cut, with after-tax income increasing by anywhere from 0.3 percent for people who earn less than $10,000 to 19.8 percent for people earning more than $1 million per year. Under the other measurement, which we find is more appropriate, people in eight of the 11 income ranges got cuts -- all except the income ranges below $30,000. For those earning more than that, after-tax income would increase by anywhere from 0.8 percent for those in the $30,000 to $40,000 range to nearly 12 percent for those earning more than $1 million.So Obama is telling part of the story. Yes, there are substantial benefits for people at the top, but he ignores that most people in the middle and lower reaches of the income ladder would benefit as well. Using the calculation that does not give him credit for the Bush and AMT extensions, people earning from $40,000 to $50,000 would see a cut of $512 on average, while taxpayers in the $50,000-to-$75,000 range would see a cut of $1,122.Still, there is support for Obama's point because the Romney tax cuts are tilted toward the wealthy. The biggest winners under Romneys tax plan are those earning more than $1 million. That group accounts for less than 1 percent of all taxpayers, but would receive 26 to 31 percent of the Romney plans tax benefits, according to the Tax Policy Center's calculations.Our ruling Obama is correct that Romneys plan does indeed cut taxes for high-income Americans -- quite heavily in fact -- but the rich arent the only ones who would see a cut. Taxes would be reduced in lower income ranges, too. Still, the plan gives a large share of the benefits to higher income taxpayers.",1.0,0.2,1.0,0.8,0.0,0.3,0.4,1.0,0.7,Mostly True

Final Rating: Mostly True  ","Austin has over 1,000 city employees that make six-figure salaries.","UPDATE 6:15 p.m., Sept. 26, 2014: We revised the story below to note that at a Sept. 23, 2014, forum Wiley said almost 1,000 workers have six-figure salaries. This additional information, pointed out by a reader, didn't change our rating of the claim we checked. Rich rich rich! City of Austin employees strike it rich! Sorry. We got carried away by a claim at a forum for Austin City Council candidates thrown by the League of Women Voters and the City of Austin. According to an Austin American-Statesman news story posted online Sept. 16, 2014, a council candidate, lawyer Jay Wiley, said the day before theres room in the city budget to staff offices in each of the 10 newly created single-member districts. Wiley, running in District 6 in Northwest Austin, also said at the forum: Weve got, actually, over 1,000 city employees that make six-figure salaries. Does that add up? We failed to reach Wiley to learn the origin of his figure. Meantime, city spokeswoman Melissa Alvarado emailed a chart indicating that as of Sept. 1, 2014, 879 workers earned from $100,089 to $304,657. To follow-up queries, Alvarado sent a chart listing 24 vacancies at that time for positions paying $100,000 or more. So, you could say the city had 903 positions paying six figures at the time Wiley spoke. Alvarado said the city then had 11,852 workers, which means its $100,000-plus earners accounted for 7 percent of its workers. Plus, more workers were heading into the six-figure class shortly. To our inquiry, Alvarado said 3.5 percent raises taking effect Sept. 21, 2014, (before the start of the new fiscal year in October) would result in 1,162 employees earning $100,000 or more. At that time, she said, the city expected there to be another 36 open positions paying more than $100,000 each. So at that time, the city projects, 1,198 positions will pay six figures. Alvarado said the city had 12,780 positions budgeted for fiscal 2015. We also looked at which city workers make the most. Peruse that sampling below.

Final Rating: Half True  ","You can't bring an iPad or a piece of paper and a pencil in the (Wisconsin Assembly) gallery to take notes of what's going on, but you can bring a gun up there.","Wisconsin Assembly Minority Leader Peter Barca was railing against Assembly Republicans during an interview on Feb. 19, 2013.Step by step by step, they're dismantling people's involvement in their democracy. And I think it's wrong, the Kenosha Democrat told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel editorial board.Then Barca made a startling claim about rules in the Assembly gallery, where the general public can watch the Assembly in action.You can't bring an iPad or a piece of paper and a pencil in the gallery to take notes of what's going on. That's outrageous, he charged. But, yet you can bring a gun up there. It doesn't even equate. You can exercise your Second Amendment rights, but not your First Amendment rights.So, citizens who want to observe their elected representatives at the state Capitol can bring a firearm into the Assembly gallery -- but not an iPad or a pencil and paper?Was Barca going ballistic?Let's lock and load the Truth-O-Meter.New rulesIn January 2013, about a month before Barca made his claim, he and GOP Assembly Speaker Robin Vos announced they had agreed on new operating procedures for the Legislature's lower chamber.Most any bipartisan agreement would be news, given that Republicans control the Assembly and Senate and hold the governors office.In an effort to avoid all-night sessions, the two Assembly leaders said they would meet before each Assembly session to set time limits on debate for each bill. And they'd use a time clock for each speech.But separate from the bipartisan deal, the Republican majority in the Assembly adopted stricter rules on members of the public in the Assembly's overhead viewing galleries. No recording devices, signs or hats would be allowed, the Journal Sentinel reported.And remaining in place from the 2011-2012 legislative session was a provision allowing people with a valid permit to carry concealed weapons in the Assembly gallery.(The Senate, by the way, prohibits guns -- as well as laptops, still photography and video or audio recordings -- in its gallery.)The Assemblys new prohibitions on recording devices were decried by Bill Lueders, president of the Wisconsin Freedom of Information Council, a nonprofit group dedicated to open government. He noted in an opinion article that the Open Meetings Law passed by the Legislature in 1977 directs all state and local governmental bodies in Wisconsin to make a reasonable effort to accommodate any person desiring to record, film or photograph the meeting, so long as this does not cause disruption.How common are these various restrictions in public galleries in legislative chambers?Angela Andrews of the National Conference of State Legislatures told us she was not aware of any state legislative body that prohibits pencils and paper, and not aware of any that prohibits audio and video recording devices. Fewer than 10 state capitol buildings allow guns, she said.Barcas claimSo, its clear Barca is correct in saying guns are allowed in the audience gallery of the Assembly; no change has been made since that rule took effect in the previous legislative session.But what about the other two parts of his claim?Check two portions of the Legislative Reference Bureaus summary of Assembly Resolution 4, the new rules adopted by the GOP majority in January 2013:No individual may do any of the following in the visitor galleries: lean over or put any object over the balcony; use a laptop or other computer device; stand except for prayer or pledge of allegiance or as otherwise permitted by the presiding officer; use recording devices of any kind; use cell phones or pagers .The laptop or computer device part pretty clearly prohibits the iPad, Apples mobile computing device, in the Assembly gallery.No individual in the visitor galleries may use any audio or video device to record, photograph, film, videotape, or in any way depict the proceedings on or about the Assembly floor.Thats an explicit ban on devices, but theres no reference to jotting notes.Barca spokeswoman Melanie Conklin told us that Barcas key point in making his claim was that there is a lengthy list of items and behaviors – many of them not remotely disruptive – that are banned in the gallery or were discussed in meetings and in the floor speeches as being disruptive, while a visitor can bring a weapon into the gallery with no repercussions.Kit Beyer, spokeswoman for GOP speaker Vos, told us of the new rules: Nowhere does it say that an observer in the gallery cannot have a piece of paper or a pencil.Aiming for clarity on the pencil and paper question, we checked with experts.Madison attorney Christa Westerberg, vice president of the Wisconsin Freedom of Information Council, said its not clear that the new rules would prohibit a pencil and paper in the gallery for taking notes.Chris Ahmuty, the non-lawyer executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Wisconsin, said he has concerns about the new gallery rules but doesnt think they prohibit a pencil and paper.But Madison media lawyer Robert Dreps had a different take. He said its possible to construe a pencil as a recording device.More importantly, nobody but the Assembly can say what its rules actually mean.Because its a legislative rule, it means, ultimately, what the Legislature says it means, Dreps said.  Our ratingBarca claimed: You can't bring an iPad or a piece of paper and a pencil in the (Assembly) gallery to take notes of what's going on, but you can bring a gun up there.He is right that the Assembly audience gallery allows guns and not iPads, but its debatable at best whether hes right that Assembly rules prohibit a pencil and paper.",0.5,0.5,1,0.5,0,0,0.5,1,0.5,Half True

Final Rating: Mostly True  ",Seven presidents before (Barack Obama) -- Republicans and Democrats -- tried to expand health care to all Americans.,"President Barack Obamas health care law has been one of the most polarizing aspects of his presidency, with Republicans criticizing it at every turn. But the keynote speaker at the Democratic National Convention in Charlotte, N.C., San Antonio Mayor Julian Castro, didnt run from it. He applauded Obama for pursuing expanded health care -- and succeeding where his predecessors had failed. Seven presidents before him -- Republicans and Democrats -- tried to expand health care to all Americans, Castro said. President Obama got it done. We wondered whether Castros history was correct. So we checked with a variety of public policy and health care historians and found that Castros in the ballpark -- but that a lot of caveats are in order. Lets start with the presidents who almost certainly fit Castros definition of having tried to expand health care to all Americans. • Harry Truman. On Nov. 19, 1945, Truman wrote a message to Congress saying that the health of American children, like their education, should be recognized as a definite public responsibility. According to the Truman Library, the most controversial aspect of the plan was the proposed national health insurance plan. It called for the creation of a national health insurance fund to be run by the federal government. This fund would be open to all Americans, but would remain optional. Participants would pay monthly fees into the plan, which would cover the cost of any and all medical expenses that arose in a time of need. The government would pay for the cost of services rendered by any doctor who chose to join the program. The American Medical Association attacked the plan, characterizing the bill as socialized medicine. Truman ultimately abandoned the effort after the outbreak of the Korean War • Richard Nixon. In 1971 and 1974, Nixon offered separate proposals to expand health insurance to all, or nearly all, Americans. Generally speaking, they involved employer mandates to provide health insurance, supplemented by subsidies for poorer Americans. I shall propose a sweeping new program that will assure comprehensive health-insurance protection to millions of Americans who cannot now obtain it or afford it, with vastly improved protection against catastrophic illnesses, he said in 1974. The 1974 effort gained some traction in Congress but faltered as Nixon became consumed by scandal. Had it not been for his destruction as a result of the Watergate affair, legislation might well have passed during his presidency, said Princeton University health care historian Paul Starr, the author of Remedy and Reaction: The Peculiar American Struggle over Health Care Reform. • Bill Clinton. In 1993 and 1994, Clinton -- in a process spearheaded by First Lady Hillary Clinton -- sought to pass a major overhaul of the health care system that would have aimed for universal coverage. Even though the Democrats controlled Congress at the time, the plan did not win enactment. So thats an easy three. It isnt much of a stretch to get a fourth: • Lyndon Johnson. Technically, Johnson never sought full universal health care. But it seems churlish to deny inclusion on this list to the man who signed Medicare and Medicaid into law. They arent universal care for everybody, but they are universal care for large subsets of the population. You can add a few more if you lower the bar a bit. • John F. Kennedy. Kennedy voiced strong support for legislation that would ultimately become Medicare. On May 20, 1962, he held a televised rally to push the proposal at a packed Madison Square Garden in New York City. (The American Journal of Public Health later noted that hours later, the AMA rented the empty hall to film a rebuttal by its president, without showing the empty seats.) But he died before the legislation could come to fruition.) • Gerald Ford. Ford endorsed Nixons second proposal, but it didnt get far on his brief watch. • Jimmy Carter. Carter proposed a step-by-step plan to achieve universal coverage, Starr said. It came relatively late in his first term, and it was too weak to satisfy (Democratic Sen.) Ted Kennedy and many other Democrats. Carters efforts were halfhearted, said Brown University political scientist James Morone, co-author of The Heart of Power: Health and Politics in the Oval Office from Roosevelt to Bush. You can actually add a couple more if you bend Castros definition even further. • Theodore Roosevelt. He did endorse the idea of expanding health insurance to all, but only as as a presidential candidate for the Bull Moose Party in 1912, not during his earlier term in the White House. • Franklin D. Roosevelt. In his State of the Union address in 1943, Roosevelt called for a social insurance system that would extend from the cradle to the grave, and he was preparing a program and a speech on national health insurance at the time of his death. In the midst of World War II, Roosevelt never pursued it in earnest, but Truman took up the mantle instead • Dwight Eisenhower. Eisenhower reacted to Democratic proposals for single-payer health care by proposing an expansion of care within the model of private-sector medicine. Eisenhowers approach was to make permanent the tax break for employer-sponsored health coverage (which remains today) in order to encourage as many Americans as possible to get covered through their workplace. For those who were not employed, Eisenhower proposed that the government reinsure private insurance companies to encourage them to add less profitable populations to their coverage rolls. While Morone calls the Eisenhower plan relatively timid, it nonetheless sparked the AMAs opposition, which helped kill it in Congress. The remaining Republican presidents did act to expand health coverage in certain ways, but none of our experts thought they met Castros definition of pushing for universal health care. • Ronald Reagan signed the Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act, which requires hospitals to serve patients in urgent need, and the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act, or COBRA, which allows individuals to keep paying for coverage if they lose their insurance. In addition, with almost no support from his own cabinet, Reagan added catastrophic care to Medicare toward the end of his presidency, though the provision was later repealed. • George H.W. Bush, worried about the Democrats getting traction with health care in a 1991 Senate special election, sent a plan to congress. Bush didn't like the issue, but he had a really good health team that put together a pretty good republican proposal, Morone said. • George W. Bush pushed for and signed the expansion of Medicare to include prescription drug coverage. Putting it all together, you could cut the number to five or raise it to eight depending on how strictly you want to interpret Castros words, Starr said. Our ruling Castro said that seven presidents before (Obama) -- Republicans and Democrats -- tried to expand health care to all Americans. Its a slam dunk getting to three or four presidents, and its possible to reach seven presidents, but to do that requires a looser interpretation of expanding coverage to all Americans.",0.7,0.5,1.0,0.6,0.0,0.3,0.5,1.0,0.8,Mostly True

Final Rating: Mostly True","Says for the coronavirus, the death rate in Texas, per capita of 29 million people, we're one of the lowest in the country.","During a March coronavirus briefing, Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick said the state has one of the lowest coronavirus death rates in the country — a trend he said he hopes will continue through April. If you look at the death rate in Texas, per capita of 29 million people, we're one of the lowest in the country, he said. But we need to continue that for the rest of April. And even be better at that. The first issue here is that Patrick is conflating two calculations in his statement: the death rate for the coronavirus and the number of coronavirus deaths per capita in Texas. The death rate of a particular illness or disease is calculated by dividing the number of fatalities by the number of confirmed cases of the illness. A geographys total population isnt a factor. It is possible to look at the number of coronavirus deaths per capita, but it says less about the danger posed by the virus than the death rate. To give Patrick a fair shake, well take a look at both of these figures and how Texas compares to other states. Patrick did not return a request for comment seeking clarification on his statement. The death rate is generally a function of the number of people infected, said Dr. Myron Cohen, director of the Institute for Global Health and Infectious Diseases at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, in an email. We are often unsure of this because this depends on sampling, and the tests deployed. For this reason, well also look at the number of tests administered by each state. As more tests are administered and more cases are identified, the death rate for the virus will change. Given that the number of cases and fatalities is constantly changing, this fact-check will use data from March 31 — the day Patrick made his statement. Along these lines, it is important to remember that the death rate at this point in time is just a snapshot. Case fatality rates are not constant. They can change considerably during an epidemic if, for example, it is discovered that there are many more milder cases than originally thought, according to a statement from the World Health Organization to PolitiFact at the end of March. The WHO also noted that the rate may vary across different geographies due to demographic factors, for example differences in the age structure of the population. End of March numbers At the time of Patricks remarks, there were 3,266 confirmed cases of the coronavirus in Texas and 41 related deaths reported by state health authorities. This puts the approximate death rate for the virus at 1.26%, meaning 1.26% of people who tested positive for the virus died. Looking at all 50 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico, Texas is among the areas with the lowest coronavirus death rate. Eleven states had a lower death rate when Patrick made his statement, including several with just one death: Wisconsin (1.18%), Missouri (1.06%), Tennessee (1.03%), South Dakota (0.93%), New Hampshire, (0.82%), West Virginia (0.62%), Utah (0.56%), North Carolina (0.53%), Hawaii (0.47%) and Wyoming, which had reported zero coronavirus deaths on the last day of March. It appears that Texas is among the states with low coronavirus deaths, but that is still true of large portions of the U.S. at this point, said Dr. Dhitinut Ratnapradipa, an environmental health professor at Sam Houston State University. At the time of Patricks claim, 29 states had a death rate of less than 2%. The state with the highest death rate on March 31 was Louisiana, with about 5,237 confirmed coronavirus cases and 239 deaths, a rate of 4.56%. Patricks statement also referenced deaths per capita of 29 million people in Texas. Texas is among the states with the fewest deaths per capita, based on March 31 coronavirus data and 2018 1-year population estimates from the Census Bureaus American Communities Survey. When Patrick spoke, there had been fewer than one coronavirus death for every 100,000 people in Texas. The state with the most deaths per capita at the time was New York, with about eight deaths per 100,000 people. But Texas is also among the states that have administered the fewest number of coronavirus tests per capita. At the time of Patricks statement, Texas had administered 42,992 coronavirus tests — about 150 per 100,000 people. New York had administered about 1,050 tests per 100,000 people, or 205,186 tests in total. The number of confirmed cases is directly related to testing, Ratnapradipa said in an email. There is likely widespread community infection of people with no or mild symptoms who are not being tested. This means that we cannot accurately calculate a COVID-19 fatality rate. Cohen said it is important to remember that the current pandemic is dynamic and growing, worldwide and that declaring any kind of victory over the virus is probably a bad idea at this point in time for most places on the planet. Since Patrick made this claim, the number of coronavirus-related deaths in the state has almost doubled, the state confirmed more than 1,000 additional cases and administered more than 10,000 additional tests. Our ruling Patrick said looking at the coronavirus death rate in Texas, per capita of 29 million people, we're one of the lowest in the country. Patricks statement equates the death rate for coronavirus and the number of coronavirus deaths per capita in Texas, two different calculations. It is true that, at the time of Patricks statement, Texas was among the states with the lowest coronavirus death rate (and those with lowest number of deaths per capita) — but not by much. There were 29 states with a death rate of less than 2%. Experts cautioned that the actual coronavirus death rate cannot be accurately calculated until more people have been tested — and Texas is among the states with the lowest number of tests administered per capita. Patricks comparison is accurate based on the information available at the time of his statement, but his claim needs clarification and is missing important context about testing.",0.8,0.5,1.0,0.7,0.0,0.3,0.5,0.9,0.6,Mostly True

Final Rating: True  ",It turns out that Texas has an $18 billion budget shortfall and can't afford its new science textbooks.,"Rocker Alice Cooper famously sang school's out for summer, and on the July 6 episode of The Colbert Report, host Stephen Colbert saluted the noted educator, but amended the lyric. Depending on budget cuts, it could be out forever, he said. We won't take him too literally, since he also said that the Texas State Board of Education revised the state's social studies curriculum standards so the books would no longer say that Sen. (Joseph) McCarthy was engaged in a witch hunt, but, instead, was the star of Bewitched. Still, another claim caught our ear: It turns out that Texas has an $18 billion budget shortfall and can't afford its new science textbooks, he said, as a May 18 Austin American-Statesman article flashed on the screen. Since Colbert has his I's on Edjukashun, a segment on his show about education news nationwide, we wondered whether he got that write. Er, right. When we contacted Colbert to elaborate, a spokeswoman told us that the show was on vacation until July 26, so we forged ahead. First, let's look at the budget shortfall. In a May 11 meeting of the House Appropriations committee, Wayne Pulver, assistant director of the Legislative Budget Board, told legislators the reasons the state is facing a budget gap. The board, which prepares a draft of the budget bill for legislators each session, also crunches the numbers that inform legislative spending decisions. At the hearing, Pulver confirmed that lawmakers will start the next legislative session with a budget gap because of funds that will no longer be available from sizeable sources that helped balance the 2010-11 budget: $6.4 billion in federal stimulus money and $5.6 billion in one-time state funds. Those figures jibe with an analysis the budget board produced in March for the committee. John O'Brien, the board's executive director, pegged the budget gap at $11 billion, but cautioned that his figure assumed no growth in state spending or revenue. At the May hearing, Pulver detailed factors expected to increase the shortfall, including that revenue could fail to meet projections and that spending may increase to accommodate growth in demand for programs like Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program. When committee chairman Jim Pitts, R-Waxahachie, asked whether that could add up to between $15 and $18 billion, Pulver called the range reasonable. Of course, projections are uncertain. In April, Sen. Steve Ogden, R-Bryan, chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, told the San Antonio-Express News in April that the budget gap couldn't yet be defined because you don't know — when you say shortfall, you imply some sort of mandatory spending level and some sort of predetermined revenue level, neither of which we have. There's no shortfall if you don't spend it. And we don't know yet what our revenue projections are. How about them textbooks? On May 21, the education board voted to postpone issuing textbook Proclamation 2012, which calls for the purchase of new science textbooks for kindergarten through 12th grade, according to the Texas Education Agency. The science books were estimated to cost $347 million, in addition to $888 million necessary to cover already-approved English materials, continuing contracts and freight. The state's looming budget deficit, estimated to be $18 billion in the next biennium, pushed the board's decision, according to TEA, and members instead decided to update the current textbooks with supplemental online material that covers the new science curriculum standards the board approved last year for science classes in fifth through eighth grade, plus biology, chemistry, physics and integrated physics and chemistry. What did we learn? Colbert cherry-picked the higher figure of the budget board's latest shortfall projection — $18 billion — but so did the education agency in explaining the education board's decision to delay buying new science textbooks.",1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,True

Final Rating: Mostly True  ","North Carolina during this pandemic had among the lowest COVID-related deaths, as well as job losses per capita.","Gov. Roy Cooper says that, compared to other states, North Carolina has done an exceptional job of preventing job losses and COVID-19 deaths during the pandemic. His comments came during an Aug. 4 press conference after a state official offered an update on North Carolinas rental assistance program. Thanks to you and your team for the hard work, he said. Several months ago, an analysis showed that in states across the country, North Carolina during this pandemic had among the lowest COVID-related deaths, as well as job losses per capita. In a difficult year and amid too much pain, saving lives and jobs has been a point of pride for our state. It shows we follow the science to protect peoples lives without losing sight of their livelihoods. Cooper was referring to an analysis by the research firm Hamilton Place Strategies, according to spokesman Ford Porter. The study, published in April, examined statistics from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the U.S. Department of Labor to compare job losses and COVID-19 deaths in each state. A chart accompanying the study shows North Carolina as one of only a few states where both death and job loss rates were well below the national average, though by the time Cooper spoke in August, those stats were a little outdated. We wondered: How do North Carolinas COVID-19 death and job loss numbers compare to other states as of August? It turns out that North Carolinas numbers are still relatively low. Data compiled by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control shows the number of deaths in each state, as well as the rate of death per 100,000 people. To see what the data looked like on the day of Coopers press conference, we used the Wayback Machine at Archive.org. On Aug. 4, the CDCs most recent data was from Aug. 3. Heres what it showed. Death rate: North Carolina had a lower death rate than the national average, which was 184 deaths per 100,000 people on Aug. 3 and its rate of 130 deaths per 100,000 people ranked 12th-lowest in the country on that date. Only Idaho (123), Colorado (120), Nebraska (117), New Hampshire (102), Washington (80), Utah (76), Oregon (67), Maine (66), Alaska (52), Vermont (40) and Hawaii (37) had lower rates as of Aug. 3. As of Aug. 19, North Carolinas rate was 133 deaths per 100,000 people, still the 12th-lowest in the country. David Wohl, a physician who studies infectious diseases at the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill, says it makes sense to judge a states responsiveness by looking at deaths per capita. He said low rates are influenced by a multitude of factors, from access to care to the general health of the population. NC does have a robust healthcare infrastructure with many local medical facilities and major regional tertiary care centers, Wohl told PolitiFact NC in an email. Testing for COVID-19 has been widely available, leading to potential earlier diagnosis. The state has been very active in administering monoclonal antibody treatment and I suspect we are doing better at this than many other states, possibly preventing progression to more serious disease. North Carolinas unemployment rate is tracked by both the states commerce department and the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. North Carolinas unemployment rate was 3.6% in February 2020, hit a pandemic high of 12.9% in April 2020, and fell to 4.4% in July. In July, 20 states had lower unemployment rates than North Carolina. When Cooper spoke on Aug. 4, the latest unemployment data available was from June. At that time, 21 states had lower unemployment rates than North Carolina. But unemployment rates, which are based on household surveys, dont alone provide a clear picture of each states employment level, says Michael Ettlinger, founding director of the University of New Hampshires Carsey School of Public Policy. There are many otherwise employable people who want employment but who are not out actively looking for jobs because their industry hasnt come back enough to make it worthwhile, Ettlinger said. With variations among states in people starting to seek jobs, differences in the unemployment rate between states can be as much because of those variations as actual job creation. Ettlinger and Jordan Hensley, a policy analyst in his department, recently published a study that examined how many jobs each state lost and recovered during the pandemic. According to their study, North Carolina lost 2.7% of its jobs between February 2020 and June 2021, equal to about 124,000 positions. That percentage is tied for the 10th-lowest among the states, Ettlinger said. Unemployment data released just hours before this fact check reinforce the idea that North Carolinas economy is recovering faster than other states. The latest data show that North Carolina lost only 1% of its jobs between last February and this July, the sixth-lowest percentage in the country. A variety of factors might influence job gains, Ettlinger said. Weather, early COVID-19 rates, current COVID-19 rates, the type of businesses in each state, pre-existing employment trends, and a certain degree of randomness may all play a role in employment levels, he said. Mike Walden, an economist at N.C. State University, says the state may have benefitted from its mix of industries. Sectors like technology, financial services, and education — particularly higher education — largely continued operating. Also, agriculture and agribusiness were deemed necessary and continued their work, Walden told PolitiFact NC in an email.Cooper appointed Walden to a business group that met with him virtually every two weeks. He said Cooper and others in state government worked with and listened to the business community for advice on managing both the economic and health issues of the pandemic. Still, if I was asked prior to the pandemic if NC would have performed so relatively well, I would not have necessarily predicted these very positive results, he said. Cooper said North Carolina during this pandemic had among the lowest COVID-related deaths, as well as job losses per capita. North Carolina was 12th from the bottom among states in the coronavirus death rate, and an analysis by the University of New Hampshire shows that North Carolinas job losses during the pandemic were the 10th lowest among the states. These are not the absolute lowest rates nationally, but both measures can reasonably be described as being relatively low.",1.0,0.0,1.0,0.8,0.0,0.0,0.4,0.9,0.9,Mostly True

Final Rating: Mostly True  ",Income disparities in the United States are the worst since the 1920s.,"U.S. Rep. Bobby Scott voted against a sweeping trade in agreement with Asian nations earlier this month, in part because he thinks it will depress U.S. wages.  Entering into another large-scale trade deal at a time when income disparities in the United States are the worst since the 1920s is not the best course of action for our nation, Scott said in a June 12 statement explaining his votes against the Trans-Pacific Partnership.  We wondered if pay inequality between the very top earners and the rest of workers really is the highest since the Roaring 20s. Similar claims have been sounded this year from both sides of the political aisle and uttered by two presidential candidates who, otherwise, are light years apart: Sens. Bernie Sanders, I-Vermont, and Ted Cruz, R-Texas.  Scotts office backed the claim by referring us to two reports. The first, published earlier this year by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, is a guide to statistical studies on income inequality published by other organizations, including the U.S. Census Bureau and the Congressional Budget Office. All of the studies showed that disparity in the U.S. has been climbing steadily since the 1970s. But there was a problem: most of research didnt go back much further in time and to get to the bottom of Scotts claim, we had to travel back nearly 100 years.  One such time machine exists and the second document referred directly to it. Research by Emmanuel Saez -- an economist at the University of California, Berkeley and recipient of a 2010 genius grant from the MacArthur Foundation -- traces U.S. pay disparity since 1913. Saez and other economists built a database that compiles historic disparity statistics from 30 nations using data from millions of individual tax returns filed over the years.  In 2012, the top 1 percent of U.S. earners made 18.88 percent of the total pre-tax income of the nations tax filers. That was the highwater mark since 1928, when top earners pulled in a record 19.6 percent of all income.  Saez says the 2012 share may have been a slight aberration, in part because many high earners cashed investments to avoid an increase in the capital gains tax that took effect the following year.  In 2013, the top percents share of income was 17.54 percent of total earnings. While that was a slight decrease, it still was the 16th highest mark over the 101 years measured in data base. Its also the latest year available.  The data shows the top earners had at least a 16.68 percent share of total income every year since 2005. The figure was exceeded only one time between 1928 and 2005 -- top earners pulled in 17.64 percent in 1936..  The 16 years in which the top 1 percent had the greatest share of U.S. income are: While Saezs work has become a popular source for politicians to cite when discussing income disparity, some economists are critical of his measurements.  Gary Burtless, an economist with Brookings, a Washington think tank, told us as well as PolitiFact Texas that Saezs data understates income growth of the bottom 99 percent. He noted that Saezs income data is limited to pre-tax private income including wages, self-employment earnings, dividends, interest, rental payments and, in some cases, capital gains.  Whats missing, Burtless said, are other forms of income such as Social Security, unemployment benefits, food stamps, government reimbursement of medical bills and untaxed fringe benefits such as employer contributions to health and retirement plans.  These unmeasured benefits, which almost entirely began in the 1940s -- and, in some cases, decades later -- are far more important for low and middle-income Americans than they are for the very well-to-do, Burtless said.  The CBO, which has been measuring income disparity since 1979, uses a broader statistical formula than Saez. It computed the top 1 percents income at 13.3 percent in 2009 and 14.9 percent in 2010 -- the latest years available. Saez, in comparison, computed the disparity at 16.7 percent and 17.5 percent for the same two years -- an average of about 3 percentage points higher than the CBO.  Average income disparity during the 1930s was less than two percentage points below the average from 2010-2013. So if all forms of income were computed for each era, its possible that that the actual disparity was greater 1930s than it is today.  Our ruling  Scott said, Income disparities in the United States are the worst since the 1920s.  The one database that goes back that far backs up Scott. It shows that, with one exception, the sixteen highest years of disparity between the top one percent of earners and others occurred before 1930 or after 2004.  But its worth noting that the data tends to understate income because it doesnt consider major government and employee benefits that werent offered until the 1940s or later. So its very possible thatbottom-line disparity would have been greater in the 1930s than it is today.",0.7,0.3,1.0,0.6,0.2,0.4,0.5,0.8,0.4,Mostly True

Final Rating: Mostly True  ",Wages are on the rise — in fact we were the top small-business wage growth state in the nation.,"During his recent election announcement for governor of Missouri, Mike Parson trumpeted a strong economy in the state, taking particular care to highlight increases in small-business wages. With record lows in unemployment, more people are going back to work in Missouri, Parson said Sept. 8. Wages are on the rise — in fact we were the top small-business wage growth state in the nation. Does the governors comment check out? We wanted to investigate. A spokesperson for Parsons campaign cited an April 2019 article from St. Louis Business Journal that used numbers from an April 2019 report from Paychex/IHS Market Small Business Employment Watch to show Missouri ranked first in the country in hourly wage growth for small businesses. At $25.55 per hour, Missouri small business wages were up 3.48%, or 86 cents, that month. The Show-Me State finished first ahead of California, New York, Arizona and Illinois in small-business wage growth. According to the Small Business Employment Watchs September report, Missouri now ranks third in the country in hourly wage growth increase at 3.38% (New York is second at 3.53% and Illinois is first at 4.11%). If assessing for weekly wage growth rise, Missouri is second at 3.83%. Illinois comes in at 3.84%, just .01% better than Missouri. Overall, Missouri has been a top-five small business wage growth state (by weekly earnings) every month this year, according to Paychexs analysis. So what is Paychex, and how does it calculate its data for the Small Business Employment Watch? Paychex is a human resources and payroll company with over 600,000 clients nationwide. According to a media spokesperson for the company, it uses up-to-date, aggregated payroll data from approximately 350,000 of Paychex's small business clients with fewer than 50 workers to keep its data current. All businesses whose wage data is included in the report must have run payroll for the month that the data is being compiled and the three months prior. According to a Paychex spokesperson, the sample includes millions of small-business workers. How many small-business workers are there in Missouri and in the United States? It depends what you consider a small business. Paychex defines a small business as a firm with fewer than 50 workers, but the U.S. Small Business Administration defines small businesses as firms with less than 500 workers. According to the SBAs 2019 profile for the state of Missouri, there are 1.2 million small business employees in the state of Missouri alone, and 58.9 million in the country. In other words, while Paychex represents a significant portion of small businesses, its not the whole pie. The company itself claims to work with one in 12 private sector employees. Parson said, Wages are on the rise — in fact we were the top small business wage growth state in the nation. This statement is backed by statistics from Paychex that showed it to be true for the month of April, although Missouri fell behind in later months.",0.7,0.5,1.0,0.6,0.4,0.5,0.5,0.6,0.7,Mostly True

Final Rating: Mostly True  ","It's important to pay attention to the Russian spy drama, but let's not ignore the fact that the following (10) bills have been introduced in the House.","If you inhabit the more liberal corners of social media, you may have seen a list of 10 Republican bills in your feed -- a reminder of the substantive changes that could result from unified GOP control of Washington. Heres the text of a common version thats circulating: OK - It's important to pay attention to the Russian spy drama, but let's not ignore the fact that the following bills HAVE been introduced: 1. HR 861 Terminate the Environmental Protection Agency 2. HR 610 Vouchers for Public Education 3. HR 899 Terminate the Department of Education 4. HJR 69 Repeal Rule Protecting Wildlife 5.

HR 147 Criminalizing Abortion (Prenatal Nondiscrimination Act) 10. HR 808 Sanctions against Iran Please copy/paste and share widely. Call your House Representative and ask them to not only vote NO...but to speak up for our rights, health & safety, and our beautiful country. How accurate is the post? All 10 bills cited do exist, and most (though not all) have been accurately described. But a majority of the bills mentioned havent advanced very far or attracted more than a few co-sponsors, so many are relative longshots for actually becoming law. How accurate are the descriptions? Most of the bills listed are described by their official title, or by a truncated version of the official title. So those strike us as being accurate. But for a few bills, the description is overly broad or misleading. One of those -- H.J.R. 69 -- is described as Repeal Rule Protecting Wildlife. Thats on the right track, but whoever reads this wouldnt know that its specific to certain types of federal land in Alaska. The measure is an effort to overturn a federal rule using the Congressional Review Act, which allows Congress to repeal executive branch regulations under certain circumstances. The measure in question would overrule an Obama administration rule governing non-subsistence taking of wildlife on National Wildlife Refuge land in Alaska. As it happens, this is the only one of the 10 measures that has passed the House already. It passed by a mostly party-line, 225-193 margin on Feb. 16, 2017. It is now awaiting action in the Senate. Another bill with a somewhat exaggerated description is H.R. 785, which is listed as National Right to Work (this one ends unions). Right-to-work laws say workers cant be forced to join a union. They do this by making it harder to form a union, and its true that on average, states that have right-to-work laws have significantly lower unionization rates than states that dont. But its an exaggeration to say that it ends unions. In fact six of the states that have right to work laws have between 10 and 16 percent of their workforces unionized -- Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Michigan, Nevada, and West Virginia. And the remainder of right-to-work states do have unions -- theyre just less common than in the states that dont have a right-to-work law. The third and last of the exaggerated descriptions refers to H.R. 147, which is listed as Criminalizing Abortion (Prenatal Nondiscrimination Act). This bill would criminalize one particular kind of abortion -- one sought based on the sex, gender, color or race of the child, or the race of a parent. Thats not to say its not controversial -- it is. Referring to last years version of the bill, then-Rep. Loretta Sanchez, D-Calif., called the measure an affront to all minority women, especially Latinas and immigrant women, who already face disproportionate barriers to access health care and health education. But contrary to the most obvious reading of the social media post, this bill would not criminalize abortion across the board. How much support do these bills have? A few are likely to go far. For the rest, probably not. Lets start with the bills where eventual passage seems quite plausible. As we noted, the Alaska wildlife measure has already passed the House and must now be taken up by the Senate. Two other bills listed are unlikely to move in the version listed, but the ideas contained within them are likely to be taken up by the GOP leadership on a high-priority basis. One is H.R. 370, which would repeal the Affordable Care Act. H.R. 370 itself doesnt have a single co-sponsor, but repealing Obamas health care law is a high priority for House Republicans. An actual repeal-and-replace bill was released on March 6, and that is the likelier vehicle to be considered by the chamber. The other measure thats likely to advance, but not in the version listed in the post, is H.R. 354, which would stop federal funding for abortion providers such as Planned Parenthood. Federal funding for abortions is already banned, but opponents of abortion say that federal funding should be stopped for non-abortion services provided by clinics that offer abortions. The draft of the Obamacare repeal bill unveiled on March 6 would stop funding for such organizations. Of the other seven bills, none has advanced beyond introduction, and all but one have a minimal number of co-sponsors, all of them Republicans. Heres the rundown, as of March 7, 2017: • H.R. 861 -- Terminate the Environmental Protection Agency -- one sponsor, three co-sponsors. • H.R. 610 -- Vouchers for Public Education -- one sponsor, three co-sponsors. • H.R. 899 -- Terminate the Department of Education -- one sponsor, eight co-sponsors. • H.R. 785 -- National Right to Work (this one ends unions) -- one sponsor, 15 co-sponsors. • H.R. 83 -- Mobilizing Against Sanctuary Cities Bill -- one sponsor, nine co-sponsors. • H.R. 147 -- Criminalizing Abortion (Prenatal Nondiscrimination Act) -- one sponsor, 59 co-sponsors. • H.R. 808 -- Sanctions against Iran -- one sponsor, four co-sponsors. So just one of these bills have attracted co-sponsorship of more than 15 out of the 435 House members. The one that did, on prenatal sex selection, has been introduced for several congresses running and has only moved beyond introduction once. That was in 2012, when the House leadership put it up under so-called suspension of the rules. That means that a bill is fast-tracked to a vote, but to pass, it needs to win two-thirds support. The bill failed to meet the two-thirds threshold; on a mostly party-line vote, it secured 246 votes in favor and 168 votes against. For the rest, its conceivable that these can pass, especially in an environment -- as we have now -- with unified Republican control. Many of these bills address issues that President Donald Trump has advocated. That said, the House has only a limited amount of time, and co-sponsorship and committee consideration are key indications of what ranks high on the leaderships agenda. On these metrics, the remaining seven bills fall short of being considered top-tier priorities. Rather, these bills may have more of an impact in keeping the GOP base happy. John Feehery, a former aide to then-House Speaker Dennis Hastert, said most of the bills on the list seem like click-bait for fundraising to me. I find it it hard (to believe) that they go anywhere. Feehery is now president of the bipartisan lobbying firm Quinn Gillespie Associates. Our ruling The social media post listed 10 bills that it said have been introduced in the House by Republicans. All 10 bills in the post have in fact been introduced. Seven were described accurately, while three had somewhat exaggerated descriptions. Meanwhile, one of the 10 bills has passed, and two seem to be on a fast track, while the other seven are more accurately considered longshots. So the post is largely correct, but it includes some exaggerated language, and it fails to distinguish between top-tier agenda items and priorities further back in the pack.

Final Rating: Mostly True",Tourism and retirees are the dominant economic engines in our state.,"Florida is famous for its tourists and retirees. They spend plenty of bucks in the Sunshine State -- but is the state reliant on them for its economic strength? Former state Sen. Nan Rich, the underdog whos challenging former Gov. Charlie Crist in the Democratic gubernatorial primary, touched on that topic during a speech to the Florida Press Association in Coral Gables on July 11, 2014. (Crist spoke a day earlier; Republican Gov. Rick Scott declined an invitation to speak.) Our states economy is unlike any other in the country, Rich told the association, according to Miami Herald reporter David Smiley who attended the speech. Today, tourism and retirees are the dominant economic engines in our state. And while they do create jobs, they are mostly lower-paying service industry jobs. Since the economy is a top issue in the battle for governor, we decided to check her statement that tourism and retirees are the dominant economic engines in Florida. A look at the data We found no cut-and-dried answers to the question of which sectors are Floridas dominant economic engines. However, we did find evidence that shows tourism and retirees play an important role in the states economy -- too important, some say. Rich told PolitiFact Florida that she was relying on a 2014 report by the LeRoy Collins Institute, a public-policy group at Florida State University, titled, Tougher Choices: Shaping Floridas Future. It was written by professors Jim Dewey and David Denslow with the Bureau of Economic and Business Research at the University of Florida. The report examines state spending, demographics and jobs. Among the conclusions is that Floridas reliance on retirees and tourists comes at a price as the demands of older residents and tourists are disproportionately linked to lower-paid service jobs.  Compared to the rest of the nation, Florida has relatively fewer high-skill high-wage jobs and relatively more low-skill low-wage jobs, many serving tourists and retirees. Without the negative spin, the states official 2013 economic development plan concurs on the importance of tourism and population growth, which has traditionally been driven by retirees. Historically, Floridas economy has been driven by agriculture, tourism, the military, and population growth, which in turn produced gains in construction, real estate, retail trade, and services, the plan says. About 19 percent of Floridas population was at least 65 years old as of 2013, according to the U.S. Census. Bureau. Florida had the highest percentage of seniors in the nation as of 2010. We turned to the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis to look at real gross domestic product by industry in the state of Florida -- the total amount of economic activity by sector, adjusted for inflation. Unfortunately, the data does not include tourism or retirees as an industry. One category that combines arts, entertainment, recreation, accommodation and food service -- a rough approximation of tourism -- produced $46.9 billion in GDP in 2012. That was substantially smaller than the states biggest generator of GDP -- finance, insurance, real estate, rental and leasing, at $161.8 billion. But the latter category also includes some sectors relevant to Richs claim, such as real estate purchased by retirees. Other categories that exceeded the arts and entertainment sector included professional services, education and health care, and government. Some of these also generate economic activity due to seniors, particularly health care. The actual answer, apparently, appears to be more of an assumption than a provable fact. A Visit Florida spokeswoman told PolitiFact Florida that tourism is the states No. 1 industry and generates 23 percent of the states sales tax revenue and employs about 1.1 million Floridians. However, when we asked what economic measures prove that tourism is the top industry, Visit Florida spokeswoman Kathy Torian said: It's an aspirational statement rather than a scientific fact. ... We feel that the combination of sales tax revenue, employment and economic impact from visitor spending make the case for the tourism industry. Experts' views We also interviewed four economists who study the states economy, and they generally agreed that tourism and retirees play a vital role in Floridas economy, though with some quibbles. Bill Seyfried, an economist at Rollins College, said hed prefer the term important engines rather than dominant. Clearly, both tourism and retirees have strong impacts on the Florida economy -- more than most other states -- but the state economy is becoming more diversified as evidence by deeper integration with the global economy, which is likely to get a further boost with the expansion of the Panama Canal, as well as increased growth in professional/technical services, growing aerospace and life-science sectors, he said. Seyfried examined state GDP data from 2011-2013 and found that growth came from many sectors, not dominated by a few related to tourism. One can question whether some of the growth from 2011-2013 reflects a rebound from the crash, but the growth across sectors suggests a lack of overdependence on a few factors, such as tourism and retirees. Kwame Donaldson, an economist at Moodys, told PolitiFact Florida that the states large senior population influences many other aspects of the states economy. Because of Floridas large retiree population, its residents are more dependent on nonwage income than in any other state, which means that long periods of stock market gains (like the one we currently enjoying) provide an extra charge to Floridas economy, Donaldson said. In many, many ways, Floridas economy depends on its senior population, so I think it is accurate to describe this population as an economic engine. Our ruling Rich said, tourism and retirees are the dominant economic engines in our state. We didnt find a simple way to quantify whether tourism and retirees are the dominant economic engine in Florida, but a combination of statistical data and expert analysis suggests that both are important engines, and possibly too important, due to the low-wage jobs they bring.",0.7,0.5,1,0.6,0,0.4,0.5,1,0.6,Mostly True

Final Rating: Half True  ",We borrow money from the Chinese to buy oil from the Saudis.,"Speaking to two of voters' biggest economic concerns, Sen. Hillary Clinton tried to link America's reliance on foreign oil with its need to borrow huge sums from foreign investors, saying, We borrow money from the Chinese to buy oil from the Saudis. That is not a winning strategy for America. It's a great applause line with more than a kernel of truth, but the link between China and Saudi Arabia is not as direct as Clinton suggestions. Let's try to break it down one step at a time. The United States borrows money to keep our economy flush with cash by selling U.S. Treasury notes, bonds and other securities to foreign nations, corporations and private investors. These securities are regarded as among the safest investments in the world, and they bring a decent guaranteed rate of return, to boot. Japan is the biggest foreign purchaser of Treasuries, but China is a solid No. 2 -- it held $405.5 billion worth at the end of 2007. That accounts for about 17 percent of total foreign holdings of all Treasury securities. So it's true that China is a significant lender to the U.S. The U.S. needs the Chinese and other foreign investors because our economy operates on borrowed money to meet all of its consumption needs. This is reflected in the oft-cited trade deficit, and in a less well-known but more accurate measurement called the current account deficit. The current account deficit is the trade deficit plus other things such as military aid. It provides the best picture of how much more the United States economy consumes in goods, services and investments than it's really capable of paying for. The current account deficit hit a record $811.5 billion in 2006 -- the last year for which complete statistics are available -- and has more than doubled during President Bush's years in office. The United States has been running a deficit on this figure since 1991. So, this practice of selling bonds, effectively borrowing money from the foreign countries that buy the bonds, is what keeps capital pumping into the U.S. economy. When China buys those treasuries that makes it possible for other investors, like banks, to loan money to companies that want to buy oil. Energy firms benefit because there is more cash available --at lower borrowing costs-- to purchase crude from producing nations. Clinton's singling out of Saudi Arabia as the primary beneficiary of this transfer of wealth is a bit of a distortion because the Gulf nation is only the fourth-largest supplier to the United States, according to the Energy Information Administration. The United States draws far more from its own domestic sources, and Canada and Mexico. So, it would be a bit more accurate to say the U.S. borrows from China to buy oil from Canada, but what's the fun in saying that? Clinton was trying to make the additional point that the U.S. relies on oil from politically volatile regions. It's clearly a stretch to say the same capital China injects into the economy when it buys Treasury securities somehow winds up in the Saudis' pockets. Clinton might have noted that Saudi Arabia also is a big investor in Treasury securities. That means some of the money we pay for crude oil circulates back to our economy when they buy Treasuries. It's all proof that what goes around, comes around. Although Clinton is correct that China is a big investor in Treasuries, but her statement is misleading because it suggests that we're specifically using Chinese investments to pay for Saudi oil.

Final Rating: True  ",Says his views on reparations for slavery are the same as Barack Obama's and Hillary Clinton's.,"From single-payer health care to free college tuition for all, Bernie Sanders policy proposals have been both dismissed and lauded as radical. But when it comes to reparations for slavery, some fault the Vermont senator and presidential candidate for holding a more conventional view. Sanders opposition to reparations has been the subject of some controversy after Ta-Nehisi Coates called him out in The Atlantic, writing, Unfortunately, Sanderss radicalism has failed in the ancient fight against white supremacy. What he proposes in lieu of reparations — job creation, investment in cities, and free higher education — is well within the Overton window, and his platform on race echoes Democratic orthodoxy. Meet the Press host Chuck Todd followed up with Sanders about Coates column Jan. 24, asking, Why aren't you for reparations because of slavery for African-Americans when you're calling for economic justice on so many other levels? Why do you stop short on that issue? Well, for the same reason that Barack Obama has and the same reason, I believe, that Hillary Clinton has, Sanders responded. And that is, it is absolutely wrong and unacceptable that we have so much poverty in this country and it is even worse in the African-American community. Todd chided Sanders for not answering the question, but Sanders again deflected that it was for the same reasons as Obama and Clinton. Is it true that his position against reparations is the same as Clinton and Obamas views? Sanders is right that Obamas opposition echoes his own. (Coates calls this the conventional Democratic philosophy of a rising tide lifts all boats.)Clintons stance is less direct but largely follows the same rationale. Sanders case against reparations First, lets explain why Sanders is opposed to reparations for African-Americans. When first asked about the issue by Fusion at the Jan. 11Iowa Brown & Black Democratic Forum, Sanders stressed the political impracticability and polarizing nature of the proposal, and suggested prioritizing current economic inequality in lieu of compensating for past injustices. First of all, its likelihood of getting through Congress is nil. Second of all, I think it would be very divisive. The real issue is when we look at the poverty rate among the African-American community, when we look at the high unemployment rate within the African-American community, we have a lot of work to do. So I think what we should be talking about is making massive investments in rebuilding our cities, in creating millions of decent paying jobs, in making public colleges and universities tuition-free, basically targeting our federal resources to the areas where it is needed the most, and where it is needed the most is in impoverished communities, often African-American and Latino. On Meet the Press, Sanders pretty much dropped the pragmatism argument (though he pushed back on the notion that his economic proposals are politically impossible) and focused instead on the second part of his rationale about improving economic conditions and schools for minorities. So how does this mirror, if at all, the approach by Obama and Clinton? Obamas opposition In 2007 and 2008, then-presidential candidate Obama voiced his opposition to reparations, arguing that the best way to amend for the past is to focus on the present and future. I think the reparations we need right here in South Carolina is investment, for example, in our schools, Obama said in a July 2007 CNN debate. Obama couched his opposition somewhat differently in a 2007 NAACP presidential questionnaire. He said that nothing, including reparations, can fully compensate for the stain of slavery before arguing that reparations could lead to negligence on other matters of racial injustices: I fear that reparations would be an excuse for some to say 'weve paid our debt'and to avoid the much harder work of enforcing our anti-discrimination laws in employment and housing; the much harder work of making sure that our schools are not separate and unequal; the much harder work of providing job training programs and rehabilitating young men coming out of prison every year; and the much harder work of lifting 37 million Americans of all races out of poverty. These challenges will not go away with reparations. So while I applaud and agree with the underlying sentiment of recognizing the continued legacy of slavery, I would prefer to focus on the issues that will directly address these problems – and building a consensus to do just that. Obama explains he will not pursue reparations because the action could be used as an excuse not to work on other lingering problems for minorities. Here, Obamas comments sound different from Sanders. Sanders and Obama sound more aligned in these comments by Obama from July 2008, which both Obama and the Sanders campaign pointed out:  You know, I have said in the past — and I'll repeat again — that the best reparations we can provide are good schools in the inner city and jobs for people who are unemployed. And, you know, I think that strategies that invest in lifting people out of the legacy of slavery and Jim Crow, but that have broad applicability and allow us to build coalitions to actually get these things done, that, I think, is the best strategy. You know, the fact is, is that dealing with some of the — some of the legacy of discrimination is going to cost billions of dollars. And we're not going to be able to have that kind of resource allocation unless all Americans feel that they are invested in making this stuff happen. And so, you know, I'm much more interested in talking about, how do we get every child to learn? How do we get every person health care? How do we make sure that everybody has a job? How do we make sure that every senior citizen can retire with dignity and respect? And if we have a program, for example, of universal health care, that will disproportionately affect people of color, because they're disproportionately uninsured. If we've got an agenda that says every child in America should get -- should be able to go to college, regardless of income, that will disproportionately affect people of color, because it's oftentimes our children who can't afford to go to college. Obama, as far as we can tell through searching Nexis, has not changed or revisited his stance on reparations since 2008.  Clintons position Clintons recent and past comments suggest her ideas for helping the black community are no different from Sanders and Obamas. Clinton didnt directly answer the question about reparations at the Iowa Brown & Black Forum, but she also suggested investing in black communities and addressing poverty: I think we should start studying what investments we need to make in communities to help individuals and families and communities move forward. And I am absolutely committed to that. There are some good ideas out there. Theres an idea in the Congressional Black Caucus about really targeting federal dollars to communities that have had either disinvestment or no investment, and have had years of being below the poverty level. Thats the kind of thing Id like us to focus on and really help lift people up. In October 2015, she provided a similar response when asked by the hosts of the BuzzFeed podcast Another Round: Ill tell you what, I think we need to make many more investments in everything from pre-school education to affordable housing, thats my form of trying to give people the chance to be empowered, to make the most out of their God-given potential. As Fusion pointed out, this was largely Clintons answer in 2000 as well. When she was asked about reparations during her Senate campaign, she said African-Americans deserve an apology for slavery before pivoting to economic conditions. But I think that the people I know and the people I work with want us to stay focused on the future, keep our economy going, keep providing good public education, quality affordable health care — do the things that will enable people to have the best futures for themselves, and thats what Im committed to doing. Our ruling Sanders said he opposes reparations for the same reason that Barack Obama has and the same reason, I believe, that Hillary Clinton has. The reason, he said, is the need to focus instead on addressing current economic problems in the black community by improving education, providing jobs and addressing poverty. That is basically what Obama and Clinton has suggested in lieu of reparations. Its worth noting that Sanders previously suggested that reparations were politically impractical and divisive. Obama and Clinton have not made comments to this effect.In 2007, Obama said reparations could be used an excuse not to do more for African-Americans.",1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,True

Final Rating: Mostly False  ","Every time we've increased the minimum wage, we've seen a growth in jobs.","Raising the federal minimum wage is a high priority for President Barack Obama, but the issue is mired in debate over whether or not raising the minimum wage would kill jobs. The federal minimum wage is currently $7.25 an hour, and the White House and some congressional Democrats want to bump it up to $10.10 an hour. As of December, a majority of Americans support a raise. On Election Day, voters in Alaska, Arkansas, Nebraska and South Dakota approved state-level increases to minimum wages. Sen. Ben Cardin, D-Md., wants to see the minimum wage increased, and he defended the idea in an interview on Fox News Sunday Nov. 2, 2014. Every time we've increased the minimum wage, we've seen a growth in jobs, not a loss of jobs, Cardin said. The effect of minimum wage increases on job growth is at the core of this debate, so we wondered if Cardins claim was accurate. As youll see, the data is inconclusive, and there isnt an expert consensus -- even among leading economists. Some data Because Cardin was talking about congressional action, were going to focus on federal minimum wage increases and nationwide job growth. We asked Cardins staff and some economists, and we did some digging around, but there doesnt seem to be any published research that specifically answers the question: Was there job growth every year that Congress increased the federal minimum wage? (Theres plenty of research analyzing individual years, states or industries.) So we turned to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. For every year Congress increased the minimum wage since 1978, we looked at how much employment grew or shrank a year after the new wage went into effect. (The first federal minimum wage went into effect in 1938, but it was not consistent across all industries until 1978.) We know this measure doesnt account for other economic factors or state-level minimum wage increases. But we wanted to look at Cardins claim as literally as possible before turning to the larger debate. Below is a chart showing the years that Congress raised the minimum wage, employment the month that the change went into effect, and employment one year later, as well as the number of months that saw job growth. Year Wage ($) Employment - effective date (thousands) Employment - year later (thousands) Months of job growth Overall growth? 1978 2.65 84,595 88,810 12 Yes 1979 2.90 88,810 90,802 11 Yes 1980 3.10 90,802 91,037 8 Yes 1981 3.35 91,037 90,567 6 No 1990 3.80 109,688 108,367 2 No 1991 4.25 108,367 108,527 8 Yes 1996 4.75 120,677 123,945 11 Yes 1997 5.15 123,604 126,775 12 Yes 2007 5.85 137,984 137,421 5 No 2008 6.55 137,421 130,617 0 No 2009 7.25 130,617 130,395 4 No  So Cardins claim isnt literally true. Increasing the federal minimum wage isnt always followed by national job growth, or loss for that matter. There were 12 solid months of job growth following the 1978 increase, but 12 months of job loss following the 2008 increase. Also, these minimum wage changes did not happen in a vacuum. The last three federal minimum wage increases (2007, 2008 and 2009) were followed by significant job losses, but that was all taking place amidst the global financial crisis. And the minimum wage increases in the 1990s that preceded job growth happened during an economic boom. The debate So what do the experts say? Economists are split over what effect minimum wage has on job growth. Theres some research that shows raising the minimum wage negatively impacts job growth, and a lot that shows it has an insignificant effect. For an idea of how split economists are, look at this University of Chicago poll. Researchers asked about 40 leading economists, if raising the federal minimum wage would make it noticeably harder for low-skilled workers to find employment. In response, 34 percent agreed with the statement, 32 percent disagreed, and 24 percent were unsure. One of the most thorough reports on this debate comes out of the Center for Economic and Policy Research, a progressive think tank. The report concludes that the bulk of the best statistical evidence shows little to no effect on employment when the minimum wage goes up. Those who say raising the minimum wage results in job loss generally follow the logic that when workers become more expensive, businesses will be less likely to hire them, and unemployment follows. David Neumark is an economist who has researched the issue and believes raising the minimum wage reduces employment for the lowest skilled workers. He noted, though, that the economy has grown over the long term, resulting in job growth in all wage and skill levels. The causes of growth, and the business cycle as well, completely swamp (increases to) the minimum wage, said Neumark, director of the Center for Economics and Public Policy at the University of California Irvine. There are a few other things to keep in mind when it comes to minimum wage increases. First, it doesnt affect that many people. Only about 2.6 percent of all wage and salaried workers in the United States are paid at or below federal minimum wage, according to 2013 Bureau of Labor Statistics data. Additionally, 23 states (and some municipalities) have minimum wages higher than the federal minimum wage. Theres also the question of whether or not minimum wage has actually increased. Yes, the sticker price gets higher, but those increases have not kept up with inflation. Adjusted for 2013 dollars, the current minimum wage is a couple of bucks lower than it was in the late 1960s. This Pew Research chart compares minimum wage in 2013 dollars to their unadjusted levels.  All this means that small adjustments to the minimum wage have historically had little effect on employment, said David Gleicher, an economist at Adelphi University who has researched labor economics. Thus there has been virtually no significant increase in prices because of higher costs, nor a significant increase in unemployment, Gleicher said. At the same time, there has not been all that much of an increase in demand causing a significant increase in jobs. Our ruling Cardin said, Every time we've increased the minimum wage, we've seen a growth in jobs, not a loss of jobs. We looked at nationwide employment data in the years following minimum wage increases since 1978, and sometimes there was job growth, and sometimes there was job loss. Modern research tends to show that raising the minimum wage has little significant impact -- positive or negative -- on employment. Cardin got carried away when he said increasing the minimum wage is always followed by job growth.",0.0,1.0,1.0,0.5,0.0,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,Mostly False

Final Rating: Mostly False  ",Pentagon confirms they may court martial soldiers who hold Christian faith.,"No more military chaplains? Soldiers court-martialed for their Christian faith? PolitiFact readers wanted to know if headlines across websites such as Breitbart.com and MrConservative.com last week were true. Pentagon May Court Martial Soldiers Who Share Christian Faith, said Breitbart.com, claiming that the Pentagon has released a statement confirming that soldiers could be prosecuted. It could effectively abolish the position of chaplain in the military, the post said. Pentagon Confirms They May Court Martial Soldiers Who Hold Christian Faith, said MrConservative.com, explaining that the Pentagon has released an official statement affirming that it will court martial 'proselytization. So, did the Pentagon confirm it might court-martial soldiers who hold Christian faith? Welcome to the latest battle for soldiers hearts and minds. Pentagon meeting The recent hubbub has roots in the early 2000s, when a man named Mikey Weinstein watched his sons follow in his footsteps at the U.S. Air Force Academy in Colorado Springs. The Jewish students both faced Christian proselytizing, the family says, and in some cases, anti-Semitic slurs. An Air Force task force investigated accusations that the academy created a discriminatory climate, after a 2004 survey showed cadets complained that evangelical Christians had pressured Jews and other Christians. It found a need for policy guidance for commanders and supervisors regarding religious expression, not just at the academy, but across the Air Force. In 2005, Weinstein — a former Air Force attorney who worked in President Ronald Reagan's administration — unsuccessfully sued the Air Force for failing to prevent proselytizing. In 2006, he turned his attention full-time to his nonprofit Military Religious Freedom Foundation, saying he was fighting off far-right militant radical evangelical religious fundamentalists. (He also writes about fundamentalist Christian monsters who unite around horrific hatred and blinding bigotry, which doesnt exactly endear him to groups he targets, such as the Family Research Council.) Fast-forward to a Washington Post blog in late April. Sally Quinn, who writes about religion for the Washington Post's On Faith blog, spoke with Weinstein and others on their way to meet with several generals and a military chaplain. Weinstein had asked for months for the April 23 sit-down, which included his board members Larry Wilkerson, a former chief of staff to Colin Powell, and Joe Wilson, a former ambassador. The three planned to exhort the military to punish proselytizing. They pointed Quinn to examples such as a chaplain telling troops — including Afghan soldiers — to get right with Jesus, Marine officers changing the name of their attack squadron to the Crusaders (Weinsteins group got them to change it back) and a military contractor putting references to the New Testament on gun sights (again, Weinstein fought to have them removed). Its a workplace violation, Wilson said. This is a national security threat, Weinstein said. Weinstein also got an officer to remove an atheist bumper sticker from his car because it bothered an evangelical Christian. But, the men argued, the military itself needed to do more to protect troops who feel their religious freedom is undermined. Quinn quoted Wilson: You need half a dozen court-martials real quick. Quinns post, published Friday, April 26, caught the attention of Fox News Radio commentator Todd Starnes. Monday, April 29, he asked the Pentagon: Is there a plan to court-martial chaplains who proselytize? Heres what the Defense Department spokesman Nate Christensen told him: The Department of Defense places a high value on the rights of members of the Military Services to observe the tenets of their respective religions and respects (and supports by its policy) the rights of others to their own religious beliefs, including the right to hold no beliefs. The Department does not endorse any one religion or religious organization, and provides free access of religion for all members of the military services. Court martials and non-judicial punishment are decided on case-by-case basis and it would be inappropriate to speculate on the outcome in specific cases. However, religious proselytization is not permitted within the Department of Defense. Starnes wrote: The Pentagon confirmed to Fox News that Christian evangelism is against regulations. Religious proselytization is not permitted within the Department of Defense, LCDR Nate Christensen said in a written statement. He declined to say if any chaplains or service members had been prosecuted for such an offense. Court martials and non-judicial punishments are decided on a case-by-case basis and it would be inappropriate to speculate on the outcome in specific cases, he said. The Internet took over from there. Weinstein had been hired by the Pentagon to help shape policy on  religious tolerance, said Investors Business Daily. (Not true.) President Barack Obamas Defense Department was promising to bring criminal charges against any military personnel who express or share their faith, said a PA Pundits blogger. (Also not true.) And an anonymous blogger at MrConservative.com, citing Breitbart.com, declared, Pentagon Confirms They May Court Martial Soldiers Who Hold Christian Faith. PolitiFact reached out to Nate Christensen at the Defense Department, who said his statement was grossly taken out of context. On May 2, he clarified: Service members can share their faith (evangelize), but must not force unwanted, intrusive attempts to convert others of any faith or no faith to one's beliefs (proselytization). If a service member harasses another member on the basis of race, color, sex, religion, national origin, age, or disability, then the commander takes action based on the gravity of the occurrence. Likewise, when religious harassment complaints are reported, commanders take action based on the gravity of the occurrence on a case by case basis. ... We work to ensure that all service members are free to exercise their Constitutional right to practice their religion in a manner that is respectful of other individuals' rights to follow their own belief systems; and in ways that are conducive to good order and discipline; and that do not detract from accomplishing the military mission. Weinstein, he said, wasnt part of any Defense Department advisory group or committee, nor was he a consultant on religious issues. Theres a line there The military has grappled for years with how to balance the rights of people exercising different religious beliefs, or no beliefs. Weinsteins group had urged the Pentagon to enforce a recent Air Force policy on government neutrality regarding religion. He wants to see courts-martial under the Uniform Military Code of Justices Article 92, Failure to Obey Order or Regulation, for those who dont follow orders not to proselytize. Rules in place since last year say that Air Force leaders must avoid the actual or apparent use of their position to promote their personal religious beliefs to their subordinates or to extend preferential treatment for any religion. Meanwhile, all airmen are able to choose to practice their particular religion, or subscribe to no religious belief at all. You should confidently practice your own beliefs while respecting others whose viewpoints differ from your own. Rules for military chaplains already reflect this tightrope act. Theyre affiliated with outside religious organizations, but must support troops of all faiths. They're very careful about how they offer advice, said Lori Bogle, an associate history professor at the U.S. Naval Academy who writes about religion and the military. They are more like counselors. And if a person expresses a religious interest, they might go there. Thats been the general policy as long as she knows — even back to the 1940s. But in times of stress, the military has briefly embraced evangelism, such as during the early Cold War, when character guidance programs and seminars took on an overtly Christian cast in response to an atheist enemy. But that stopped by the mid 1960s, she said. So, its not necessarily new or surprising the Pentagon would say proselytizing isnt permitted. But groups such as the Family Research Council argue the policy outlined by the Defense Department spokesman last week is incoherent, asking how the military will distinguish between evangelizing and proselytizing. It has launched a petition to urge the defense secretary from censoring the full solace of the gospel. Meanwhile, a Coast Guard rear admiral, William Lee, spoke last week of his discomfort with current rules — he wants to be able to hand Bibles to suicidal servicemen. Ken Klukowski, director of the Center for Religious Liberty at the Family Research Council, says millions of Christians, including evangelicals, devout Catholics and observant Mormons, believe they are required by the New Testament to share their faith with others. This is to be done respectfully and peacefully, at appropriate times and in an appropriate manner, but it must be done when such opportunities present themselves, he wrote. To say that sharing the gospel is a crime under military law  is to say that tens of millions of Americans are not allowed to serve in our military. So, to some, to hold Christian faith is synonymous with promoting that faith to co-workers and subordinates. Under that interpretation, they could theoretically face court-martial if others found their attempts intrusive or harassing. But so far, Weinsteins urging hasnt resulted in such a court-martial. Our ruling Recent headlines and articles offered versions of the claim that the Pentagon confirms they may court-martial soldiers who hold Christian faith. Instead, a Defense Department spokesman had explained that proselytizing — unwanted, intrusive attempts to convert others — wasnt permitted and that punishment for breaking military rules is decided case by case. Conservative religious groups argue this means sharing the gospel would become a crime. But no policy we saw suggests that the Pentagon would court-martial soldiers who hold Christian faith. Quite the opposite — much of the language from the Defense Department reinforces the right of military members to practice their religion, as long as its in a way that respects others belief systems. Chaplains already follow such rules. Still, theres a sliver of truth — if you believe your Christian faith compels you to try to convert others in a way people find harassing, its possible you could face court-martial, though such a thing has yet to happen.",0,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,Mostly False

Final Rating: Half True","Says Joe Donnelly voted to grant amnesty to millions of illegal immigrants, including criminals, drunk drivers, domestic violence, and worse.","A digital ad by One Nation, a Republican PAC, in the Indiana Senate campaign claims Democrat Joe Donnelly flip-flopped on the issue of amnesty for illegal immigrants. In Congress, Joe Donnelly claimed he was 100 percent opposed to amnesty and promised to send back any illegal immigrant who commits a crime, the narrator says as a hooded man walks along a dark sidewalk holding a knife on screen. But in the Senate, Donnelly voted to grant amnesty to millions of illegal immigrants, including criminals, drunk drivers, domestic violence, and worse, the narrator continues as a man climbs over a tall fence and another is handcuffed. Donnelly has frequently stated he opposes granting amnesty to criminals. So did he really vote to let them legalize their status? The bill in question is the 2013 Border Security, Economic Opportunity, and Immigration Modernization Act, which gave provisional legal status to those who entered the country illegally. The legislation was a major bipartisan compromise from a group known as the Gang of 8, which included Senators John McCain, Lindsey Graham and Marco Rubio. Donnelly voted in favor. While it passed the Senate, it never reached a vote in the House. The Donnelly campaign said Donnelly has consistently opposed amnesty and said this bill did not grant amnesty. He supported it because it increased border security. He only supported the 2013 bill because it wasn't amnesty and instead placed renewed focus on identifying and deporting hardened criminals -- including drunk drivers and domestic abusers, said Will Baskin-Gerwitz, Donnellys spokesman. Amnesty is a tricky word. Experts told us earned path to legalization was more appropriate in this case. In addition to border security, the bill did provide a way for people in the country illegally to apply for legal status. The bill allowed qualified unauthorized immigrants to apply for registered provisional immigrant status. After 10 years, they could apply for a green card. Eligible for that status were undocumented immigrants who had been in the United States since Dec. 31, 2011, paid their assessed taxes, passed background checks, and paid application fees and a $1,000 penalty. Prohibited from the path to citizenship were those convicted of three or more misdemeanor offenses, as well as those convicted of felonies, certain foreign offenses or unlawful voting. The ad said Donnelly granted amnesty to criminals, drunk drivers, and perpetrators of domestic violence. Thats not the case. Criminal is a loaded term, as it may bring to mind a person with a serious criminal record. Legally, a misdemeanor is a crime. So technically, a person with a misdemeanor would be considered a criminal. The legality of the images on screen vary. Carrying a knife isnt a crime, but stabbing someone is a felony. Trespassing is generally a misdemeanor, depending where the person is trespassing. A person with a record of two misdemeanor charges could apply for provisional legal status, while the third count would make them ineligible. As for drunk driving and domestic violence, James Alan Fox, a professor of criminology at Northeastern University, said they could be considered a misdemeanor or a felony, depending on the state in which they occurred and sometimes, the level of violence. But the bill had more specific language carved out for those crimes. It said that a person with three or more drunk driving offenses was inadmissible. They would also be ineligible if they served at least one year in prison for domestic violence, or were convicted for it more than once. U.S. Rep. John Cornyn, R-Texas, introduced an amendment that curbed the criminal allowances using stronger language; anyone convicted of domestic violence or drunk driving would be ineligible. Donnelly voted againstCornyn'samendment. Without the amendment, more individuals convicted of crimes, including domestic violence and drunk driving, would get to apply for legalization, said Sarah Pierce, a policy analyst at the Migration Policy Institute. Experts told usCornyn's amendment was apoisonpill that would have made the legalization program impossible. It would have required before legalization could move forward a 90 percent apprehension rate at the Southern border. The 90 percent standard, for example, was intended to sink the bill by creating an impossible standard, said Ian Ostrander, a political science professor at Michigan State University. Often these amendments are created with the intended purpose of using the motion to table vote in a campaign ad. One Nation said, In the Senate, Donnelly voted to grant amnesty to millions of illegal immigrants, including criminals, drunk drivers, domestic violence, and worse. Donnellys vote for the immigration bill excluded drunk drivers with multiple offenses and those convicted of domestic violence from the path to citizenship. He voted against an amendment that would have excluded more people charged with such crimes from attaining citizenship. The ad makes it seem that Donnelly purposely protected all undocumented immigrants convicted of domestic violence and drunk driving. The vote he cast still went after them, but in a less severe way than the Cornyn amendment proposed.",0.5,0.7,0.8,0.6,0.6,0.7,0.5,0.9,0.5,Half True

Final Rating: Mostly True  ",Says Texas school districts are the fifth largest employers in the world.,"Framing his case for slimming school district staffs, GOP state Sen. Dan Patrick aired what the Texas Tribune called a staggering statistic--that the states school districts are the fifth largest employers in the world.We paused too at Patricks statement, as paraphrased in a Feb. 25 Tribune news article.Patricks chief of staff, Logan Spence, told us by e-mail that Patricks assessment tracks with a Jan. 18, 2011, press release from the Texas Conservative Coalition Research Institute, a conservative Austin-based think tank. The release says the Texas public school system is the fifth-largest employer in the world with 646,815 employees. It is behind Wal-Mart Stores Inc., China National Petroleum, State Grid Corp. of China and the United States Postal Service. Its referenced study says: If the Texas public education system were a private company, it would be the fifth largest in the world by employee count.The study says it bases its school employee count on the Texas Education Agencys 2008-09 pocket guide to school statistics and traces its 2008 counts for the worlds largest corporate employers to a July 2009 Fortune magazine look at the worlds largest private employers--all which we confirmed before obtaining more recent numbers from the magazine and the TEA.And for national perspective, we looked at state-by-state public school employee counts for 2008-09 posted by the National Center for Education Statistics. That year, according to the center, Texas had 660,000 public school employees with California having the second-most, nearly 598,000.TEA spokeswoman Debbie Ratcliffe passed along the states 2009-10 count of full-time district employees, 661,285; she said the agency doesnt have comparisons to private employers.In July 2010, Fortune magazine issued its latest breakdown of the worlds most profitable 500 companies. Wal-Mart was No. 1 among them in employees as of that date, with 2.1 million workers, followed by China National Petroleum, at more than 1.6 million workers, State Grid Corp., Chinas primary power grid builder and operator, at 1.5 million, and the U.S. Postal Service, 667,605. The fifth-largest company was Sinopec, a Chinese refining and gas company, with 633,000 workers. China National Petroleum refers to itself as a state oil company and State Grid says on its website that its government owned. Fortune says on its methodology summary that entities qualify for consideration if they must publish financial data and report their figures to a government agency.So Texas school districts together had more employees last year than all but four of the worlds for-profit enterprises.Fair comparison? Ratcliffe suggested otherwise, noting that every school district operates independently. A more valid approach, she said, would be to compare school employees with airline employees, or workers in some other industry. We thought of similar analogies: employees of fast-food companies, say, or day-care workers or law enforcement officers.Next, we ran Patricks statement by education experts and advocates.Peggy Johnson, associate dean for teacher education at Texas Tech Universitys College of Education, said school districts arent as monolithic as corporations. Wal-Mart is Wal-Mart, but in Texas youve got very independent school districts, Johnson said, so its not the same as everybody being employed by the same company.Catherine Clark, associate executive director for the Texas Association of School Boards, said in an e-mail that while its a little unusual to aggregate over 1,000 separately governed working units and compare them with Wal-Mart or an international energy company, its not surprising the Texas public education system employs so many people. The enterprise is large, far-flung and diverse, she said. Its success depends on people--teachers, administrators, and support staff who provide an appropriate education program and safe facilities for nearly 5 million students.Ken Zornes of the 22-year-old Texas Business Education Coalition, which describes itself as the voice of the states business community for educational gains, said: You can walk into almost any business and find some ways to be more efficient. Im sure thats true with all the employees in the (Texas) education system.When we followed up with Patrick, he called his statement fair. Its a perfectly legitimate comparison, he said. The point is made: Our schools employ lots of people.Yep, and the math behind his statement looks solid. Still, we find it questionable whether any workforces in the public sector, where the goal is supposed to be public service, are directly comparable to those in private sector, where the goal is to make money.",1.0,0.2,1.0,0.8,0.0,0.3,0.5,1.0,0.7,Mostly True

Final Rating: Mostly False","The Stupak Amendment doesn't just say you can't use your federal insurance subsidy to pay for an abortion, it says, if you're getting a federal subsidy of any kind, you're not allowed to buy an insurance plan that covers abortion even with your own money.","An amendment to the House health care bill about abortion coverage continues to inspire political passions, driving a wedge between abortion-rights supporters who are outraged at what they consider a major loss for women's rights, and Democratic lawmakers who dread seeing their long-awaited reform effort potentially stalled due to the highly controversial debate.We've examined the role of  abortion coverage in the health care debate  numerous times, specifically as it relates to this amendment, including  a recent claim by Rep. Nita Lowey  . But on Nov. 12, 2009, MSNBC host Rachel Maddow addressed the issue again, and we thought we'd take another crack at it.Congressman Stupak and his supporters say that this Stupak Amendment would simply maintain the status quo, Maddow said on her show. It should be noted that that's baloney. The Stupak Amendment doesn't just say you can't use your federal insurance subsidy to pay for an abortion, it says, if you're getting a federal subsidy of any kind, you're not allowed to buy an insurance plan that covers abortion even with your own money. That's the first bit of dishonesty going on here.The amendment, sponsored by Reps. Bart Stupak, D-Mich., and Joe Pitts, R-Pa., was a last-minute addition to the House legislation and passed due to support from Republicans and antiabortion Democrats. It establishes restrictions on how abortion can be covered under the bill's virtual health insurance exchanges. These exchanges are designed to help people buy coverage if they are not currently insured, or if they work for businesses that are too small to offer health coverage to employees.Essentially, the Stupak-Pitts amendment bars abortion coverage for those who choose the public option, which is the House bill's federally administered, but privately funded, insurance plan. (Cases of rape, incest or a danger to the life of the mother are exempted.) The amendment also prevents anyone who accepts federal subsidies for health coverage from purchasing a plan with abortion coverage on the exchange.However, the amendment does allow people purchasing insurance on the exchange to choose a plan with abortion coverage if they pay for it without federal subsidies. Those who do accept subsidies can purchase an abortion rider -- that is, a separate policy covering abortion -- as long as they pay for it entirely with their own money.Many supporters of abortion rights argue that the amendment represents a severe infringement on a procedure that has been upheld by the Supreme Court. They say that relatively few women will be able to buy insurance on the exchanges without subsidies, making the exception for unsubsidized purchases close to meaningless. And they say that the idea of a rider isn't all it's cracked up to be. For one thing, abortion-rights supporters argue, women won't be likely to purchase separate coverage for a procedure they never expect to need. In addition, they say, insurance companies will be unlikely to offer abortion coverage because of the bill's logistical hurdles. For instance, the bill requires that insurers offering plans on the exchange that cover abortion also have to offer an identical plan that does not cover abortion.All of these factors, abortion-rights supporters say, indicate that insurers will simply take the path of least resistance and decline to offer abortion coverage. If this happens, the law could end up diminishing the abortion coverage options for people on the exchange.In our previous ruling, we drew a distinction between what the law does and what might possibly happen in the law's wake. The law spells out quite clearly that abortion coverage can be obtained on the exchange, even by those who are subsidized. By contrast, the notion that low demand for, and low supply of, abortion coverage could hamper women's access to abortion struck us as a different matter. We concluded that it's too speculative to say that this scenario will definitely come to pass.As we look at Maddow's statement, we'll start by giving her credit for using more careful wording than have many of her fellow abortion-rights supporters, including the subject of our prior fact-check, Rep. Nita Lowey, D-N.Y. Whether by design or not, Maddow hewed quite closely to the actual language of the amendment when she said that if you're getting a federal subsidy of any kind, you're not allowed to buy an insurance plan that covers abortion even with your own money. In fact, the amendment text does, on eight separate occasions, make a distinction between a plan and supplemental coverage.Specifically, the amendment says that people who buy subsidized insurance on the exchange cannot buy an insurance plan that includes abortion coverage. But the amendment does allow subsidized people to purchase supplemental coverage that covers abortion, as long as they do it with their own money.We believe that Maddow's failure to mention the option of buying supplemental coverage -- a rider -- undercuts her broader argument that if you're getting a federal subsidy of any kind, you're not allowed to buy an insurance plan that covers abortion even with your own money. We'll concede that the amendment's language does draw a distinction between buying a plan and buying supplemental coverage, but the difference is likely to be lost on viewers without expertise either in the insurance business or in legislative drafting.We ran our argument by Maddow. She gamely disagreed.I absolutely stand by my comment, she wrote in an e-mail. Get real, you guys. It's crazy to argue that the real impact of the Stupak Amendment will be that women receiving federal subsidies (probably the vast majority of women in the exchange) will just buy 'abortion insurance,' since abortion wouldn't be covered as health care under their health insurance anymore. Women are really going to get a specific insurance rider that they'd pay for every month, for a procedure no one ever plans on having or thinks they'll ever have to have? Really? Come on.But we think her response only strengthens the argument that the law isn't, itself, barring abortion coverage. Saying, as she does, that the burden of purchasing or not purchasing abortion insurance would fall to women tacitly confirms that the law does indeed allow subsidized women on the exchange to buy abortion coverage.Meanwhile, contrary to suggestions that insurers won't offer abortion riders, our research shows that they do exist in at least three of the five states that already have rules similar to the Stupak amendment on the books. In Oklahoma and Kentucky -- both of which which bar insurers from offering elective abortion coverage as part of a comprehensive plan -- regulatory officials told PolitiFact that such riders do exist, because insurance companies must file paperwork with the state before they sell such policies.In addition, Paula Gianino, president and chief executive for Planned Parenthood of the St. Louis region, told the  St. Louis Beacon  that she estimates 7 percent to 10 percent of the roughly 6,000 abortions provided annually at its St. Louis facility are covered by private insurance. Since companies in Missouri are banned from purchasing plans with abortion coverage except by rider, these examples show that some abortion riders are being purchased in that state.However, none of these states keeps track of how many companies offer the riders, or how many people have purchased them.Ultimately, we'll give Maddow credit for linguistic care, but we continue to hold that the Stupak Amendment does not, as she suggests, prevent subsidized women on the exchange from buying abortion coverage. They can buy a rider that adds that coverage.  Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

Bushs last acts in office was signing the non-controversialWilliam Wilberforce Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of 2008, which contained a provision guaranteeing formal deportation hearings for child immigrants not from Mexico and Canada and without family in the United States. This guaranteed hearing is now at the center of the crisis on our southern border, as thousands of children stream into this country from Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador. On the July 23 edition of Last Word, MSNBCs Lawrence ODonnell pointed to discussion of the 2008 Bush law as an example of the misinformation Republicans are spreading on immigration. ODonnell played a clip where Rep. Mo Brooks, R-Ala., implies that the 2008 law -- which was intended to provide protection for victims of sex trafficking -- shouldnt apply to the children presently crossing the border. Theres no evidence, Brooks said, that this 60-to-90,000 illegal alien children mass that has come to America are coming here to be sex slaves or something of that nature. ODonnell took Brooks statement to what he saw as a logical conclusion. One of the positions that these Republicans are holding, ODonnell said, is that they want to repeal the law that President Bush signed, which is about protecting children from sex trafficking. So they want to be on record as not wanting to protect children from this kind of sex trafficking. We were skeptical that the Republican position is to repeal the 2008 law entirely, so we decided to dig deeper. What happens when a child arrives at the border When unaccompanied minors from Mexico and Canada are apprehended at the border, theyre screened by Border Patrol within 48 hours to determine whether they are victims of trafficking or have credible asylum claims. Those that do get a formal hearing, and those that dont are bussed back, often within 12 hours of their arrival. The process for children from other countries starts the same, with an initial Border Patrol screening. But the 2008 law mandates that these children -- most of them from Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador -- are sent to the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) after their screening, regardless of whether or not they have asylum claims.  The HHS subjects these children to a more thorough medical check, and then the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) transports them to a HHS shelter. From there, the children are released to relatives or other sponsors to await their guaranteed hearings. These hearings often dont occur, though, for years, and shelters are getting overcrowded -- this is what pundits are referring to the immigration crisis. Compared to the roughly 3,000 non-Mexican minors apprehended at the border in 2009, the tens of thousands of minors crossing the border now are simply too much for the DHS and HHS to process. Laws are complicated While the provision dictating border policy is getting most of the attention, theres more to the 2008 law. It also renewed funding for a 2000 anti-trafficking bill and laid out plans for sanctions and research to combat trafficking. Theres an ongoing debate about whether the Obama administration is properly enforcing the letter of the 2008 law. Conservatives and groups such as the Center for Immigration Studies, which supports tighter immigration enforcement, say the 2008 law guarantees hearings only forunaccompanied alien childrenwho do not haveparents or legal guardians in the United States. Yet, according to the center, up to77 percent of non-Mexican children arriving at the border without family members are being released to family members within the United States. These children, they argue, shouldnt be eligible for a hearing. Its unclear to what extent the 2008 law is the cause of the backlog of children -- but as weve addressed elsewhere, its certainly a major factor. What Republicans have proposed ODonnell is right insofar that Republicans have honed in on the 2008 law as a major source of the current immigration crisis. But the prevailing thought among Republicans is that the law should be amended, not repealed. House Speaker John Boehner said July 17 that Congress couldnt begin to mitigate the problem at the border if you dont do something about the 08 law thats being abused. And it is being abused. The only Republican we found saying the law should be repealed is Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz. We insist on having the 2008 law repealed as part of any immigration bill, McCain saidon July 11. Senate Democrats, he said,are not willing to do that. But it is fairly clearMcCain misspoke. Legislation proposed by McCain and Sen. Jeff Flake, R-Ariz., specifically calls for amending the 2008 law, not repealing it, and McCain spokesman Brian Rogers told us on July 30that McCain wants to amend the 2008 law. Other formal proposals from the GOP all call for revising, not repealing the2008 law. Some Democrats, including Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.V., also support revising the law. There have been nine proposals related to the 2008 law from Republicans in the Senate and the House. And, according to Grant Newman of immigration research group NumbersUSA, all of these proposals involve amending the 2008 law, albeit in different ways. There have been no formal proposals, Newman said, for repeal. Most of the Republican attempts, their whole goal is to try to treat children from Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras and in some cases, any child, like we treat Mexican nationals, where we can expedite removal, Newman said. A proposal by Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, and Rep. Henry Cuellar, D-Texas, for example, would eliminate the distinction between countries of origin. Under their proposal, called the HUMANE Act, all children -- not just those from Mexico and Canada -- would be screened by the Border Patrol within 48 hours, and those without claims to amnesty or evidence that theyve been trafficked would be removed as soon as possible, like Mexicans are under current law. Children who pass the Border Patrol screening would be submitted to a second screening within seven days in front of a judge, with a higher burden of proof than the Border Patrol screening but a lower burden than a formal hearing. Migrants who meet that burden of proof would be sent to the HHS to await a formal hearing as in current law, and migrants who dont would be removed. A House GOP working group formed by Boehner and led by Rep. Kay Granger, R-Texas, has released similar recommendations. The working group recommended an amendment to the 2008 law so all unaccompanied minors are treated the same as Mexicans for the purpose of removals. So the Republicans who want to change the 2008 law have all proposed revisions, not repeal. Its worth noting that Congress rarely repeals laws in full -- theyre too complicated for that -- but ODonnell still mischaracterized Republicans stance on the 2008 law. Protections for trafficking victims ODonnell does, though, have something of a point that Republicans are removing protections for victims of sex trafficking. Opponents of the Republican proposals about the 2008 law break mainly into partisan camps. According to NumbersUSA, many Republicans are unconvinced that the 2008 law even applies to the surge children, the majority of whom arent unaccompanied alien children under federal law. The burden to fix the immigration crisis, they say, falls solely on the executive branch. Democratic opponents of these proposals -- including Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid -- have pointed instead their injustice towards child migrants. Sen. Robert Menendez, D-N.J., for example, criticized the HUMANE Act, saying it undermines the due process rights of a child that exists under existing law. And advocates from Texas immigration rights group LUPE criticized the HUMANE Act on the grounds that it doesnt provide children enough time to open up to officials. They gave the example of Sara, a sex-trafficking victim who wasnt identified as such until she spoke to a social worker two months into her detention. Under the Cornyn-Cuellar proposal, they said, Sara would have been sent back to her abusers. But while proposals to revise the 2008 law may get rid of some safeguards for victims of sex trafficking, they dont get rid of all of them. Current law gives immigrants from Mexico the opportunity to make their case when screened, and Republican proposals would give Central American children at least that much protection. The GOP working groups recommendations, for example, would give children who dont want to be returned to their home countries a screening by child welfare professionals and an expedited removal hearing within seven days after that screening. Our ruling ODonnell took a soundbite from Republican congressman Mo Brooks to mean that Republicans want to repeal the law that President Bush signed in 2008 to protect victims of sex trafficking. ODonnell concluded that Republicans want to be on record as not wanting to protect children from this kind of sex trafficking. Republicans want to amend, not repeal the 2008 law. But its an open debate what these changes would mean for victims of sex trafficking. These proposals leave Central American children with some protections, but without what human rights advocates have characterized as a major protection.",0.5,0.7,1.0,0.5,0.6,0.6,0.4,0.8,0.5,Mostly False

Final Rating: Half True  ",Says Georgia has more day-of voting rights than Colorado.,"Republicans are heaping scorn on Major League Baseball for moving the All-Star Game from Atlanta to Denver in protest of Georgias new voting laws. MLB joined Georgia-based businesses like Coca-Cola and Delta Air Lines in voicing its opposition to the legislation. Sen. Tim Scott, R-S.C., took a swing at the league and the new game venue, tweeting that Georgia actually offers more days for early voting — 17, compared with Colorados 15 days. The MLB is moving the All Star Game out of Atlanta which has more day-of voting rights than Colorado? Scott tweeted April 6, 2021. Georgia: Voter ID, 17 days of early voting.Colorado: Voter ID, 15 days of early voting.Atlanta is 51% Black.Denver is 9.2% Black.The @MLB is moving the #MLBAllStarGame out of ATL which has more day-of voting rights than CO? The Wokes are at it again, folks. Day-of voting rights refers to access to voting on Election Day, either in person or through dropboxes. On this issue, Scott is off the mark. Colorado allows election day registration, while in Georgia, registration closes about a month earlier. Colorado also makes greater use of dropboxes, keeping them open until the evening on election day for voters to submit their ballots. Under Georgias new law, drop boxes are pulled the Friday before the election. Scotts spokesperson Ken Farnaso said there was a mistype in the tweet, and it should have said more days of voting rights. So we checked the claim on that basis, too, and found that he left out important context in comparing voting in Colorado with Georgia. Georgias new law expanded early voting by one day. The rules already required early voting for three weeks before election day, but only required that local officials include a single Saturday in that period. The new law requires two Saturdays, so Scotts figure of 17 days fits. And the law allows for as many as 19 days. Colorado says that early voting centers must open 15 days before an election. The point of the tweet was to show that Georgia has more days to vote in person than Colorado, contrary to the lefts narrative that it restricts early voting, Farnaso said. But Scotts comparison overlooks that the two states run their elections in very different ways. Colorado relies almost entirely on mail-in ballots. The state sends every registered voter a ballot, and all they have to do is fill it out and put it in the mail in time. Colorado has less of a need to rely on in-person voting than Georgia does because fewer of Colorados voters cast in-person votes, said University of Florida political science professor Michael McDonald. Data from the last general elections in both states show 94% of Colorado voters cast their ballots by mail, while in Georgia, 26% did. As for early voting, 3% of Colorado voters used that option, compared with over half in Georgia. There are no reports of long voting lines in Colorado at the states vote centers, and the state has the second highest turnout rate in the country, McDonald said. Compared to Georgia, there is less evidence of a need for Colorado to provide more voting options. Scott cited the rules for early voting to say that Georgia has more days for in-person voting than Colorado. But the comparison doesnt account for Colorados universal vote-by-mail option. When 94% of voters mail their ballots, early voting days play a nominal role in elections. And in Colorado, voters have more options to register and use dropboxes on election day. Scotts claim has a thread of accuracy, but what it leaves out creates a misleading impression about how voting access compares in the two states.",0.5,0.7,1,0.5,0,0.5,0.5,1,0.5,Half True

Final Rating: True",Medicaid patients were 97 percent more likely to die than those with private insurance.,"Constituents demanding a solution to the Legislatures budget impasse over Medicaid expansion have been emailing Rep. Richard Corcoran, who has been telling voters that the federal program is dangerous for its patients. Several PolitiFact Florida readers have sent in an email response from the Land O Lakes Republican, who is chairman of the House Appropriations Committee and the Joint Legislative Budget Commission. In his reply, Corcoran decries the already high enrollment and expense of Medicaid, the joint state and federal health care program for the very poor, as a reason to not accept federal expansion money under the Affordable Care Act. Unfortunately, those Floridians belong to a troubled delivery system, Corcoran wrote. The largest national study, conducted by the University of Virginia, found that Medicaid patients were 97 percent more likely to die than those with private insurance. Expanding coverage through a health care program that delivers questionable care is not a public policy that Florida should embrace. Saying patients are twice as likely to die is an eye-opening statistic to cite when arguing against Medicaid, implying not only is the program delivering substandard care, its actually bad for patients. We wondered if the federal plan was really to blame for such a high mortality rate. What we found is that if youre on Medicaid and you have surgery, the study Corcoran cited did say you are more likely to die -- but its probably not because youre using Medicaid to pay for treatment. The Virginia study The University of Virginia study was published in 2010, and followed the patient outcomes of almost 900,000 major surgeries across the country. Thats different than the Medicaid population as a whole. It also kept track of whether those patients had private insurance, Medicare, Medicaid or no insurance at all. The eight researchers adjusted for patient health care and population variables like age, income, where they lived, the type of hospital they were in, what kind of operation they were having and more. The results showed Medicaid patients were the most at-risk, and were 1.97 times more likely to die following a procedure than a patient with private insurance. Thats where Corcoran got his percentage, although experts we talked to said it was misleading to use as a reference. Medicaid patients also were more likely to die after a procedure than Medicare patients (1.54 more than insured patients) and even the uninsured (1.74 times). Medicaid recipients also had the highest total costs and longest hospital stays, although mortality rates varied depending on a variety of factors. So does that mean Medicaid is the culprit for the higher odds of patient deaths? Not at all, University of Virginia School of Medicine professor and cardiovascular surgeon Dr. Irving Kron (rhymes with phone) told us. Kron was one of the researchers for the study. While it does adjust for socioeconomic factors, the study notes that if youre on Medicaid, youre probably suffering from a whole host of risk factors other categories of patients dont have, he said. Medicaid recipients are the poorest, least educated and sickest of all patients, and often dont seek medical help until conditions are at their worst. Those patients have the highest incidence of AIDS, depression, liver disease, neurologic disorders, psychoses and metastatic cancer, the study said. The reality is its apples and oranges, Kron said. The problem with Medicaid is theres more emergencies, because theyre sicker than most people.  They wait for care and unfortunately, emergent patients dont do as well as elective patients. Kron said the study focused on whether socioeconomic status was a factor in medical treatment, which it clearly was, and not on the quality of the systems paying for health care. Corcoran insisted the study proved him right. My point was that Medicaid is a subpar health care delivery system, Corcoran said via email. The University of Virginia study supports that conclusion. The study does include a caveat that there is a possible system bias that gives privately insured people access to better hospitals and doctors. For many surgical patients, private insurance status often allows for referral to expert surgeons for their disease. Alternatively, Medicaid and uninsured patients may have been referred to less skilled and less specialized surgeons, the study said. But Kron and health policy experts disagree with Corcorans takeaway. Leighton Ku, director of the Center for Health Policy Research for the Milken Institute School of Public Health at George Washington University, said Medicaid patients are a very broad category that is tough to compare to others, even the uninsured. Echoing Krons concerns, he added that uninsured patients may elect to go without coverage and end up on Medicaid when they become sick, or that insured patients in the study may have reached lifetime policy limits and had to resort to Medicaid. As the researchers in the paper acknowledge, part of the reason that Medicaid is associated with higher mortality is that many people fall into Medicaid when they are very sick and impoverished, Ku said. Other reports Corcoran also directed us to a recent Oregon study that examined the difference between patients allowed to join expanded Medicaid rolls in a 2008 lottery versus others who did not get into the program. Over two years, the study found that while patients in the program initially reported feeling better, there was no real change in health indicators such as diabetes control, cholesterol or blood pressure. In essence, the research found Medicaid didnt really improve physiological health, although patients said they felt better. Thats probably because they didnt have to worry as much about getting treatment, Harvard health economist Ben Sommers said. People in the Oregon study did report better access to care and improvements in mental health. One thing it didnt say, which Corcoran originally argued with the Virginia study, was that Medicaid hurt its patients. In any accounting, there is no evidence of people being worse off for having gotten Medicaid. Getting Medicaid is a major improvement over being uninsured in these studies, Sommers said. Sommers, who is a part-time adviser to the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services, helped research a report on the effects of Medicaid expansion programs in Arizona, Maine and New York. The team found patients in those states showed improved access to care, self-reported health and reduced mortality, compared to nearby states that didnt expand Medicaid. Improvements were higher in minority and very low-income patients. He added that there are other reports that compare different primary payer categories to each other, but there was no evidence of what Corcoran implied in his email -- that Medicaid itself was to blame for the higher mortality rate by providing substandard care. To my knowledge there are no studies that examine the impact of states expanding Medicaid, or individuals going from uninsured to Medicaid, showing Medicaid to be harmful, Sommers said. Our ruling Corcoran said, Medicaid patients were 97 percent more likely to die than those with private insurance. Corcoran was citing a 2010 University of Virginia study that looked at Medicaid patients who underwent surgery, not all people in the program. Experts we spoke to --including one of the studys authors --said its a misleading statistic to cite. While its accurate to say Medicaid patients who undergo operations havehigher odds of dyingthan those with private insurance, its because they are sicker and tend to wait until the last minute for care, not because the program is inadequate. Other studies show using Medicaid improves access and quality of life for many patients, or at the very least doesnt hurt them.",1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,True

Final Rating: Mostly False  ",Says Joe Biden tried to cut Social Security and Medicare for decades.  Now Bidens promising your benefits to illegal immigrants.,"An ad seeking to sway Florida voters to President Donald Trumps side claims that Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden has long attempted to take away benefits from Americans and now wants to give them to immigrants illegally in the country. The ads claims are inaccurate and misleading. Joe Biden tried to cut Social Security and Medicare for decades. ... Now, Biden is promising your benefits to illegal immigrants, says the narrator in the ad posted by Trump for Florida, an official Facebook page for Trump's reelection campaign. Heres an overview of the inaccurate elements in the 30-second video posted Sept. 16. This is not a complete reflection of Bidens record, which has changed over time. Starting in the 1970s, Biden called for an increase in monthly benefits, then for a one-year freeze, then floated raising the retirement age, then backed a change in how benefits would increase, and now calls for higher monthly checks for the oldest beneficiaries. In the 1980s and 1990s, Biden spoke in favor of freezes to Social Security as part of an effort to rein in all spending to reduce the deficit. In a 1995 speech, Biden said: When I argued that we should freeze federal spending, I meant Social Security as well. I meant Medicare and Medicaid. I meant veterans benefits. I meant every single solitary thing in the government. And I not only tried it once. I tried it twice. I tried it a third time, and I tried it a fourth time. The Trump ad features a clip of that 1995 speech, but it cut out the part where Biden said he meant freezing every single solitary thing in the government. Bidens campaign told PolitiFact that throughout his career in Congress, Biden cast nearly 50 votes to increase Social Security benefits or block Republican plans to curtail benefits. As vice president during the Obama administration, Biden generally focused on protecting Social Security, and resisted moves to privatize Social Security. However, the administration in 2014, proposed changing how Social Security cost-of-living increases were calculated. The method, which the left-leaning Center for Budget and Policy Priorities found would have reduced benefits by 1% to 2% over the course of the average retirement, received push-back and was later dropped. Biden as a presidential candidate says action is urgently needed to make the program solvent and prevent cuts to American retirees. The Trump ad cites as evidence for its claim a Jan. 13 article from The Intercept, headlined, Fact Check: Joe Biden Has Advocated Cutting Social Security for 40 Years. The story said that Bidens 2020 position to increase Social Security benefits is at odds with decades of his own advocacy. It cited his stance in the 1980s and 1990s among evidence of his interest in practicing fiscal restraint. During the Democratic presidential primary, Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., similarly claimed that Biden has advocated cutting Social Security for 40 years. This is not Bidens promise. There is no evidence Biden seeks to deprive Americans of their Social Security and Medicare benefits and give them to immigrants who are violating immigration laws. Bidens plans related to health care and seniors do not call for the elimination of Social Security benefits or Medicare for Americans. And Biden has not put forward a policy to entitle immigrants illegally in the country to Social Security benefits, or to give them access to Medicare, his campaign said. Biden favors allowing immigrants illegally in the country to buy health care plans under the Affordable Care Act marketplace, but without financial help from the government. This would not invalidate U.S. citizens and lawful permanent residents ability to also buy health care plans in the exchange. The Trump ad cited May 10, 2019, Fox News reporting. That day, Fox News said Biden supported health care for immigrants illegally in the country. The story said that in response to a question on whether immigrants illegally in the country should should be entitled to federal benefits like Medicare or Medicaid, Biden said: Look, I think that anyone who is in a situation where they are in need of health care, regardless of whether they are documented or undocumented, we have an obligation to see that they are cared for. Video of that response doesnt show Biden explicitly mentioning Medicare or Medicaid. Trump in July falsely claimed that under Bidens policy, immigrants in the country illegally get welfare benefits. United States citizens don't get what they're looking to give illegal immigrants. Trumps campaign did not respond to our queries, and neither did the White House. But a Trump campaign official told the Washington Posts Fact Checker that Biden supported Obama-era programs that defer deportation for immigrants and make them eligible for Social Security. As the Washington Post pointed out, people receive Social Security benefits if they pay into the system, and immigrants wouldnt be taking away your benefits, as the ad implied. A Trump campaign ad claimed, Joe Biden tried to cut Social Security and Medicare for decades. ... Now Bidens promising your benefits to illegal immigrants. Its misleading to say that Biden for decades tried to cut Social Security and Medicare. His overall record is mixed. The ad also gives the wrong impression that Biden is trying to take benefits away from Americans and grant them to immigrants illegally in the country. Thats not Bidens plan. Biden wants to allow immigrants illegally in the country to buy health insurance, without subsidies. That would not take away Ameicans ability to buy their own insurance.

Final Rating: False  ",Italy has decided not to treat their elderly for this virus.,"In Italy, beset by more cases of COVID-19 than any country but China, hospitals have been forced to make tough triage decisions and ration treatment. But that doesnt mean the country decided to stop treating elderly coronavirus patients. A post on Facebook made that claim on March 14, 2020. Italy has decided not to treat their elderly for this virus. That, my friends, is socialized healthcare, the post claimed. It was flagged as part of Facebooks efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) On the day of the post, Italy had recorded 17,660 cases of coronavirus and 1,268 deaths, according to the World Health Organization. The number of deaths represented 58% of the 2,199 coronavirus deaths outside China, including 41 deaths in the United States. By that point, Italys hospitals were faced with choosing which of the sickest patients should be treated, and priorities tended to exclude the elderly, who experts say are among the most vulnerable to COVID-19. Triage is a common tool used in health care systems. For example, the U.S. Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality promotes an algorithm for emergency department triage that divides patients into five groups — most urgent to least urgent, on the basis of acuity and resource needs. But with the exceptional situation presented by the coronavirus in Italy, special guidelines were developed for Italian health care professionals dealing with COVID-19. By mid March, news organizations had already reported on how Italian doctors were being forced to choose which patients to treat — with the elderly getting a lower priority. There are now simply too many patients for each one of them to receive adequate care, The Atlantic reported. Doctors and nurses are unable to tend to everybody. They lack machines to ventilate all those gasping for air. The Atlantic also reported that COVID-19 guidelines that had been established by medical doctors from the Italian College of Anesthesia, Analgesia, Resuscitation and Intensive Care: Informed by the principle of maximizing benefits for the largest number, the guidelines suggest that the allocation criteria need to guarantee that those patients with the highest chance of therapeutic success will retain access to intensive care. ... It may become necessary to establish an age limit for access to intensive care. The New York Times, reporting from Rome, quoted Dr. Flavia Petrini, president of the college, as saying: No one is getting kicked out, but were offering criteria of priority. These choices are made in normal times, but whats not normal is when you have to assist 600 people all at once. The Times also reported that Giorgo Gori, mayor of Bergamo, in Lombardy, Italys worst affected region, said that in some cases, the gap between resources and the enormous influx of patients forced the doctors to decide not to intubate some very old patients, essentially leaving them to die. Were there more intensive care units, he added, it would have been possible to save more lives. As of March 17, 2020, the latest World Health Organization update showed Italy with 27,980 cases and 2,503 deaths. That was second to China, which had 81,116 and 3,231. The United States had 3,503 and 58. A Facebook post claiming Italy had decided to stop treating elderly COVID-19 patients goes too far. Overwhelmed by the number of cases, the country was relying on guidelines to give priority for some treatments, such as ventilators, to those patients most likely to survive.",0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,False

Final Rating: Mostly False  ",Wendy Davis has already taken more $ from teacher unions than the past 3 Democrat gubernatorial candidates combined.,"Teacher groups often back Democrats for office; it shouldnt be a surprise Wendy Davis has such support. Still, a reader asked us to check an April 11, 2014, tweet from @WendyDavisTruth, a Twitter account run by the Republican Party of Texas. The tweet said, Wendy Davis has already taken more $ from teacher unions than the past 3 Democrat gubernatorial candidates combined. The tweet came with a bar chart comparing contributions by three teacher groups — the Texas State Teachers Association, Texas chapter of the American Federation of Teachers and the political arm of the Texas Classroom Teachers Association. The bar labeled 2014 Wendy Davis far exceeded comparable bars for Tony Sanchezs 2002 gubernatorial run, Chris Bells 2006 campaign and Bill Whites 2010 campaign. Heres the chart:  By the groups math, Davis has drawn $102,777 from the three teacher groups, while the previous three Democratic nominees for governor combined to attract $102,700. Republican Party of Texa administrator Beth Cubriel told us by email the figures were based on contribution and expenditure reports filed at the Texas Ethics Commission. She added that the figures reflect all contributions by the teacher groups to the candidates — not just contributions made while each one was running for governor. But labels on the chart — 2006 Bell and 2014 Wendy Davis, for example — left us with a different impression. One might not expect that previous campaigns for other offices would be included in those contribution totals. We looked next at how much each candidate drew from the singled-out groups while running for governor. By our calculations, Davis garnered about $67,000 of her contributions from the groups for her two tightly-contested Senate campaigns with about $36,000 coming in since she declared for governor Oct. 3, 2013. Likewise, Bell in 2006 drew no donations from the groups during his run for governor; his nearly $40,000 came during his 2008 campaign for a Texas Senate seat. By contrast, the teacher contributions to Sanchez in 2002 and White in 2010 were specifically for gubernatorial campaigns. By email, Cubriel said our breakdown succinctly covers what didn't fit into the four corners of the party's chart. The party never claimed the money was given to her gov(ernor) campaign directly, she said. The years on the chart are to serve as a reminder of when each candidate was the nominee. We told Cubriel that our review of campaign-finance reports turned up a sizable contribution not included in the partys critique--$125,000 gained by Daviss gubernatorial kitty on Jan. 15, 2014, from the Washington, D.C.-based American Federation of Teachers Committee on Political Education. Cubriel said by phone that party researchers didnt search records for that group. That makes the case against her even worse, she said. Our ruling The Texas party said Davis has already taken more money from teacher unions, meaning three teacher groups, than the previous three Democratic gubernatorial candidates combined and presented a chart purporting to show that. The tweet and chart turned out to mislead. Most of the cited teacher groups giving to Davis came during her campaigns for state Senate, not during her run for governor. Running for governor, Davis has attracted about $36,000 from two of the groups and nothing from the third. That total trails the $65,000 combined raised by two of the previous nominees in their respective gubernatorial bids. Regardless, the claim has an element of truth.

Final Rating: Mostly False  ","Ron Johnson is trying to let insurance companies deny coverage to people with pre-existing conditions like cancer, depression, pregnancy, diabetes—or even COVID.","Its no secret that U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson isnt a fan of the Affordable Care Act, the Obama administrations signature health care law, passed in 2010. A hallmark of the law was its rule that health insurance companies cant refuse to cover people or charge them more if they have a pre-existing condition — a health problem they had before the insurance coverage started. Wisconsin State Treasurer Sarah Godlewski, a Democrat whos vying to unseat Johnson this fall, targeted Johnson this way in a April 1tweet: Ron Johnson is trying to let insurance companies deny coverage to people with pre-existing conditions like cancer, depression, pregnancy, diabetes — or even COVID. That coverage, of course, is a key provision in the Affordable Care Act. But does that mean Godlewski is right? When asked to provide evidence of her claim, Godlewskis office sent a list of votes Johnson has cast in favor of repealing or scaling back the health care law. Soon after he took office, Johnson cosponsored a bill to repeal the Affordable Care Act, saying in a Jan. 26, 2011, news release that it was the single greatest assault on our freedom in my lifetime. He voted multiple times to drop the laws individual mandate, which required most people to have health insurance or pay a penalty, and voted for a series of attempted repeals during the summer of 2017. But just because he wanted to get rid of the law doesnt necessarily mean he wanted people with pre-existing conditions to go without protections. After all, many Republicans have said they support that provision, and it is widely popular with voters. Godlewskis strongest evidence stems from a vote Johnson cast for the Better Care Reconciliation Act, an amendment to the GOP plan to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act. The final version of the amendment — which failed — would have allowed insurance companies to offer plans that could deny coverage to sick people as long as they carried at least one comprehensive plan that followed the Affordable Care Acts rules. Insurance companies and patient groups decried the amendment, saying it would make those comprehensive plans more costly and create two systems of insurance, one for healthy and one for sick people. In that specific instance, then, Johnson did vote for legislation that could have allowed insurance companies to have plans that denied people with pre-existing conditions coverage. But — to get technical — all of those companies would also have had to have at least one plan that did cover people with pre-existing conditions, even if it was likely to end up being expensive. Johnsons office said the senator has committed to protections for people with pre-existing conditions. They pointed to his introduction of the Protect Act in February 2021, which would prohibit health insurers from imposing exclusions on plans based on pre-existing conditions. (The bill has not moved from committee.) They also cited a response Johnson gave to a Milwaukee Journal Sentinel inquiry about his views on health care on March 17: The first step in any health care reform would assure everyone that people with preexisting conditions would be protected by having their insurance rates subsidized so that they pay the same rates as those without preexisting conditions. In a June 26, 2017, New York Times opinion piece criticizing the Republican alternative to the Affordable Care Act, Johnson wrote that he was in part dissatisfied with the bill because it leaves in place the pre-existing condition rules that drive up the cost of insurance for everyone. But he followed that by writing that the country should look to improve successful models for protecting individuals with pre-existing conditions, models underway prior to Obamacare. His statements are just that — statements. Skeptics may question whether the views are sincere, or if political roadblocks would prevent it from happening. But given current facts as theyre known, Godlewskis claim doesnt quite hold up. Godlewski claimed Johnson is trying to let insurance companies deny coverage to people with pre-existing conditions. The senator did cast a vote in 2017 that would have opened the door for insurance companies to offer such plans, but still would have required them to offer other plans that did provide that coverage. And hes said consistently that he aims to protect coverage for people with pre-existing conditions. Our definition of Mostly False is a statement that contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.

Final Rating: Mostly False",Says the late Lady Bird Johnson sicced the CIA on actress and singer Eartha Kitt after Kitt spoke out against the Vietnam War during a White House luncheon in January 1968.,"During an episode of Comedy Centrals Drunk History, comedian Nicole Byer described a conflict between the late Lady Bird Johnson and actress and singer Eartha Kitt when Johnson was first lady. During a July 2 episode, Byer said: Lady Bird calls the CIA and she goes, 'Yo listen, this b----? I don't like this b----. You better find everything you can about her so I can send it to other people so she doesn't work. Lady Bird is just like, Destroy her,  Byer said. We had to know whether Byers description of Texas icon Lady Bird Johnson was accurate. Comedy Central did not return a request for more information, so we consulted archival news coverage and spoke with historians to check this claim. Kitt was one of 50 women invited to the White House on Jan. 18, 1968, for a Women Doer's Luncheon to discuss crime among young people, according to a Jan. 19, 1968, New York Times story. Johnson frequently recorded her thoughts and reflections throughout her husband Lyndon Johnsons presidency, according to the LBJ Presidential Library and Museum. A transcript from a Jan. 18, 1968, recording details the day of the luncheon. Other women in attendance included governors wives, senators wives, journalists, and members of the National Emergency Committee on the National Council on Crime and Delinquency, according to Johnsons audio diary. Both President Lyndon Johnson and the first lady were at the luncheon. When Kitt rose to speak, she offered a sharp condemnation of the Vietnam War, according to the New York Times story. In her audio diary, Lady Bird Johnson said that Kitt took a step toward her, looking with intense directness at me, when she offered her critique. You send the best of this country off to be shot and maimed, Kitt said during the luncheon, according to the Times. They rebel in the street. They will take pot and they will get high. They dont want to go to school because theyre going to be snatched off from their mothers to be shot in Vietnam. Johnson said Kitts speech stunned the room into silence. Kitt wasn't the only entertainment icon to criticize the Johnson administration over the Vietnam War. Michael Gillette, a former historian at the LBJ Presidential Library, said journalist Walter Cronkite and actress Jane Fonda were among the public figures who spoke out against the war. Kitts comments were well documented in the press, as they caused quite a commotion. An anonymous letter to the first lady on Jan. 22, 1968, included racist language about Kitt and said she defiled the White House and made us all ashamed. A woman named Clarence Nowack left a message for Johnson on Jan. 20, 1968, to say she was proud of her son for volunteering to serve in the war, where he was killed. Warren E. Burger, then a federal appellate judge who would be named a year later to the U.S. Supreme Court, said in a Jan. 19, 1968, letter to Johnson that he and his wife were proud of how she composed herself during the luncheon. The unhappy episode at your recent luncheon impells me to write you to say that Mrs. Burger and I took a deep pride in the courage and composure you exhibited in the face of a gross breach of your hospitality and of good elementary manners, Burger said. A letter to the editor published on Jan. 27, 1968, in the Times said in part: There are even a few of us who believe that it is not really decent, or fair, to attack a man by insulting and humiliating his wife in the presence of other guests and the press. Kitt told the Times, according to a Jan. 23, 1968, article, that she had received telegrams, phone calls and mail from supporters who agreed with what she had said. Kitt later said in a June 7, 2006, video interview that she had not realized that the debacle at the White House affected her career until investigative reporter Seymour Hersh called her about the CIAs file on her. I didnt realize I was being rejected in the United States and I couldnt find work. I thought maybe my popularity is waning, my records sales are not up, Kitt said. Byer said Johnson asked the CIA to find damaging information on Kitt after the luncheon. We couldnt find evidence of this direct request. But the Secret Service did request information about Kitt from the CIA the day after the womens luncheon, according to Hersh's Jan. 3, 1975, story in the Times. Historians say it is unclear who directed the Secret Service to make the request. Secret Service officials said they asked the CIA for information on Kitt to see if she was a threat to President Johnson or others under their protection, according to the Times. The CIA gave a three-page report on Kitt to the Secret Service, a file the agency had maintained since at least 1956, because Kitt had done work overseas, the Times reported. The report stated that Kitt had a very nasty disposition and described her as being a spoiled child, very crude and having a vile tongue. We submitted an open records request to the CIA seeking the information in the report. The CIA responded: we did not locate any responsive records that would reveal a publicly acknowledged CIA affiliation with the subject. John Wilson, an archivist at the LBJ Presidential Library, said he doubts Lady Bird Johnson would have asked the CIA to investigate the star, and if she did, she would not have put it in writing. As far as actual power, first ladies dont have very much, but people would tend to listen, I would think, Wilson said. Whether or not she should or could ask is one thing, but if she did ask them informally, they would be a lot more likely to pay attention. Gillette said that Johnson would not have wanted to fan the flames around the Kitt incident. I knew her a long time and I knew a lot of people who knew her better than I did, and thats so out of character for her that its almost laughable, Gillette said. Drunk History claimed former first lady Lady Bird Johnson demanded the CIA find damning information on singer Eartha Kitt. While the Secret Service did request information from the CIA following the luncheon, there is no evidence to support the idea that Lady Bird Johnson asked for the information. The Secret Service said the request was made for security purposes, not to destroy her.

Final Rating: Half True  ","Fifty-two counties have average taxes of above the SALT $10,000 cap.","Gov. Andrew Cuomos complaints about a provision in the 2017 federal tax law haveintensified in recent months. The provision caps the federal deduction for state and local tax payments at $10,000. As governor of the state of New York today, my top priority is repealing SALT. Period, Cuomo told reporters in March, referring to the cap on state and local tax deductions in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. The effect of the $10,000 cap on SALT deductions is widespread in New York, Cuomo said.  Fifty-two counties have average taxes of above the SALT $10,000 cap, Cuomo said at his March news conference. Fifty-two counties will see a tax increase. We wondered if his rhetoric around the issue is accurate. Is the problem with the cap as widespread as he said? Do 52 counties have average state and local taxesabove the $10,000 cap? Cuomo has repeated this claim several times, and a report from the Office of the State Comptroller appears to be his source. In October 2017, while changes to the tax law were under discussion but before they were passed, Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli released a report on how the changes could affect New York. One of the proposals DiNapolis office analyzed was the proposal in Washington to eliminate or reduce the federal deduction for state and local taxes. This is a big deal for our state: New Yorkers reported more than $72 billion in deductions for income and property taxes in 2015, DiNapoli wrote. Of that total, income taxes accounted for $51.7 billion and property taxes for $20.9 billion.  The Office of Comptroller found that filers who claimed state and local tax deductions had an average deduction of more than $10,000 in 52 of New Yorks 62 counties, according to its analysis of county-by-county data from the Internal Revenue Services Statistics of Income program from the 2015 tax year. The most recent IRS data, released from the 2016 tax year, showed average deductions above $10,000 in 53 counties. We asked some tax experts about Cuomos claim. Several noted that many tax filers do not itemize their deductions, and that Cuomos claim about average taxes above the cap fails to convey this point. Only 34.8 percent of New Yorkers took the state and local tax deduction in 2016; the governor is claiming that average taxes in these counties are over $10,000 based on the taxes of a little over one-third of the population -- generally speaking, the wealthiest one-third, said Jared Walczak, a senior policy analyst at the nonpartisan Tax Foundation. Walczak found that the average state and local taxes across all filers was above $10,000 in only three counties: Westchester, New York and Nassau. Even if its not relevant for SALT deduction purposes, filers who dont itemize have state and local tax liabilities, too, so the average would be over $10,000 in a handful of other counties, such as Putnam, Rockland and Suffolk counties, Walczak said. Tax experts also noted that averages can be skewed by a few very high earners. To put this in context: 81.5 percent of New York filers have an adjusted gross income of $100,000 or less, and they pay an average of $2,840 in federal income taxes. Yet the average federal income tax liability for a New York filer is $13,896, skewed upward by the highest earners, Walczak said. Similarly, the vast majority of New York filers are well below the SALT deduction cap, and in many cases aren't deducting state and local taxes at all.  If Cuomos implication is that taxes will go up because of the cap on SALT, of course, most of those people still get a tax cut because of TCJA, said Steve Wamhoff, director of federal tax policy at the left-leaning Institute of Taxation and Economic Policy. We asked the governors office about the issues with his claim that 52 counties have average state and local taxesabove $10,000. The facts remain the same: The federal government values the cap on SALT deductions at more than $600 billion over the next decade; and New Yorkers will pay $15 billion more to the federal government annually, taking more from New York than any other State, said Freeman Klopott, spokesman for the Division of Budget. The bottom line is this is a tax increase for our state to benefit the federal government that unfairly attacks New York, which is already the top contributor to the federal government. PolitiFact New York has fact-checked a claim that New York gives more to the federal treasury than the state gets back, and found it to be True. In making a case to repeal the $10,000 cap on state and local tax deductions, Cuomo said that in 52 counties the average amount of state and local taxes exceeded the cap. The latest data available, from 2016, before the new tax law was implemented, show that in 53 counties, the average state and local tax deduction was greater than $10,000, when the average is calculated using returns from filers who claimed that deduction -- not from every filer. He bases his statement on the taxes paid by about one-third of the population,generally the more affluentone-third. Cuomo's statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression about how severe the cap is for most New Yorkers. He makes it seem the cap's effect ismore widespread than it is.",0.5,0.5,1.0,0.5,0.0,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,Half True

Final Rating: Mostly False",We have a higher deficit with China now than we did before.,"During the first presidential debate, Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden went after President Donald Trump over trade with China, an issue Trump often uses against Biden. You take a look at what he's actually done, he's done very little, Biden said. His trade deals are the same way. He talks about these great trade deals. You know, he talks about The Art of the Deal, China has perfected the art of the steal. We have a higher deficit with China now than we did before. In reality, the U.S. deficit with China in goods and services, the most inclusive trade measurement, was smaller under Trump in 2019, the most recent full year, than it was in any of the final three years of the Obama administration, in which Biden served as vice president. Heres the year-by-year data from the federal Bureau of Economic Analysis:  While the trade deficit in goods and services with China improved under Trump between 2018 and 2019, its still large in an absolute sense. The U.S. bought in excess of $300 billion more in goods and services from China in 2019 than China did from the U.S. Bidens campaign pointed to a more limited figure — trade in goods only — which shows that the trade deficit with China has generally been higher under Trump than it was under Obama. But even here, the U.S. made progress under Trump in 2019 in whittling down the goods deficit. The goods deficit was $375 billion in 2017, $418 billion in 2018, and $345 billion in 2019. The 2019 figure was similar to the level it was in 2016, the final year of the Obama administration. Biden said, We have a higher deficit with China now than we did before. The most inclusive measurement, for goods and services, shows that the U.S. trade deficit with China was smaller under Trump in 2019, the most recent full year, than it was in any of the final three years of the Obama administration. Looking only at goods shows the trade deficit was generally higher under Trumpthan it was in the Obama years, but it declined in 2019 to around the level as the final year of the Obama administration.",0,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,Mostly False

Final Rating: False  ",President Barack Obama has the power to stop deportation for all undocumented immigrants in this country.,"Even a presidential heckler can find his way to PolitiFacts Truth-O-Meter. At a speech Monday in San Francisco, a young man yelled at President Barack Obama and urged the president to overhaul the nations immigration system. Mr. Obama, my family has been separated for 19 months now! the man said, according to a New York Times report. (You can watch a video of the incident here.) Obama continued trying to speak, but the man continued yelling, saying at one point: You have a power to stop deportation for all undocumented immigrants in this country. The heckler was later identified as Ju Hong, 24, of South Korea. The president replied, Actually, I dont. And thats why were here. In this standoff, the president is largely correct. We covered much of this ground in a fact-check of Florida U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio, who claimed that Obama could basically legalize all immigrants here illegally by the sign of a pen. Well review the evidence here. In the hecklers case, he appears to be talking about Obama issuing an executive order to stop deportations. But experts said action like that would likely violate the separation of powers. Congress determines the laws governing how a person can legally reside in the country, so Obama cannot give out green cards, paths to citizenship or permanent residency en masse, experts told us. And Obama does not have the authority to override laws simply by proclamation. Executive orders have tended to be quite focused, not open-ended over time, said Kevin Johnson, University of California Davis School of Law dean. Such an order would likely be subject to quite possibly successful legal challenge, with the claim being that legalization would be contrary to an act of Congress, namely the Immigration and Nationality Act. Now, Obama has taken some executive action. In June 2012, amid stalled DREAM Act efforts, Obama announced a new administrative policy called Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals that allowed undocumented immigrants who came to the country as children to apply for a renewable, temporary status that suspends deportation and allows them to work in the country. So far, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services has approved at least 455,000 people for this form of deferred action. Obama, however, has said he does not plan to go further. And experts say making the case would be difficult. If he wanted to order a stay of deportations across the board, he would have to provide a strong justification, such as a lack of resources to do the job, said Robert Delahunty, a University of St. Thomas School of Law professor who co-authored an argument against the constitutionality of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals. But he could do that only briefly, and only in what Id consider pretty extreme circumstances, Delahunty said. On the other hand, the countrys immigration laws grant Obama and the Department of Homeland Security lots of wiggle room in granting temporary work permits and refusing to widely deport people, said Alex Nowrasteh, an immigration policy analyst at the libertarian Cato Institute. A widespread stay, though, would be a crazy scenario, he said. Even some of Obamas loudest critics on immigration policy dont think he would go that far. It could be done. Obamas gotten away with as much, but I dont think hed do it, said Mark Krikorian, executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies, a think tank that is for stricter immigration control. That would be a bridge too far even for the pusillanimous appeasers among Republicans in Congress. Experts told us they think its more conceivable that Obama would chip away at the undocumented immigrant population little by little by building on the deferred action policy for children who came to the country as minors. An expansion would have to come with caveats, such as cut-off dates and clean criminal histories. It would be the mother of all political battles, said Carl Hampe, a private immigration lawyer who was counsel for the Senate subcommittee on immigration from 1983 to 1991 and worked for the Department of Justice under President George H.W. Bush. As a purely theoretical legal question, is there a plausible argument that the president has that legal authority? Some would argue yes. Our ruling While giving a speech in San Francisco, President Barack Obama was heckled and told he has the power to stop deportation for all undocumented immigrants in this country. Our experts say any executive action that sweeping would violate the separation of powers between Congress and the executive branch. Obama has taken some executive action to temporarily keep more undocumented immigrants in the United States, and likely could do more, but not to the permanent point that the heckler argues.",0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,False

Final Rating: False  ",Science says that being single will kill you faster than obesity.,"Finding a date can feel like a life or death situation. According to Wonderneed, an clickbait news site, it actually might be. An articlehas the headline, Science says that being single will kill you faster than obesity. Facebook users shared the #relatable content over 9,000 times in less than a week. This story was flagged as part Facebooks efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) We decided to find out if being single was a health risk. The article focuses on a 2017 press release about the 125th Annual Convention of the American Psychological Association. Dr. Julianna Holt-Lunstad, professor of psychology at Brigham Young University, gave a presentation about the public health hazard of loneliness. Her team analyzed 218 studies that examined the connection between social isolation and mortality. In these studies, researchers would track a group of subjects over the course of years. In some studies, participants would report how lonely they felt. In others, their loneliness was measured more objectively, based on the number of social connections an individual had or whether they lived alone. Holt-Lunstad and her team found that lonely people were 50 percent more likely to die during the period of observation than those with good social connections. For comparison, obese individuals have a 45 percent higher risk of death, based on a 2016 Harvard study. So, based on these stats, loneliness is just as much as, if not slightly more, of a health risk than obesity. The Wonderneed article, though, doesnt say loneliness is more dangerous than obesity; it says being single is. Holt-Lunstads study didnt focus on romance. Romantic relationships were included as social connections, she explained to us, but the result wasnt specific to being single. Based solely on her meta-analysis, the article cannot conclude that a lack of romance is the health risk. Phew. The headline also mischaracterizes what these stats mean in practice. It claims that being single will kill you faster than obesity. The mere act of being single is not killing anyone. It is the loneliness associated with being single that might carry the risk. Second, none of these studies mention the element of time. Researchers measured the number of isolated people who died over the course of the study and compared it to the number of well-connected people who died. Because significantly more isolated people passed away, they concluded that loneliness was a health risk. The same method would be used to measure the risk of obesity: If 15 percent of the obese sample died, and only 3 percent of the non-obese sample did, researchers would know that obesity was a health risk. It is misleading to say that one would kill faster than the other. While the Wonderneed claim is incorrect, were sure youre wondering: Are single people at a higher risk for death than those who are married? Other research has taken on the question of romance and health more directly. A study from 2011 showed that single people had a 24 percent increased risk for mortality. Especially within younger, healthier age groups, a single person is significantly more likely to die than someone married. Researchers found that, among 30-somethings, being single increased health risks by 128 percent. Its unclear why this phenomenon exists. It could be because risk-takers are less likely to marry, and more likely to do stupid nonsense (emphasis ours). Or, unmarried people may have less access to health care and resources that married couples have. Perhaps, seriously ill people are getting married less often than healthy people, so it just seems like singles are more likely to die. Regardless of the underlying reason, though, the statistics paint a dark future for the unlucky-in-love. The health risks for being single are lower than those of being lonely or obese, but still significant. The article by Wonderneed claimed that science says being single will kill you faster than obesity. But the article cites an analysis on loneliness, not on romantic relationships. Studies have shown that loneliness can be a significant health concern, increasing a persons risk of death by 50 percent. This is a higher rate than that of obesity, which increases health risks by 45 percent. But none of the studies actually examine the speed at which someone dies.",0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,False

Final Rating: Mostly False  ","Says Al Jazeera, a mouthpiece for terrorists, has been paying Jon Ossoff thousands of dollars. ... What is he hiding?","No Democrat has held Georgias 6th Congressional District since 1979. Now, in a race to replace Republican Tom Price who joined the administration as secretary of Health and Human Services, 30-year-old Democrat Jon Ossoff stands out. In a field packed with 16 candidates from both parties, the latest poll shows Ossoff with about 40 percent. He needs to break 50 percent on Election Day, April 18, to avoid a runoff. Republican groups and their allies aim to block that. The Congressional Leadership Fund, a super PAC aligned with House Speaker Paul Ryan, posted a web video that ties Ossoff to Al Jazeera, the Qatar-based news organization. The ad opens with shots of Islamic fighters followed by a grainy television snippet of Osama bin Laden talking. The voiceover says: Al Jazeera, a media outlet that has been described as a mouthpiece for terrorists, has been paying Jon Ossoff thousands of dollars. But Jon refuses to tell voters exactly how much money hes received. Just like Jon refuses to tell voters the truth about his experience. What is he hiding? The focus of this fact-check is on the ads statement, combined with the imagery that accompanies the claim, that Al Jazeera, a mouthpiece for terrorists, has been paying Jon Ossoff thousands of dollars. A mouthpiece for terrorists? The ad cites an article from the American Journalism Review to back up its description of Al Jazeera. The article, entitled The Al Jazeera Effect, centered on the news organizations strategy of getting on-the-ground camera footage and reporting in the early days of the Arab Spring protests. The article relays a variety of opinions that have been offered about Al Jazeera. The ad chose one from this passage: For years, critics have assailed what they see as anti-Semitic, anti-American bias in the channel's news content. In the wake of 9/11, Al Jazeera broadcast statements by Osama bin Laden and reported from within the ranks of the Taliban, earning a reputation as a mouthpiece for terrorists. But the article also quotes David Marash, a former Nightline correspondent who joined and then left Al Jazeera over concerns about anti-American bias. Despite that history, the article said Marash described Al Jazeera as the best news channel on earth.... Al Jazeera has become the model all around the world. Video reporting from the field sets them apart and makes them the best. Congressional Leadership Fund spokeswoman Courtney Alexander offered several other examples of criticism of Al Jazeera. A 2001 New York Times Magazine article said day in and day out, Al Jazeera deliberately fans the flames of Muslim outrage. A 2013 USA Today article quoted an Israeli center analyst who said Al Jazeeras Arab language broadcasts very often promote a very radical Islamist approach. Alexander also pointed to reports that the news network is backed by the Qatari government, and Qatar has been linked to financing terrorist groups. On the other hand, in 2011, Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., described Al Jazeera in glowing terms for its work during the Arab Spring. Im very proud of the role that Al Jazeera has played, McCain said. I congratulate you and I mourn for those who have sacrificed in the service of providing the information, which is knowledge, which is power. The point is, some people have a bad opinion of Al Jazeera and others think its done good work. The ad cherry-picked images and a quote that cast Al Jazeera in the most dubious light possible. That characterization was the basis for the rest of the ad. Al Jazeera payments to Ossoff The video said Al Jazeera has been paying Ossoff thousands of dollars. Its source is an article from the conservative website the Washington Free Beacon, based on Ossoffs congressional financial disclosure form. The report covered all of 2016 and nearly three months in 2017, and in it, Ossoff includes Al Jazeera as one client out of 13 that paid his firm Insight TWI at least $5,000. Insight TWI is a British-based documentary film production company. Ossoff became its CEO in 2013. Heres the key section from his disclosure:  The Washington Free Beacon asked Ossoff to go beyond the federal requirements and say how much he received from Al Jazeera. He didnt respond. As a technical matter, according to the experts we reached,the Al Jazeera payments went to the firm, not Ossoff as the video said. He was CEO and shared in the proceeds, but all we know is that Al Jazeera paid Insight TWI at least $5,000. In a statement, Ossoffs campaign said his firms clients include broadcasters in Britain, the Netherlands, Denmark and Sweden. Under Jons leadership, the companys investigations have resulted in the arrest of foreign officials stealing U.S.-taxpayer-funded aid and quack doctors who mutilate women, as well as exposed atrocities committed by ISIS in Iraq, including sexual slavery, the statement said. According to the Insight TWI website, the company produced 10 film projects since Ossoff took the helm. Of those, nine were for Al Jazeera. During the time period covered by Ossoffs financial disclosure, 2016 and 2017, there is only one film project reported for Al Jazeera. The other was for the BBC. The most recent Al Jazeera project was a six-part series on Latin America. Topics covered included child trafficking and sexual exploitation across the Argentina-Bolivia border, allegations of slave labor in Brazils garment industry and deaths in police custody in Mexico. Over the years, Al Jazeera paid Ossoffs company for investigations that revealed government corruption in Africa, extra-judicial killings, corrupt doctors selling HIV/AIDS drugs on the black market, and related themes. One film dealt with terrorists. It was produced for the BBC and followed a group of Yazidi women turned soldiers who seek revenge on ISIS fighters. Alexander of the Congressional Leadership Fund noted that Ossoff mentions the BBC but not Al Jazeera on his website. Ossoffs resume When Ossoff launched his campaign, he touted his national security background, saying he had five years under his belt as a congressional staffer. We found that was an exaggeration. By our count, he spent about three years in middle-to-senior level foreign policy posts. The ad says Ossoff refuses to tell voters the truth about his experience. On the contrary, the campaign provided a timeline (at the bottom of this link)showing what he did and when. Alexander told us that on the stump, Ossoff doesnt go out of his way to acknowledge his exaggeration. Our ruling The Congressional Leadership Fund video says Al Jazeera, a mouthpiece for terrorists, has been paying Jon Ossoff thousands of dollars and asks what is he hiding? This is a case when a series of partial truths are strung together to promote the worst possible conclusion. Some Americans have called Al Jazeera a mouthpiece of terrorists. Others, including a U.S. senator, have praised it as a beacon of reporting in the Middle East and Africa. The ad cherry-picks its evidence to characterize Al Jazeera only as aligned with terrorists. Al Jazeera did payOssoff's company.During the time frame covered in his financial disclosure, Ossoffs firm produced two film projects, one for Al Jazeera and one for the BBC. Al Jazeera has been a major client over the years, but going back to the start of 2016, it is one out of 13. In addition, the films Al Jazeera have commissioned focus on wrongdoing in Africa and Latin America and have nothing to do with the Middle East or terrorism. The ad suggests Ossoff is hiding something. Given the evidence at hand, the answer appears to be that he is unwilling to open the books of his business beyond what the law requires. The ads description of Al Jazeera strikes us as particularly selective and central to the suspicions the ad raises.",0.5,0.9,1.0,0.6,0.7,0.8,0.7,1.0,0.5,Mostly False

Final Rating: Half True  ","Eighty-five percent of every dollar donated to the Clinton Foundation ended up either with the Clintons or with their staff to pay for travel, salaries, and benefits. Fifteen cents of every dollar actually went to some charitable beneficiary.","Much of the discussion about the Clinton family foundation has focused on who donated to it and what they may have expected in return from then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. But critics of the Clintons have opened up another line of attack on what is formally known as the Bill, Hillary & Chelsea Clinton Foundation, charging that it doesnt actually spend very much on charitable works. Conservative radio host Rush Limbaugh aired this line of argument on April 23, 2015, citing a report in the Federalist, a conservative publication. Heres a portion of what Limbaugh said: The Marine Corps-Law Enforcement Foundation -- 99 percent pass-through. The Clinton Family Foundation pass-through is 15 percent. The Federalist reports only 15 percent of the money donated to the Clinton Family Foundation went to actual charitable causes. The bulk of the money donated to the Clinton Family Foundation went to travel, salaries, and benefits. Sixty percent of all the money raised went to other expenses. In other words, folks, 85 percent of every dollar donated to the Clinton Foundation ended up either with the Clintons or with their staff to pay for travel, salaries, and benefits. Fifteen cents of every dollar actually went to some charitable beneficiary. As this claim was circulating, the Clinton Foundation pushed back. The foundation tweeted, More than 88% of our expenditures go directly to our life-changing work. The difference between 15 percent and 88 percent is wide, so we decided to check Limbaughs claim. A representative with Limbaughs radio network didnt answer an email inquiry. An unusual approach for a foundation When most people in the charitable world think of foundations, they think of organizations that give away a lot of money in the form of grants to others who go out and do good works. The Clinton foundation works differently -- it keeps its money in house and hires staff to carry out its own humanitarian programs. This set-up means the Clinton foundations finances get complicated in ways other foundations do not. Partly because of that, one of the leading independent groups that track charities -- Charity Navigator -- has been flummoxed about how to analyze that foundation and has stopped rating it, at least for now. Charity Navigator says it has determined that this charity's atypical business model cannot be accurately captured in our current rating methodology. Our removal of The Clinton Foundation from our site is neither a condemnation nor an endorsement of this charity. We reserve the right to reinstate a rating for The Clinton Foundation as soon as we identify a rating methodology that appropriately captures its business model. What is counted in the foundations financials? The Federalist article that Limbaugh cited dug into the Clinton foundations tax forms known as 990s, which nonprofits have to file annually with the Internal Revenue Service. Heres an excerpt from the Federalist article: When anyone contributes to the Clinton Foundation, it actually goes toward fat salaries, administrative bloat, and lavish travel. Between 2009 and 2012, the Clinton Foundation raised over $500 million dollars according to a review of IRS documents by The Federalist (2012, 2011, 2010, 2009, 2008). A measly 15 percent of that, or $75 million, went towards programmatic grants. More than $25 million went to fund travel expenses. Nearly $110 million went toward employee salaries and benefits. And a whopping $290 million during that period — nearly 60 percent of all money raised — was classified merely as other expenses.  The Clinton foundation, on the other hand, gets to its 88 percent going to life-changing work by combining the finances of the Clinton Foundation and an affiliated organization, the Clinton Health Access Initiative, that before 2010 had been part of the Clinton Foundation proper. The Clinton Health Access Initiative works with governments and private groups to lower the costs of treatment for HIV/AIDS in the developing world. The Clinton Health Access Initiative was split off from the foundation because they got so big they needed their own organization to do it, said Craig Minassian, a spokesman for the foundation, in an interview with PolitiFact. But in putting together its annual report for 2013, the Clinton Foundation folded together both groups before calculating the numbers. Some question the logic for doing it this way. Clinton allies are deliberately conflating the activities and finances of multiple independent nonprofit organizations and hoping you'll view everything together as The Clinton Foundation,  Sean Davis, who wrote the Federalist story, told PunditFactc. That's just not the case, though. The correct number for the Clinton Foundation alone -- which owned the account the tweet was sent from -- was just over 80 percent in 2013, not 88 percent. The Clinton Foundations unusual model As we noted earlier, many foundations carry out charitable works by giving money to other organizations that, in turn, do the ground-level charity work, whereas the Clinton foundations charitable works are mostly done by people on the foundations payroll. We are an implementing organization rather than a grantmaking organization, said the foundations Minassian. Thats why the Clinton Foundations 990s show a relatively small amount of money categorized as grants -- only about 10 percent of all expenses in 2013. The foundation says its own employees are doing its charitable work. The annual report -- which, remember, includes both the Clinton Foundation and the Clinton Health Access Initiative -- says that 7 percent of expenditures were spent on management and expenses and 4.5 percent for fundraising. (The numbers on the 990s for the two entities are in the same ballpark.) Add those two percentages together and you get almost 12 percent; subtract that from 100 percent and you get the magic 88 percent figure the foundation cited. An independent academic CPA who specializes in nonprofit foundation finances said Limbaughs error was in assuming that all spending beyond grants amounted to wasteful overhead. When Mr. Limbaugh says most of the spending is on salaries, travel, and other, that is not particularly informative, said Linda Parsons, an associate professor of accounting at the University of Alabama's Culverhouse College of Commerce. Travel and salaries for those who are directly carrying out the mission of the organization are much different than salaries and travel for executives who are networking in order to raise funds or for those who manage the organization. The response from the Clinton foundation that they carry out their missions directly, rather than outsource it to another organization or series of organizations, makes sense given that the Clinton Foundation reports travel, salaries, depreciation and conferences directly. Of course, Parsons interpretation depends on trusting the Clinton foundations characterization of its expenditures. As with any institution that files tax forms, the Clinton foundation has to characterize on its own what counts as management and what counts as spending on front-line charity work. The Federalist article says the foundations tweet exaggerates when it says money spent directly on life-changing work, when in fact the group, by its own calculations, spent nearly $8.5 million – 10 percent of all 2013 expenditures – on travel. Do plane tickets and hotel accommodations directly change lives? Nearly $4.8 million – 5.6 percent of all expenditures – was spent on office supplies. Are ink cartridges and staplers life-changing commodities? In response to a PolitiFact request, the Clinton Foundation said the expenditures for its programs are inclusive of salaries for staff, large-scale conferences (which is how the foundation convenes partners to take action such as the Clinton Global Initiative and the Health Matters conference), training for farmers and other beneficiaries, as well as direct program expenses like purchasing seeds and fertilizer for our agricultural programs and medical equipment for our public health work. Reasonable people can disagree about how to categorize expenses, said Janet S. Greenlee, emeritus professor of accounting at the University of Dayton business school. There is no approved, required, or suggested method for allocating costs between program and nonprogram spending, so two charities that have the same financial events may have totally different financials, Greenlee said. Limbaugh is saying everything thats not direct service must be a waste of money, while the foundation is probably estimating that most of its other costs are actually direct service and so are accounted as such. The truth, if there is such a thing, is somewhere in between. The foundation sent PolitiFact a rough geographic breakdown for program spending in 2012 and 2013. It cited expenditures split between 66.2 percent for the United States, 18.1 percent for South America, 5.6 percent for Southeast Asia, 4.9 percent for Sub-Saharan Africa, 3.6 percent for Central America and the Caribbean, 1.2 percent for West and Central Africa and 0.4 percent for Mexico. Thats more than we had expected to see in domestic spending -- were checking with the foundation on why that was so high, and will report their explanation if we receive one -- but even if the foundation devoted as little as one-third of its expenses to programs outside the U.S., then Limbaughs 15 percent estimate would be too low. To offer some context, spending 88 percent of expenses on charitable programs, as the Clinton foundation says it does, would actually be pretty good by industry standards. Parsons said the average reported across all organizations in the National Center for Charitable Statistics is 81 percent -- equal to the Clinton Foundations rate on its own -- and the Better Business Bureaus Wise Giving Alliance suggests a minimum of 65 percent. The foundation exceeds that, Parsons said. Our ruling Limbaugh said 85 percent of every dollar donated to the Clinton Foundation ended up either with the Clintons or with their staff to pay for travel, salaries, and benefits. Fifteen cents of every dollar actually went to some charitable beneficiary. Theres a grain of truth here -- roughly 85 percent of the foundations spending was for items other than charitable grants to other organizations, and a large chunk of this 85 percent did go to Clinton Foundation staff for travel, salaries and benefits. However, the foundation says it does most of its charitable work in-house, and its not credible to think that the foundation spent zero dollars beyond grants on any charitable work, which is what it would take for Limbaugh to be correct.",0.5,0.5,1,0.5,0,0.5,0.5,1,0.5,Half True

Final Rating: Mostly False  ",Says Betty Sutton and House Democrats gutted Medicare by $741 billion to pay for Obamacare.,"Mitt Romney rekindled a heated debate over Medicare by picking U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan as his running mate.Ryan, head of the Budget Committee in the U.S. House of Representatives, is the architect of a plan to dramatically restructure Medicare, which today operates as a government-run health insurance plan for Americans over age 65.Democratic congressional candidates are making the protection of traditional Medicare a centerpiece of their campaigns.The Republican response has been to attack back. In a series of news releases dealing with the national health care reform law, the National Republican Congressional Committee on Aug. 14 claimed 37 House Democrats are gutting $741 billion from Medicare to pay for the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare.One of those 37 Democrats was Rep. Betty Sutton. GOP Rep. Jim Renacci, her opponent in Ohio's newly redrawn 16th congressional district, repeated the claim the next day in a campaign fundraising email. We all know that our seniors were slapped with an estimated $500 billion blow to Medicare in 2010 when President Obama and Betty Sutton pushed through their healthcare law, which ended Medicare as we know it, the message said. Now, revised estimates by the Congressional Budget Office reveal Democrats gutted even more from Medicare than we first knew, taking $741 billion from seniors to fund ObamaCare. PolitiFact Ohio was interested.We have examined the claim that health care reform cuts Medicare by $500 billion on a number of occasions. The most recent was last May, when Renacci's campaign website said Sutton gutted Medicare by $500 billion to fund Obamacare.How did the claim climb from $500 billion to $741 billion?Renacci's email said: Revised estimates by the Congressional Budget Office reveal Democrats gutted even more from Medicare than we first knew, taking $741 billion from seniors to fund Obamacare.We asked Renacci's campaign how he backs up the statement. Except for the revised estimate from the Congressional Budget Office, the backup matched the sourcing for the earlier claim with $500 billion.Let's review, with the revised estimate.First, Obamacare does not literally cut a dollar amount from the Medicare programs budget. Rather, spending will grow.But the health care law instituted a number of changes to slow the programs future spending growth and try to contain future health care costs in the program. At the time the law was passed, those savings amounted to $500 billion over the next 10 years.At the time the health care law was being finalized and passed, Democrats said it was important to them that the new law not add to the deficit. So savings in Medicare spending were counted against the health care laws new spending. That spending is primarily to cover the uninsured, by giving them tax credits to buy private insurance. But some new spending increases Medicare coverage for prescription drugs for seniors.The efforts to limit future growth were mainly aimed at insurance companies and hospitals, not beneficiaries.The law makes significant changes to Medicare Advantage, a subset of Medicare plans run by private insurers. Medicare Advantage was started under President George W. Bush, and the idea was that competition among the private insurers would reduce costs. But in recent years the plans have actually cost more than traditional Medicare. So the health care law scales back the payments to private insurers.Hospitals, too, will be paid less if they have too many re-admissions, or if they fail to meet other new benchmarks for patient care.Obama and fellow Democrats say the intention is to protect beneficiaries' coverage while forcing health care providers to become more efficient.Under the new law, the overall Medicare budget is projected to go up for the foreseeable future. The health care law tries to limit that growth, making it less than it would have been without the law, but not reducing its overall budget.Because Medicare spending gets bigger every year, the figure for the savings also increases. Also, it takes a few years for the health care laws savings mechanisms to kick in. In fact, the effects of time are the main reason the $500 billion number has risen past $700 billion.The CBO determined in 2011 that the federal health care law would reduce Medicare outlays by $507 billion between 2012 and 2021. In its latest estimate released last month, the budget office looked at the years 2013 to 2022 and determined the health care law would reduce future Medicare spending by $716 billion. The $741 billion cited by the RNCC and Renacci includes that Medicare spending and money for other federal programs.So it is timing that's making the figures bigger, not changes to Medicare. The claim that Democrats support gutting Medicare is wrong -- program spending will still increase under Obamacare, but at a slower pace.There is an element of truth in Renaccis claim. The health care law seeks to reduce future Medicare spending, and the tally of those cost reductions over the next 10 years is $716 billion.But describing those savings as cuts that gut Medicare suggests a slashing of programs that is not in the law.On the Truth-O-Meter, the claim rates Mostly False.",0.2,0.9,0.8,0.5,0.4,0.8,0.6,0.7,0.3,Mostly False

Final Rating: Mostly False",Students today take more years to get through college.,"Newt Gingrich says too many college students are slackers. During a campaign event in Stuart, Fla., on Jan. 28, 2012, Newt Gingrich said college students are taking too long to graduate.Students take fewer classes per semester. They take more years to get through. Why? Because they have free money, Gingrich said. I would tell students: Get through as quick as you can. Borrow as little as you can. Have a part-time job. But thats very different from the culture that has grown up in the last 20 years.We wondered whether the statistics showed that students are indeed taking longer to graduate than they did in the past. So we looked into it.We turned to figures on post-secondary education compiled by the National Center for Education Statistics, a division of the U.S. Department of Education. As it turns out, the trend for four-year colleges is exactly the opposite.Percent of bachelors degree-seeking students completing bachelor's degrees within four years after start, at all four-year institutions So the percentage of students completing degrees within four years has actually risen incrementally in recent years. Between the graduating classes of 2000 and 2006, the percentage of students graduating in four years increased by one-sixth.So where four-year colleges are concerned, Gingrichs comment is off the mark. But Gingrich has a point in regard to two-year institutions.Percent completing certificates or associate's degrees within 150 percent of normal time, all two-year institutions So for two-year institutions, the rate did fall slightly, though by less than what the rate for four-year institutions rose.Christopher Swanson, the vice president for research and development at Editorial Projects in Education, the publisher of Education Week, said that in general, education experts havent been worried so much that the trendlines for college completion are going in the wrong direction. The main narrative you hear about (concerns) the low completion rates in general, he said. On that score, he said, there doesnt seem to be a whole lot to write home about.Swanson did take issue with the general tenor of Gingrichs comments -- that you should borrow as little as you can and instead get a job if you want to increase the likelihood that youll finish college on time.That seems to fly in the face of what I think is a pretty well-established finding from the research that working during college or post-secondary education tends to be detrimental in terms of completion (that is, that youre less likely to complete) and time to completion (that it takes longer), Swanson said. There may be any number of issues and problems with excessive student borrowing, but being able to borrow for college does allow students the opportunity to focus more exclusively on their school work than would probably have been the case otherwise. If you follow the dont borrow/get a job argument and play that out a bit, that sounds a lot like what happens as a matter of course in community colleges. And the completion rates there are extremely low, on the order of one-third completing within an extended timeline.Our rulingGingrich said that students today take more years to get through college. While graduation rates are lower than experts would like them to be, it's not true that students are taking longer to graduate from four-year institutions. The percentage graduating on time at four-year colleges has actually risen consistently in recent years. The only exception to this pattern is at two-year colleges, where the percentage of students graduating within three years has fallen slightly. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/670cf7ee-39a3-41a7-9d3a-e6c3459864a0",0,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,Mostly False

Final Rating: Half True  ","As for recreational marijuana revenue projections, we are seeing all those numbers reach disappointing levels in the states that have legalized. Theyre not meeting their targets for the most part.","Gov. Andrew Cuomo wants New York state to legalize recreational marijuana. Some state lawmakers, including Assembly Majority Leader Crystal Peoples-Stokes, D-Buffalo, have long supported the idea. But there has been pushback to Cuomos proposal. Assemblymember Patricia Fahy, a Democrat from the Albany area, favors starting with decriminalization but raises concerns about youth usage and driving under the influence, among other issues. Fahy wrote an op-ed in the Times-Union of Albany and discussed her concerns in media interviews. In an interview with radio host Susan Arbetter, Fahy questioned how much tax money New York state would collect if recreational marijuana became legal. Everybody thinks that this is going to be a massive money-maker, she said. There are projections of $200 to $400 million additional in New York state. We are seeing all those numbers reach disappointing levels in the states that have legalized. Theyre not meeting their targets for the most part.  The Cuomo administration predicts $300 million in tax revenue from the sale of recreational marijuana once legalization is fully phased in, according to budget materials. But is Fahy correct? Have other states missed their revenue targets?  Ten other states and the District of Columbia have legalized recreational marijuana, though Vermont and DC do not allow commercial sales. An assessment by New York State agencies on the effects of legalization, published in July 2018, warned that some states overestimated revenue initially, as they did not account for the length of time it takes for a recreational market to be established, leading to fewer than expected sales. We asked Fahys spokesman, Alexander Flood, for evidence of her claim. He pointed us to California, where the state collected less than it anticipated in the first full year of marijuana sales after a rocky rollout. He also referred us to reporting that showed that Colorados revenues didnt meet expectations in the beginning. The complexity of the laws at the state level being rolled out has, in turn, complicated revenue projections for these states, Flood wrote in an email. We looked at revenue results in states that have legalized commercial sales: Maine is still working on its rules and regulations, and Michigan just legalized in November 2018. While many states have seen impressive growth in revenue, predicting future revenue may be complicated. States have a difficult time predicting usage, pricing and how legalization in nearby states affect tax revenues, according to a report from Pew Charitable Trusts and the Rockefeller Institute for Government, both nonpartisan organizations. However, researchers wrote that volatility in marijuana tax collections has been less of an issue and has primarily stemmed from seasonality.  Fahy said states that have legalized recreational marijuana are not meeting their targets for the most part. It is true that, at first,some states struggled to meet their targets because of a slower than expected rollout of legalization. This occurred in Colorado, California and Alaska. Revenue, however, has grown in Colorado and Alaska. Oregon, Washington stateand Nevada never had problems reaching their targets. To say that states arent meeting their revenue targets for the most part doesnt give a clear picture of whats happening with legalized marijuana in the states.

The ad starts with a narrator saying Sheila Bynum-Coleman said and cuts to a tape of the candidate saying, We need to get the police out of the schools. Get the police out of the schools. Then the ad shows four real moms, not actors, sitting at a kitchen table, holding coffee mugs and disagreeing with Bynum-Coleman. Thats scary,the first woman says. I dont want my kids in an environment where theyre not going to be safe. The second woman says police are heroes. The third says the officers are at schools as an added layer of protection.

During much of commercial, theres type on the screen saying, We need to get the police out of the schools - Sheila Bynum-Coleman. Bynum-Coleman says Cox has distorted comments she made two years ago. So we fact-checked Coxs ad claim. The commercial cites as its source an Oct. 9, 2017 podcast interview of Bynum-Coleman by Marcello Rollando, a performing arts director and liberal activist. Bynum-Coleman was asked for her thoughts on the school to prison pipeline, the trend of a disproportionate number of black students being expelled from schools or arrested. In a lengthy reply, Bynum-Colemansaid many schools were relegating routine student discipline to on-site police and security guards. She did say we need to get the police out of the schools, as Cox claims in his ad. But the commercial omits Bynum Coleman saying in her next breath the officers are needed to provide safety. Here are her expanded remarks: But now we have police in the school who are policing our children, you know we dont want children to get into fights, we dont want them walking into class late, we dont want them being disruptive in the classrooms, but do we want to send them to prison? I think theres an alternative here and I think we need to get the police out of the schools. The police need to be there for safety measures and to make sure the school is safe, not to incarcerate the children and deal with disciplinary actions, and thats whats taking place. A few minutes later, Bynum-Coleman said, I think that the police should only be there to make sure the school is safer and secure. They should not have any dealings with disciplinary actions within the school. Rob Silverstein, Bynum-Colemans campaign manager, sent us an email calling Cox's adincredibly misleading and deceptive, and it presents a clearly false impression of what she said. Parker Slaybaugh, spokesman for Cox, stood by the ad. It's pretty hard to be a misrepresentation of Ms. Bynum-Coleman, when the ad uses a recording of her own words, he said. Our ruling Coxs ad saysSheila Bynum-Coleman said, We need to get the police out of schools. Bynum-Coleman used those words in a lengthy answer she gave to a question about the prison-to-school pipeline, affecting many black students. But in her next sentence, she explained that police need to be on hand to make sure the school is safe, not to incarcerate the children and deal with disciplinary actions and thats whats taking place. And she elaborated a few minutes later, I think that the police should only be there to make sure the school is safeand secure. They should not have any dealings with disciplinary actions within the school.

In Bladen County, there were only 569 unreturned absentee mail-in ballots, Woodhouse said in an e-mail to PolitFact on Monday night. Moreover, 175 of these voters actually cast a ballot by another method. This leaves only 394 truly unreturned ballots in Bladen County, certainly not enough ballots to change the result of the election with a margin of 905 votes. Woodhouse has a point that theres a gap between the number of absentee-by-mail votes in Bladen County (an unofficial total of 684 for all candidates, combined) and the 905 total votes by which McCready trails Harris. However, the NC GOP claim gives the misleading impression that the mail-in ballots counted in Bladen County are the only ones in question by the NC elections board. Thats not the case. What the elections board has said Woodhouse has criticized the lack of transparency around the investigation, and hes right that the NC elections board has revealed little about the case in the 9th Congressional District, which runs from Charlotte eastward past Fayetteville along the South Carolina border. The board has released two public statements about the investigation. On Nov. 27, the board announced in a statement that it wasnt certifying the results. In his motion, Board Vice Chairman Joshua Malcolm cited the Boards authority underG.S. 163A-1180as the reason for delaying certification of that contest, the statement says. That statute gives the Board the authority to take any other action necessary to assure that an election is determined without taint of fraud or corruption and without irregularities that may have changed the result of an election.  Then, on Nov. 30, the board announced its intention to hold a public evidentiary hearing into claims of irregularities and fraudulent activities related to absentee by-mail voting and potentially other matters in the 9th Congressional District contest. The NC elections board cited the Bladen irregularities as a reason for not certifying the Harris-McCready contest results, but the statement didnt say investigators would limit their review to that county alone. The elections board hasnt publicly disclosed: Questions remain not only about mail-in ballots that were returned and counted, but also about ballots that were requested but never returned. First, lets look at the mail-in ballots that were counted. Unusual voting trends Eight counties are wholly or partly included in the district and Bladen was the only county in the district in which Harris had more mail-in support than McCready. (Unofficial results can be found on theNC elections board website.) In six of the counties, fewer than 3 percent of total votes were absentee-by-mail ballots, according to aFiveThirtyEightnews analysis of NC elections board data. But in Bladen County, that number was 7.3 percent, suggesting a push to get people there to vote by mail, FiveThirtyEight reported. Harris won 61 percent of the votes from mail-in ballots in Bladen County — even though registered Republicansaccounted for only 19 percentof the countys accepted absentee ballots, an independent analysis by Catawba College political scientist Michael Bitzer showed. Harriss Bladen County support stands out from the Republican primary, too. In May, Harris beat incumbent Rep. Robert Pittenger by 828 votes and was aided by a 400-vote advantage by absentee by-mail ballots in Bladen County. That figure is more than double the mail-in total in most other 9th District counties. And Bladen was the only county where Harris had a substantial absentee by-mail advantage over Pittenger. Back to the general election. Bladen County had the highest percentage of absentee ballot requests in the state, according to theCharlotte Observer. However, the number of unreturned ballots have raised eyebrows. Unreturned ballots On average, about 16 percent of registered voters who request mail-in ballots never return them, according to Bitzer. In the Harris-McCready district, the non-return rate was 24 percent. In Bladen County alone, 40 percent of the requested mail-in ballots were never returned. And in neighboring Robeson County, 60 percent were never returned, according to aNews & Observer review. The N&O found that the unreturned ballots are disproportionately associated with minority voters. In terms of actual votes, Bitzer reported that 495 ballots were requested but never returned in Bladen and 1,180 were requested but never returned in Robeson. AsFiveThirtyEightnoted, Robeson had more unreturned ballots than Mecklenburg County (home to Charlotte) despite Mecklenburg casting three times as many total votes as Robeson. Its certainly possible that some people requested ballots and then lost their ballot or moved or forgot to vote. The elections board is likely to review the situation. Steve Stone, chairman of the Robeson County Board of Elections, told The Washington Post that state investigators have requested information the county board kept on an unusual number of absentee ballot requests. County residents reported to the Robeson board that people were going door-to-door telling voters that their registrations had been dropped and they needed to re-register, Stone told the Post. Its illegal to take someone elses mail-in ballot and turn it inunless youre related to them. Yet, a few voters filed affidavits with the NC board of elections stating that they were approached in their homes by someone claiming to be a ballot collector. Much to be determined Monday night, NC elections board spokesman Pat Gannon emailed PolitiFact to clarify the scope of the investigation. The easy answer is that the scope is absentee voting irregularities in the 9th CD, Gannons email said. Investigators will go where the evidence takes them, including ballots not returned. We dont know whether there are enough ballots in question. Thats part of what the investigation is trying to determine. Ultimately, the exact number of altered votes and destroyed ballots may be irrelevant, according to Bitzer and Gerry Cohen, former special counsel to the N.C. General Assembly and longtime legislative staffer. In separate emails to PolitiFact, they pointed to NC General Statutes Section 163A-1181 with regards to New elections. The law says the state elections board can order a new election by majority vote if irregularities or improprieties occurred to such an extent that they taint the results of the entire election and cast doubt on its fairness. Our ruling The NC GOP says there arent enough ballots in question to change the outcome of this election. Theres a gap between the number of mail-in votes cast in Bladen County (684) and the 905 votes by which McCready trails Harris. But its possible -- if not likely -- that the NC elections board is examining more than just the absentee-by-mail ballots that were cast. The board hasnt publicly defined the scope of its investigation. Investigators could be examining the 684 mail-votes from Bladen County, the 680 mail-in votes from Robeson County, as well as the combined 1,675 mail-in ballots that werent returned from either county. The N.C. GOP hasnt presented evidence to prove that the NC elections board is focusing solely on the mail-in ballots that were already counted in Bladen County. In fact, theyve criticized the board for lacking transparency. We believe Woodhouse and the NC GOPs claim meets the definition of aMostly False claim: it contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.",0.5,0.5,1.0,0.5,0.0,0.5,0.5,1.0,0.5,Mostly False

Final Rating: Mostly True",Says Roy Moore is on the wrong side of Trumps border wall.,"If top Republicans in Washington have their way, Alabama Republican Roy Moore wont be the GOP Senate nominee. President Donald Trump and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell have both come out for Moores chief opponent, Luther Strange. In the latest salvo, the Senate Leadership Fund, a super PAC run by McConnells former chief of staff, aired an ad that essentially tells viewers that Moore opposes Trumps wall along the Mexican border.Heres the full text: Male voice: Who will fight with President Trump to change Washington? Not career politician Roy Moore. Hes on the wrong side of Trumps border wall. Video clip of Moore: Ill tell you a little secret. Does it take a wall? Video clip of Moore: I dont think it would take a wall. Repeats the same clip of Moore: I dont think it would take a wall. Male voice: Roy Moore. Dead wrong on President Trumps wall to protect our borders. Audio clip of Moore: You cant build a wall around our country. This is a case where the individual elements of the ad hold up, but the package deal paints an incomplete picture. The ad uses video selectively. A good example comes from the rest of Moores words at the forum where he said, I dont think it would take a wall. Heres a more complete excerpt of his remarks: I think we need something to stop illegal aliens flowing across our borders, because they are a danger to our republic, a danger to our homes, our families, and we can do something, Moore said at the Wetumpka T.E.A. Party candidate forum on July 31. I support using federal troops (and the) National Guard to stop this. A moment later, he continued, If it takes a wall, we should build it. I don't think it would take a wall. I think we should use the United States military. In an Aug. 15 radio interview, Moore expressed impatience with the pace of fortifying the border. Here we are, waiting since November and nothings been done in stopping illegal aliens, Moore said. It can be stopped within days by the U.S. military ... We need to stop illegal aliens coming in and then, if a wall is necessary and weve got the money, we can build it. Moores campaign website says, We must allow willing states (like Arizona) to protect the health, safety, and welfare of their citizens, and use our own military to protect our border. If a wall is our only option, then we should build it immediately. Chris Pack, a spokesman for the Senate Leadership Fund, said Moores stance is at variance with Trumps position. Roy Moore has repeatedly said he doesnt think we need a wall and that it should be the last recourse, or as the last thing we need to do, Pack said. President Trump, by contrast, has called the wall absolutely necessary, so vital, and very, very important.  Pack went on to say, Our ad is simply pointing out that Roy Moore is not with Trump in pushing for the wall. Advocates of the wall argue that, unlike a military deployment, it would be a barrier that would outlast any change in leadership or policy in Washington. The Senate Leadership Fund ad describes Moore as being on the wrong side of Trumps border wall. Based on that and the clips in the ad, most viewers might reasonably think that means Moore is against a wall. In fact, Moore doesnt want to wait and would rather deploy the American military immediately to secure the border with Mexico. If after that a wall is needed, he said the country should build it. What we have is more of a difference on tactics, not overall strategy or outcomes. The ad makes it sound like the gap is more than that. The ad contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts the would give a different impression.",0.8,0.7,1.0,0.6,0.5,0.5,0.4,1.0,0.6,Mostly True

Final Rating: Mostly False  ","Wisconsin's Lincoln Hills youth prison has a 66 percent recidivism rate, while states like Missouri, that have more of a regional model -- 8 percent.","For two years, Wisconsins youth prison for males has been under an FBI-led criminal investigation into allegations of prisoner abuse, child neglect, sexual assault, intimidation of witnesses and victims, strangulation and tampering with public records. Should the facility, Lincoln Hills School, be shut down? That question was posed to Wisconsin Assembly Minority Leader Gordon Hintz in an interview on Nov. 21, 2017, the day after the Oshkosh Democrat toured Lincoln Hills. Responding to Wisconsin Eye TV host Steven Walters, Hintz said an alternative would have to be developed first. Then he made a statement that seemed to indict the facility, saying: We have a 66 percent recidivism rate for the kids there, in the three years after they get out. States like Missouri, that have more of a regional model -- 8 percent. So, 66 percent of Lincoln Hills inmates commit new offenses within three years of being released? And thats eight times higher than in states such as Missouri, which has been held up as a potential model for Wisconsin? Well see that, as national experts have stated, comparing states on juvenile recidivism is not easily done. The trouble at Lincoln Hills Lincoln Hills generally holds inmates as young as 13 and as old as 25, with most inmates in their mid-to late-teens; some adults are being held for crimes they committed as juveniles. Incarcerating an inmate there costs more than $100,000 a year. Groups such as Youth Justice Milwaukee, which is calling for Wisconsins youth prisons to be closed, argue that conditions at Lincoln Hills can lead to higher recidivism -- inmates committing new offenses after theyre released. Milwaukee County Executive Chris Abele has gone even further than Hintz, saying 75 percent of Lincoln Hills inmates fall back into criminal activity. Meanwhile, Missouri -- when facing problems similar to those at Lincoln Hills, such as fights between inmates, long stints in solitary confinement and injuries inflicted by guards -- replaced large institutions with small facilities, closer to young offenders' homes. But the contrast in recidivism between the two states is not how Hintz portrays it. Hintzs partially accurate evidence To back Hintzs claim, his office cited a January 2017 report by the nonpartisan Wisconsin Legislative Fiscal Bureau. It says that according to the latest available data, Lincoln Hills has a three-year recidivism rate of 63 percent. That is, 278 juveniles were released from Lincoln Hills in 2011 and 63 percent returned to either a juvenile correctional facility or an adult prison, or were placed on probation for a new offense, by 2014. So, Hintzs claim of a 66 percent recidivism rate at Lincoln Hills is high by only three percentage points. Missouris definition of recidivism is roughly similar to Wisconsins, but has four parts. It includes youths who are sent back to the juvenile system, are sent to adult prison, are put on probation, or are put into a 120-day program. But the latest State of Missouri figures show Missouris three-year recidivism rate, for 2013 to 2016, is 30 percent. Thats far less than Lincoln Hills 63 percent. But its also much higher than the 8 percent Hintz claimed. That lower rate applies only to the first part of Missouris recidivism definition -- youths who commit new offenses and are sent back to the youth system. Apples and oranges There are also other problems with comparing Lincoln Hills to Missouri: Lincoln Hills Missouri Latest three-year recidivism rate is 2011-2014 Latest recidivism rate is 2013-2016 Only male inmates Male and female offenders Inmates have committed serious, violent crimes — including homicide and robbery — or have had repeated run-ins with the law and didnt turn their behavior around after being sent to group homes. Youths have committed a wide variety of offenses, from serious felonies to truancy and curfew violations. Those create a major apples-to-oranges problem for Hintzs statement, particularly the fact Missouris count includes many less serious offenders than Lincoln Hills. Our rating Hintz says Wisconsin's Lincoln Hills youth prison has a 66 percent recidivism rate, while states like Missouri, that have more of a regional model -- 8 percent. He is essentially correct on Wisconsin. The latest figures show that 63 percent of Lincoln Hills offenders are returned to either a juvenile correctional facility or an adult prison, or were placed on probation for a new offense, within three years of being released. But the comparison to Missouri misses on several counts. Missouri reports a three-year youth recidivism rate of 30 percent, not 8 percent -- and even that is misleading. While Lincoln Hills incarcerates only serious male offenders, Missouris youth correctional system includes males and females who commit offenses ranging from serious crimes to truancy. So, Hintz is comparing two significantly different populations. Hintzs statement contains an element of truth, but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression -- our definition of Mostly False.

Final Rating: Half True  ",Iranian mullahs took American hostages and they held the American hostages for 444 days. ...The one hour in which they released them was the one hour in which Ronald Reagan was taking the Oath of Office ,"Rudy Giuliani invokes his tough-on-terrorism image with a television advertisement about the Iran hostage crisis. He gets most of the facts correct but his insinuation that President Reagan deserves all the credit for the hostages' release is wrong. Here is the transcript of his 30-second commercial, spoken as grainy black and white photos of hostages appear on the screen: I remember back to the 1970s and the early 1980s. Iranian mullahs took American hostages and they held the American hostages for 444 days. And they released the American hostages in one hour, and that should tell us a lot about these Islamic terrorists that we're facing. The one hour in which they released them was the one hour in which Ronald Reagan was taking the Oath of Office as President of the United States. The best way you deal with dictators, the best way you deal with tyrants and terrorists, you stand up to them. You don't back down. I'm Rudy Giuliani and I approve this message. The script is technically accurate. On Nov. 4, 1979, militant Iranian students — not mullahs, as Giuliani says — took control of the U.S. Embassy in Tehran, taking 66 hostages. Of those, 52 remained in captivity for 444 days. The terms of their release is the Algiers Accord, an agreement negotiated by Jimmy Carter's administration on Jan. 19, 1981, according to State Department documents. The following day at 12:23 p.m. EST, less than one hour after Carter relinquished the presidency to Ronald Reagan, the hostages were let go. But just because it happened on Reagan's watch, doesn't mean he deserves credit, said Warren Christopher, Carter's deputy Secretary of State and lead negotiator for the United States. It happened that they did not hit Algiers until (Reagan) was in office about a half-hour, Christopher said. But all the negotiations took place before the inauguration. Temple University professor David Farber and journalist Mark Bowden both wrote books about the Iranian hostage situation and reach similar conclusions. The whole direction is misleading, Farber said. Reagan had made no claims he would do something specifically different. There was no cause-and-effect relationship. (Giuliani) is reporting one of the standard glib historical assessments of the hostage crisis, Bowden said. The idea that Reagan had any affect on their release is laughable. Bowden said waiting until Carter left office had more to do with the Iranian leaders dislike of Carter than a fear of Reagan, he added. While Giuliani is technically correct that the hostages were released after 444 days in the first hour Reagan took office, Reagan wasn't responsible. So Giuliani's message doesn't match the facts. We rule this statement Barely True. ",0.5,0.7,1.0,0.6,0.3,0.6,0.5,1.0,0.4,Half True

Final Rating: Mostly False  ",The United States cant import baby formula because of the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement.,"A recent Twitter post claimed the United States trade policy with its North American neighbors is the reason why theres a shortage of baby formula nationwide. Why cant we just import baby formula? the May 14 tweet said. Ever heard of the United States Canada Mexico Agreement? That bit of legislation Trump and Republicans proudly replaced NAFTA with? Remember Trump bragging about that? Remember? That. That's why. We found a similar claim on Facebook. The post was flagged as part of Facebooks efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement, which officially replaced the North American Free Trade Agreement in July 2020, did overhaul the countrys trade policies with Canada and Mexico. But claiming that trade agreement is the sole reason the U.S. cant import baby formula vastly oversimplifies the issue. The U.S. can import baby formula, but in a typical year, about 98% of the infant formula consumed in the U.S. is domestically produced. Only a small amount of formula is imported from other countries, such as Mexico, Ireland, the Netherlands, Chile and Austria. The importation of baby formula is subject to high tariffs and complex policies that aim to protect the U.S. dairy industry from competitors and ensure that formula is safe to consume. Domestic and foreign manufacturers alike must adhere to government regulations and undergo review by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in order to have their products approved for sale in the U.S. The FDA requires baby formula to meet certain ingredient and nutrition requirements, and the products must follow specific labeling guidelines. For instance, the labels must be in English, except in areas where English is not the predominant language. Once a baby formula product receives FDA approval, retailers must then wait 90 days before marketing it. Its a very heavily involved regulatory process, which is why its difficult to import baby formula, said Gabby Beaumont-Smith, a policy analyst at the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank. The U.S. also requires foreign companies importing baby formula to pay tariffs of up to 17.5%. Additional duties can be placed on formula imports if they exceed a certain amount. These tariffs, as well as the FDA regulations, existed before the USMCA was adopted. But the new trade deal did make some changes to the importation of baby formula from Canada and Mexico. Provisions in the trade agreement limit how much baby formula Canada can export globally each year and impose charges if the exports exceed a certain amount. Currently, if Canadian businesses export more than 40,480 metric tons collectively, they would be subject to an export charge of $4.25 (Canadian dollars) per kilogram. The U.S. didnt import any baby formula from Canada in 2021. This limit was imposed at U.S. authorities'insistencebecause there was concern before the new trade deal that Canada was dumping powdered milk products, which includes baby formula, said Andrew Novaković, a professor of agricultural economics at Cornell University. Dumping is when a country or company persistently sells their product to a foreign buyer at a price considered to be at a loss, usually for the purpose of simply gaining market share or punishing their foreign competitor, Novaković said. Meanwhile, under the USMCA, Mexico is one of the few U.S. trading partners that can import baby formula duty-free. Only a small amount of baby formula, roughly 12,000 metric tons, was imported from Mexico last year, according to the U.S. International Trade Commission. On May 16, the FDA announced new guidance on the importation of baby formula to help increase the availability of the product in stores across the U.S. The FDA is prioritizing manufacturers that have the largest volume of product available, can get their products onto shelves the quickest, and can demonstrate their product meets the agencys safety and nutrition standards. Social media posts claimed that the U.S. cant import baby formula due to the USMCA replacing NAFTA. Importing baby formula to the U.S. is allowed, although these imports usually only make up about 2% of all baby formula consumption in the country. The USMCA did make some changes to how baby formula is imported to the U.S., but many other regulatory policies affect imports, too. The trade agreement is not the only barrier to the U.S. importing more formula.",0.3,0.8,0.9,0.4,0.1,0.6,0.7,0.9,0.5,Mostly False

Final Rating: Mostly False  ","Seven hundred thousand. Thats how many California jobs will be lost thanks to the politicians raising the minimum wage.Now Florida is adding one million jobs, not losing them.","Florida Gov. Rick Scott is not on board with the minimum wage increase in the sunny, oceanside state — of California. As Scott toured the West Coast for the second time attempting to attract businesses, Enterprise Florida (the states public-private economic development arm) ran radio ads in San Francisco and Los Angeles attacking Californias $15 wage and trumpeting Floridas superior job prospects. Seven hundred thousand. Thats how many California jobs will be lost thanks to the politicians raising the minimum wage, the ad says, as the Miami Herald reports. Ready to leave California? Go to Florida instead — no state income tax, and Gov. Scott has cut regulations. Now Florida is adding 1 million jobs, not losing them. California Gov. Jerry Brown didnt take this lying down, penning a letter welcoming Scott back to California, a state that in the last year has added more jobs than Florida and Texas combined, and not-so-subtly suggested Scott worry about more pressing matters back home. Rick, a fact youd like to ignore: California is the 7th largest economic power in the world. Were competing with nations like Brazil and France, not states like Florida, Brown wrote on May 2. If youre truly serious about Floridas economic well-being, its time to stop the silly political stunts and start doing something about climate change – two words you wont even let state officials say. The threat is real and so too will be the devastating impacts. Here, well look at Scotts claim that California will lose almost as many jobs as Florida will gain. The ad is comparingCalifornia's projected employment with Florida's past performance — an apples-to-oranges comparison.Italso distorts what the 700,000 jobs-lost figure actually refers to. Even with the wage hike, California is expected to gain more jobs than Florida over the next decade, albeit not as many as without it. Furthermore, all the economists we spoke with cautioned against pinning a figure to the minimum wage hikes impact on employment in California. All that glitters in Golden State jobs A spokesperson for Scott cited a post by American Action Forum, a self-described center-right policy institute, as the source of the 700,000 lost jobs. But the figure doesnt refer to a decline in the total number jobs in the state, as the ad suggests. Rather, its the difference between the number of jobs that California could have gained without and with the wage hike. California will gradually increase the current $10 hourly minimum wage to $15 by 2022. According to the institute's labor market policy director, Ben Gitis, that will lead to a 3.5 percent decrease in employment growth or about 692,235 jobs by 2026 that could have been added if the wage did not increase. Gitis walked us through his math. He used the California Employment Development Departments latest 10-year forecast, which projects that the state will add 14.9 percent or 2.3 million more jobs from 2012 to 2022. Gitis then calculated the impact of the minimum wage hike; he concluded that California would see its projected 2026 jobs numbers reduced by 3.5 percent. In other words, California would have added about 3.4 million new jobs from 2012 to 2026 without the hike, but 2.7 million with it. So the state isnt so much losing 700,000 jobs as forgoing them, said Jeremy West, an economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who co-authored the Journal of Human Resources study Gitis used for his calculations. Bright employment outlook in Sunshine State Scotts office forwarded us a press release that says Florida has added more than a million jobs since 2010, a claim that PolitiFact Florida rated Mostly True. But Scott was talking about future projections for California, so well look instead at the number of jobs Florida will gain in the same time frame as Gitis analysis. From 2012 to 2026, Florida is actually projected to add more than a million jobs. The increase, however, will still be less than Californias. (We would be remiss to not mention that Californias cost of living is higherthan Florida's and its population size is almost twice as big.But as Enterprise Florida touted raw employment numbers, well follow suit.) Florida added about 552,000 jobs from Dec. 2012 to Dec. 2015. According to the Florida Dept. of Economic Opportunity, the state will gain 1.1 million more jobs from 2015 to 2023. Thats a compounded annual growth rate of 1.5 percent, equal to about 445,000new jobs from 2023 to 2026. Put it all together, Florida will add 2.1million jobs from 2012 to 2026. Thats still 600,000 fewerjobs than California will add in the same time frame with the $15 wage. Waging in uncharted waters As we have previously reported, theres a great amount of debate over the effect that minimum wage hikes have job growth. A spokesperson for Brown forwarded usacademic and think-tank studies showing that past increases have had little or no effect on employment. Californias hike, however, is so unprecedented that past research may be less relevant. All the experts we spoke with suspect it will reduce employment. An increase the size of Californias is outside of the experience of any state over the last four decades, said Jonathan Meer, a Texas A&M University economist and co-author of the study Gitis cited. A dramatic increase in the minimum wage like Californias will undoubtedly reduce employment. However, I would be very cautious about putting any precise figures on the amount. Two home-state economists — Jeffrey Clemens of the University of California, San Diego and David Neumark of the University of California, Irvine — agreed that the huge wage hike will likely cause job losses, but the magnitude is uncertain.  The recently passed minimum wage increases are sufficiently beyond the range of historical experience that I do not think it is possible to predict their effects on employment with any precision, Clemens said. Neumark added that Scotts job-poaching mission is nonetheless ill-fated, given that the flow of jobs into or out of California is typically miniscule and the jobs most affected by hike (low-skill jobs in the service and agricultural sectors) are hard to move out of state. Maybe a few low-wage manufacturers will move. But there's no reason to expect they'd go to Florida more than many other low-wage states or overseas, so I suspect the employment growth in Florida from Californias minimum wage increase would be negligible, and statistically undetectable, Neumark said. So Gov. Scott is probably wasting his and his Florida taxpayers' time. Our ruling A radio ad by Enterprise Florida said, Seven hundred thousand. Thats how many California jobs will be lost thanks to the politicians raising the minimum wage.Now Florida is adding 1 million jobs, not losing them. This is misleading. The 700,000 figure refers to the number of jobs California could have added by 2026 if it didnt increase the minimum wage, not a decline in net employment. Based on projections, California will still gain more jobs with the minimum wage increase than Florida during the same time frame. While experts agreed that a $15 wage will reduce employment in California, they said its near impossible to pin a number on the impact given how unprecedented the hike is.

Final Rating: False  ","Joe Biden puts pro-life groups on domestic extremist list, calls pro-life people violent.","On his third day in office, some two weeks after the attack on the U.S. Capitol, President Joe Biden ordered a federal assessment of the threat posed by domestic violent extremism. On March 17, the federal government released an unclassified summary of the assessment, prompting this headline widely shared on Facebook: Joe Biden puts pro-life groups on domestic extremist list, calls pro-life people violent. The headline was shared in posts by the Illinois Family Institute, the Facebook group Pro-life Politics, and Ohio Value Voters, Inc. It was surfaced to PolitiFact by VineSight, a firm that tracks online misinformation. The headline distorts what the assessment really found. The intelligence summary says that among the various types of domestic violent extremists are those with ideological agendas in support of pro-life or pro-choice beliefs. In other words, the report doesnt say that anti-abortion groups — or abortion-rights groups, for that matter — are domestic extremists. Rather, it says that some groups that are identified as domestic extremists have ideological agendas for or against abortion. The headline shared on Facebook is from an article on LifeNews.com. That article describes another article from the Christian Post about the summary report from the Office of the Director of National Intelligence. The four-page report, titled Domestic Violent Extremism Poses Heightened Threat in 2021, begins by stating that domestic violent extremists (DVEs) who are motivated by a range of ideologies and galvanized by recent political and societal events in the United States pose an elevated threat to the Homeland in 2021. A domestic violent extremist is defined as an individual based and operating primarily in the United States without direction or inspiration from a foreign terrorist group or other foreign power and who seeks to further political or social goals wholly or in part through unlawful acts of force or violence. The report says that lone offenders or small cells of domestic violent extremists adhering to a diverse set of violent extremist ideologies are more likely to carry out violent attacks than organizations that allegedly advocate a DVE ideology. It also says that racially or ethnically motivated violent extremists and militia violent extremists present the most lethal threats. The report concludes with a brief mention of abortion-related groups in its listing of five categories of domestic violent extremists: Racially or ethnically motivated violent extremists Anti-government/anti-authority violent extremists Animal rights/environmental violent extremists Abortion-related violent extremists — that is, domestic violent extremists with ideological agendas in support of pro-life or pro-choice beliefs All other domestic terrorism threats A headline widely shared on Facebook claims that Biden puts pro-life groups on domestic extremist list, calls pro-life people violent. An assessment ordered by Biden on the threat posed by domestic violent extremism says that one category of so-called domestic violent extremists are those that have ideological agendas in support of pro-life or pro-choice beliefs. It does not label anti-abortion groups generally as domestic violent extremists, or as violent.",0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,False

Final Rating: Mostly False","There is a consensus among economists left, right, and center that we cant spend too much on COVID-19 relief.","President Joe Biden has made beating the coronavirus and repairing the economic damage it unleashed his defining priorities. The central pillar of his strategy is a $1.9 trillion recovery plan. At a CNN town hall in Milwaukee, host Anderson Cooper asked Biden if he was committed to passing a $1.9 trillion bill, or if the number was up for negotiation. Biden responded as though there was no need for discussion. He said support for his package came from economists left, right and center. The overwhelming consensus is: In order to grow the economy a year or two, three, and four down the line, we cant spend too much, Biden said Feb. 16. Now is the time we should be spending. Now is the time to go big. Economists across the political spectrum have indeed embraced delivering substantial relief, but when it comes to the total price tag, theres more debate than he describes. Including among Democrats. In early February, former Obama administration Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers voiced concerns. In a Washington Post op-ed, Summers warned that while the bill had to be big, there was a risk of overshoot. Spending too much on COVID-19, Summers said, would squeeze out money for other big plans, from infrastructure to renewable energy to preschool. After resolving the coronavirus crisis, how will political and economic space be found for the public investments that should be the nations highest priority? Summers wrote. Summers was not alone. The former chief economist for the International Monetary Fund, Olivier Blanchard, said $1.9 trillion was too much. Blanchard agreed with the plans main goals — spending on vaccines and health care, protecting the people who lost jobs and boosting demand. But Blanchard didnt reach Bidens total. When you make the sum of all these needs, which are real and have to be satisfied, you don't get to $1.9 trillion. You get to a smaller number, Blanchard said Feb. 8. Blanchards ballpark number was $1 trillion. Desmond Lachman, an economist at the American Enterprise Institute, a market-oriented think tank, agreed that there is consensus across the ideological spectrum in favor of additional economic stimulus. The supporters include Lachmans onetime colleague at the institute Kevin Hassett, who joined the Trump administration as the chair of the Council of Economic Advisers. Hassett told CNN that he broadly supports Bidens $1.9 trillion package. But Lachman said theres uneven support for that level of spending. There are many economists who think that a package as large as a $1.9 trillion package is inviting trouble, Lachman said. Lachman, like the other more cautious economists, worries about overheating the economy with too much cash. The resulting inflation would lead to higher interest rates, which, Lachman argues, would send world financial markets into a tailspin. Ever eager to foster stability, the U.S. Federal Reserve offered calming words on that front. Chairman Jerome Powell said Feb. 10 that if a burst of spending drives prices up, he doesnt think it would last, nor would it automatically trigger a rate increase. A recent survey puts some numbers to the range of opinions among economists. In January, the Wall Street Journal asked over 60 economists how much stimulus is needed. A bit more than half said less than $1 trillion would do. Just under half preferred an amount between $1 trillion and $2 trillion. Now, this was strictly a question about economic stimulus. Bidens plan includes about $160 billion for coronavirus programs, and other pieces might come under the same umbrella. But at some top-line level, economists disagree over the size of the proposal. Jason Furman, chair of the Council of Economic Advisers in the Obama administration, suggested making theBiden plan more flexible. If economic growth remained weak after some initial stimulus, Furman would extend the aid for a longer time. If not, the government could dial back its spending. These provisions could also phase out aid more quickly than Mr. Biden proposes if the economy rebounds faster than expected, Furman wrote Jan. 25, 2021. Samuel Hammond with the Niskanen Center, a group named after an economic adviser to President Ronald Reagan, joined over 120 economists in a letter that called for substantial relief. But Hammond said he agrees with the concerns raised by Summers, and has reservations about a major part of the Biden plan: $350 billion for state and local governments. I think Larry (Summers) has been making some decent points about COVID relief, and the longer-term benefits of prioritizing public investments rather than a ton of state and local fiscal aid, Hammond said. The White House press office staff noted that support has come from top Democratic and Republican economists, and they pointed to statements from leading business groups such as the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the Business Roundtable. But while those statements push for strong action, they are not specific about a dollar figure. We look forward to working with the new administration and Congress on the details and in ensuring that any additional economic assistance is timely, targeted, and temporary,  the Chamber of Commerce said Jan. 14. That leaves plenty of room for discussion about the scale of the relief package. Biden said that economists across the political spectrum supported his COVID-19 relief proposal. There is broad agreement that Washington should spend hundreds of billions of dollars to corral the coronavirus, help small businesses and give assistance to the millions of people who lost their jobs. But Biden treated that support as an endorsement of his entire $1.9 trillion plan. Many prominent economists have concerns about the price tag, which was the exact focus of the question Biden was answering. He glossed over that debate.",0.4,0.6,0.8,0.5,0.2,0.5,0.7,0.9,0.4,Mostly False

Final Rating: Mostly False  ","Of those 850,000 (new Texas) jobs, most were public-sector jobs and minimum-wage jobs.","Gov. Rick Perry frequently crows about the Texas economy, lately saying that in his near-decade as governor, Texas has gained more than 850,000 jobs. In an Oct. 15 interview, Perry's Democratic opponent didn't challenge that number. However, Bill White told the Texas Tribune: Of those 850,000 jobs, most were public-sector jobs and minimum-wage jobs. Huh. We hadn't heard that. Katy Bacon, White's spokeswoman, later said that White thinks that being able to attract high-wage jobs is crucial to the state's long-term economic growth. In 2009, 474,000 Texas workers — 8.5 percent of the hourly work force — earned the federal minimum wage or less, according to a March 11 news release from the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics. That was the highest proportion of low-wage earners in the 50 states and the District of Columbia, the release said. We wondered how many of those jobs were created on Perry's watch, per White's claim that most of the employment gains touted by the governor were jobs that paid minimum wage or were in the public sector. First, some background: The 850,000 figure touted by Perry and dissected by White reflects the net increase in nonfarm jobs in the state from January 2001, soon after Perry became governor, through June 2010 (actual gain = 853,400). However, updated statistics show that through August, the net jobs gained had decreased to 818,500. We also noted that the Texas State Data Center has projected that the Texas population grew by about 4 million between 2001 and 2010. When asked to back up White's breakdown of the job gains, the White campaign provided a spreadsheet of calculations using bureau data to show the rise in both government-sector jobs and minimum-wage jobs in Texas. The campaign looked at several time periods, including the one favored by the Perry campaign, January 2001 to June 2010, and others that incorporated the most recent data available, through August 2010. In an accompanying letter, Tom McCasland, a research analyst for White's campaign, said their calculations showed that government and minimum-wage jobs accounted for 62.8 percent to 69.5 percent of the total job gains. For the time period corresponding to the 850,000 figure (January 2001 to June 2010), the relevant portion of the job gains was 67.5 percent, according to McCasland's information. But in reviewing their math, we found several wrinkles: 1) The bureau's information on public sector and minimum-wage jobs come from different sources that gather data at different time intervals, said Cheryl Abbot, the bureau's regional economist in Dallas. The employment information by sector is compiled monthly while the minimum-wage job situation is examined annually. In this case, that means the time periods for the two categories don't match exactly. 2) Our calculation of the increase in minimum-wage jobs in Texas during Perry's tenure (259,000) didn't match White's (267,000). Why the discrepancy? We used the bureau's most recent information to compare the number of minimum-wage jobs in Texas in 2001 and 2009. McCasland said he had used older bureau information and had compared 2002 with 2009. 3) Another issue: The federal minimum wage increased three times between 2001, when it was $5.15 an hour, and 2010 — rising to $5.85 in 2007, to $6.55 in 2008, and to $7.25 in 2009. These stair-step jumps brought some above-minimum wage jobs down into the minimum-wage-or-below fold. During the years the minimum wage held steady at $5.15 (1998-2006), the number of Texas workers making at or below that amount actually declined slightly, except for a small uptick in 2003. From 2006 to 2009, Abbot said, just over 300,000 more Texans entered that low-paid category. However, we have no way of determining if those are actually 'new jobs' or, more likely, workers whose pay rate is now equal to or below the increased federal minimum wage, she said. That's a fair point, McCasland said. Then he made one of his own: Because Gov. Perry continues to talk about net job creation, it is appropriate to look at how many of those net jobs end up as minimum-wage jobs, either because they were created as such or because they become minimum-wage jobs by failing to keep up with inflation. Lastly, we realized White's calculations assume that government jobs and minimum-wage jobs are entirely separate categories; what if there's overlap and White counted some jobs twice? Abbot told us that's possible but that there's no way to know because the bureau doesn't have data broken down that way. The best I can tell you is that at the national level — which may or may not represent Texas at all — among all hourly-paid public sector workers, 2.3 percent were paid at or below the prevailing minimum wage in 2009, Abbot said. Texas Workforce Commission spokeswoman Ann Hatchitt told us the commission doesn't keep detailed information on minimum-wage workers in Texas, including how many are in the public sector. What we know: Texas added 853,400 jobs from January 2001 through June 2010. Of those, 308,800 were government jobs. That's about 36 percent. To prove White's statement that most (more than 50 percent) of the new jobs were public-sector and minimum wage, an additional 117,901 would have had to be jobs that paid at or below minimum wage. But we can't calculate that because the bureau's count of minimum-wage jobs doesn't discriminate between brand-new jobs and pre-existing ones that were swept into the count when the minimum wage went up. We asked experts including University of Texas economist Daniel Hamermesh and Bruce Kellison, associate director of UT's Bureau of Business Research, whether we could make a ballpark estimate of how many of the job gains under Perry were minimum wage. Each of them said nope, primarily because employment data doesn't break it out. Summing up: White's campaign presented raw numbers suggesting that about two-thirds of the jobs added on Perry's watch were either government-sector or minimum-wage. But that methodology lacks critical information that could easily lead to a different conclusion. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published.

Final Rating: Half True  ","We have a host of issues associated with high B.M.I.s. But correlation doesnt prove causation, and theres a significant body of research showing that weight stigma and weight cycling can explain most if not all of the associations we see between higher weights and poor health outcomes.","In a recent New York Times opinion column, dietitian Christy Harrison, an intuitive eating coach and author, responded to a fellow clinician who had questioned some of her thoughts on the link between being overweight and developing other medical conditions. Harrison noted that although most health professionals have been taught that higher body mass index (BMI) causes poor health outcomes, she wrote, unfortunately, that just isnt true. She added: We have a host of issues associated with high B.M.I.s. But correlation doesnt prove causation, and theres a significant body of research showing that weight stigma and weight cycling can explain most if not all of the associations we see between higher weights and poor health outcomes. We decided to investigate the point she was making, which is at the center of a larger, often-heated debate about whether it is possible to be overweight and healthy at the same time — a perspective advocated by the Health at Every Size movement, of which Harrison is a part. With nearly 72% of U.S. adults considered overweight or obese, this is a pressing issue. When we reached out to Harrison to find out the basis of her statement, she responded quickly, citing two papers as her main sources. The first, a 2011 piece published in the Nutrition Journal, argues it might be better to shift away from weight-loss efforts to improving health in other ways that are weight-neutral. Its lead author, Linda Bacon, a professor at the University of California-Davis, wrote Health at Every Size: The Surprising Truth About Your Weight, a 2010 book embraced by fat acceptance advocates. It addresses Harrisons first point with this: While it is well established that obesity is associated with increased risk for many diseases, causation is less well-established. The other paper, a 2014 piece in the Journal of Obesity, makes similar arguments. Causation, correlation, association: Lets unpack that There is an old saw used by most statisticians: Correlation does not equal causation. But what does that mean? Lets use a fake example: Some people have trouble seeing at night. Turns out all those people ate carrots. Ergo, there could be a correlation between people who ate carrots and those who experienced night vision problems. That doesn't prove anything else, though, such as causation. Correlation is necessary when trying to determine causation, but doesnt prove it. Epidemiological studies never show causation, only association, said Dr. Samuel Klein, director of the Center for Human Nutrition at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis. To establish cause, epidemiologists need more evidence. The best way, considered the gold standard, is to randomly assign people to one group or another ― feeding one group carrots and withholding carrots from the other. Researchers would then monitor any difference in how many people develop night vision problems. Thats nifty, but not always possible or ethical. One could not, for example, randomly assign some people to a group and then cause them to become overweight.  Instead, researchers use different types of studies, such as those that compare groups of people who already have the characteristic — say, carrot eating or being overweight — with those who dont to see if patterns emerge. They use methods to control for things that might affect the results, such as age, gender, income level, whether a person smokes and other factors. Then they can estimate how strong of an association or correlation they see. With smoking and lung cancer, very strong associations were seen, leading to the conclusion that, yes, smoking causes lung cancer. But does excess weight cause other health conditions, such as diabetes, heart disease, cancer, sleep apnea or joint problems? With the case of weight, the associations are much weaker, said Kendrin Sonneville, assistant professor of nutritional sciences at the University of Michigan School of Public Health. So on this point, Hendersons statement holds up. Current scientific research supports a correlation between being overweight and suffering poor health outcomes, but it does not definitively establish causation. But others, especially clinicians, say there is little doubt that being overweight strongly raises the risk of developing such health problems. This isnt up for debate, said Dr. Harold Bays, chief science officer for the Obesity Medicine Association, which represents practitioners who treat overweight patients. The overwhelming amount of clinical and scientific data supports obesity as a disease, both as a direct and indirect contributor to a large number of adverse metabolic and other health consequences, he said. A 2018 Endocrine Society scientific statement, for example, looked across many studies of overweight and obesity, concluding that the two contribute to type 2 diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease, some cancers, kidney disease, obstructive sleep apnea, gout, osteoarthritis, and hepatobiliary disease, among others. Then things get murky. Bays and the other experts agreed that some people who are overweight might not develop other conditions. It is absolutely true that not all cases of diabetes, hypertension, cancer and fatty liver are due to obesity, said Bays. They acknowledged that people who fall into the category of being obese or overweight may even appear healthy metabolically — at least for a while. But theres also a caution. If you say, Wait a minute, is their blood sugar where we want it  arent their triglycerides a little high and what about their blood pressure? And thats not even to mention pain to the joints or sleep apnea, Bays said. When you drill down, very few people would truly meet the criteria of being metabolically healthy but obese, and if you follow them for five or 10 years, now the majority are going to have something. What about stigma? Theres been less research around Harrisons second point: that most, if not all, of the diseases associated with being obese or overweight are caused instead by the stigma heavy people face, or the yo-yo effect of dieting, losing weight and then gaining it back again, in regular cycles. She pointed to research included in the paper by Bacon reporting that weight cycling could lead to hypertension, or high blood pressure. The research, however, found associations though not specific causation. Similarly, in another study Harrison provided, people who reported weight discrimination ― 6% of the sample studied — had twice the risk of physiological stress over nearly 10 years. Such stress can be associated with Type 2 diabetes, hypertension and cardiovascular disease, the study said. But most of those we spoke with strongly disputed the sweeping statement that so many chronic conditions can be caused by stigma and weight cycling. While those two things can factor into health problems, they are not responsible for most of the health outcomes seen by her patients, said Dr. Fatima Cody Stanford, an obesity medicine physician and an assistant professor of medicine and pediatrics at Harvard Medical School. Stanford also takes issue with advocates who promote the idea that being overweight isnt a big health risk factor. The Health at Every Size movement goes against what we know about obesity as a disease, Stanford said. Their aim in that movement is to not learn the science. Our ruling Harrison said the notion that a higher BMI causes poor health outcomes just isnt true ― adding that we have a host of issues associated with high BMIs. But correlation doesnt prove causation, and theres a significant body of research showing that weight stigma and weight cycling can explain most if not all of the associations we see between higher weights and poor health outcomes. On a strict reading of the science, she has a point. It is very difficult to prove definitively what causes disease, and showing correlation is a different finding than causation.However, she appears to apply this standard selectively, using it both to undermine the relationship between high BMI and poor health outcomes, and as evidence of how weight cycling and stigma are linked to certain chronic health conditions. But in the case of obesity, researchers in multiple studies nationally and worldwide have shown definite links between being overweight and developing diseases, such as diabetes, and conditions, such as painful joints. There is far less evidence for the role that weight stigma and yo-yo dieting has in the development of those medical problems, although the experts urge continuing research into those questions.",0.7,0.5,0.9,0.6,0.3,0.4,0.5,0.8,0.5,Half True

Final Rating: Half True  ","Says Every time the Legislature 'suspended' the kicker, most recently the corporate kicker in 2007, Salem spent every penny and failed to stabilize the state's revenues.","Correction appended: An earlier version of this item used the word economy instead of the word revenue. The error does not change the ruling. The states surplus refund law, better known as the kicker, requires a refund to taxpayers if actual revenues exceed projections by at least 2 percent. The idea is to force the state to stick to a budget, but some people argue the law makes it harder to save money for bad economic times.Last month, former state Rep. Brent Barton, a Democrat, argued we should repeal the kicker and build savings in order to improve the states bond rating. In response, current state Rep. Matt Wand, a Republican, argued that Oregon should leave the kicker alone and, instead, require state government to save 1 percent of its general fund dollars if it craves a piggy bank. Repealing the kicker may impress some Wall Street bankers, but it'll do little to stabilize state finances and absolutely nothing to improve our economy and put people back to work, Wand wrote, adding: Every time the Legislature suspended the kicker, most recently the corporate kicker in 2007, Salem spent every penny and failed to stabilize the state's revenues. Every time? PolitiFact Oregon wanted to know how many times the kicker had been tapped, and under what circumstances. As for stabilizing revenues, we wanted to know whether kicker money was meant to do that and in how much time, especially when Oregon relies so heavily on income taxes that go up and down with the economy.The kicker has been suspended three times since the law was approved in 1979. Legislators voted to suspend the law authorizing the personal kicker for tax year 1991 and the corporate kicker for 1993. Both times, they needed to plug financial holes due to lost revenue from 1990s Ballot Measure 5, which curbed property taxes.Measure 5 required state replacement of lost local school revenue at $362 million in 1991-93. That grew to $1.6 billion in 1993-95 budget.Then Salem left the kicker alone, for the most part, until 2007, when the economy was pretty plush. Legislators, with backing from business, voted to start a rainy day fund to shelter the state should the economy sour going forward. They started with a one-time suspension of the corporate kicker, totalling $319 million.But they didnt get a chance to let that kicker money grow. In 2008, the recession hit. Lawmakers withdrew $225 million to balance the 2007-09 budget (which had grown to $338 million, including interest and leftovers from the previous budget period). Then they took $116 million to balance the 2009-11 budget, leaving a paltry $10 million in the pot. (Paul Warner, Oregons legislative revenue officer, said he expects the fund will grow to $46 million for the 2011-13 budget.)So Wands not technically right about spending it all down, but we get what hes saying. In 2007, legislators took the corporate kicker and they used most of it in the following years even while increasing taxes and fees for other state needs. Not very fiscally conscious of Salem.Yet the failed to stabilize the states revenues continued to bug us. Wand dings lawmakers for taking some kicker money -- not all of it, mind you -- in times of emergency, as was the case with Measure 5. Furthermore, he criticizes the Legislature for taking corporate kicker money to start a rainy day fund, only to have the fund brutalized by a recession that continues to hurt. He was leaving out context.After all, the bigger reason for Oregons revenue instability has to do with our heavy reliance on income taxes.The kicker law just exacerbates the swings, say some economists. In a 2009 guest column in The Oregonian, University of Oregon adjunct professor and economist Tim Duy wrote that: (W)e have a ridiculous fiscal system that accentuates the peaks and troughs of the business cycle. When the economy is growing, we return hundreds of millions of dollars to taxpayers, but then find it necessary to raise taxes or reduce spending when recession hits --exactly the opposite of good policy, but the only option available under Oregon's unique kicker law. We need to move forward with the development of a more aggressive rainy day fund. Optimally, but perhaps politically impossible, we would also reform tax policy to reduce dependence on the income tax. We asked Wand what he meant by his statement. Did he blame the states instability on the kicker? Did he think we should never use the kicker? Did he really think the kicker was supposed to stabilize the budget?It turns out he was responding specifically to claims that Democrats have made, that if we suspend Oregons kicker, magically the state budget will be stable and everything will be fine. And nothing could be further from the truth.He said, Im calling foul on the other side for pretending that theyre serious about savings, and my proof of that is look at whats happened in the past when we have suspended the kicker. The unicorns and rainbows have not appeared. (For the record, Wand is not opposed to taking kicker money for savings -- so long as state government also puts aside money every year.) Wand is right that taking away the kicker isnt the only way for state government to save money. Nothing has prevented the state from socking away dollars on its own. But the assertion that suspending the kicker should have stabilized revenues -- but didnt -- is flawed.These examples of when the kicker was spent are not good examples, said Duy, the economist. Ultimately, you'd want to be saving money when the economy is doing well and using that savings when the economy is doing poorly. Its very hard to accomplish the savings when you're in a recession. Its true that the state has suspended the kicker three times, although its not true that the state has spent every penny in those instances. Using the kicker did not stabilize the states budget, but thats largely due to an unreliable revenue base as well as extenuating circumstances: loss of revenue from a ballot measure and a recession.The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.",0.5,0.6,0.8,0.5,0.3,0.4,0.6,0.8,0.4,Half True

Its survey uses slightly different numbers from Blackburns in describing the Manhattan Institutes findings, saying it predicts a loss of 1,000 jobs in Tennessee, which currently employs more than 9,000 workers directly and many more indirectly.Since we know some of those 9,000 jobs are in Johnson City, Chattanooga and and Knoxville and other places outside Blackburns 7th Congressional District, we can begin to quibble with Blackburns suggestion that 10,000 are in her district, which stretches to connect suburban Nashville to suburban Memphis.Figures for 2011 from the Department of Labor and Workforce Development indicate there were 236 medical device manufacturing establishments with 8,871 employees in seven Tennessee counties -- or more than 10 percent fewer than Blackburn claimed were in her own congressional district.Blackburn represents people in parts of two of those counties -- Davidson and Shelby -- and those counties employ 6,044 people, a majority of the jobs in that category. We also know that in Shelby County, a large majority of those jobs have long been located in the mostly urban 9th Congressional District, not the suburban-rural 7th. Three Medtronic and three Smith & Nephew operations all have addresses within the 9th Congressional District.Also worth noting -- because of re-districting, Blackburn will represent neither Shelby nor Davidson next year if shes re-elected.Reynard, her spokesman, said Blackburn didnt mean to say in my congressional district, but rather that she meant state.  However, as of June 15, the video of the statement was still posted by the RepMarshaBlackburn channel on YouTube without any clarification, and other partisan websites were featuring it. PolitiFact policy is to rule on what is said, but to acknowledge when someone admits to a mistake and take that into account when making a ruling.Blackburn does make the point that anything affecting medical device manufacturing could have a significant effect on Tennessee employment -- many of her suburban residents do in fact work for firms like Smith & Nephew and Medtronic -- so lets look at exactly what the Manhattan folks said.The study says Tennessee had 9,179 medical device manufacturing jobs statewide in 2009, nearly 10 percent fewer than Blackburn claimed. It then goes into a discussion from Macroeconomics 101 on the excise taxs anticipated effect on the elasticity of demand for medical devices. It assumes that price-sensitive elasticity would send some manufacturing offshore. It breaks down the number of jobs lost by the effect of the tax on a shift in production offshore of 1 percent, 2 percent, 5 percent, all the way up to 30 percent, where it says as many as 146,218 of the estimated 409,000 jobs nationwide might be lost.Table 11 on page 21 of the report indicates that in Tennessee 1,023 of 9,179 jobs would be lost statewide assuming a 2.3 percent excise tax and a 10 percent shift in production offshore.But is that shift to overseas employment a reasonable assumption?We hear a lot of talk these days about penalizing, not rewarding, companies that use the overseas labor of low-wage countries. To the extent its not just talk, some politicians are seeing that some constituents thought they favored free trade until they saw that free-trade agreements may lower standards of living and manufacturing employment numbers of higher-wage countries.Its safe to say this debate will rage on, but whats less clear is the extent to which health-care spending is sensitive to fluctuations in price. How will those who need a catheter or a stent, or those who manufacture them, respond to the imposition of a 2.3 percent excise tax? If someone needs crutches, is a 2.3 percent rise in price a major consideration? A 2006 study cited by Businessweek in March indicates health-related spending is relatively inelastic: When prices go up, demand falls by only a fraction as much.The same Businessweek article notes that another study, commissioned by the medical device industry trade association AdvaMed, also assumed that American manufacturers would ship 10 percent of jobs overseas in response to the tax. But since the tax applies to all devices -- those made overseas as well as domestic production -- there would be no incentive to move production out of the country, it says, describing a Bloomberg Government analysis. Devices manufactured in the U.S. for sale overseas are exempt from the tax.It also makes the case that the industry trade group underestimated the increased demand for medical devices from the 32 million more people who will be insured under the Affordable Care Act.Our rulingBlackburn exaggerates the number of medical device manufacturing jobs in her district and in the state while citing a free-market advocates 2009 study that says 1,000 jobs could be lost statewide.Some of the assumptions made by The Manhattan Institute study have been questioned, and the provisions of the bill itself mean theres little reason to suspect there would be much off-shoring based on the excise tax. There is also no consensus on how much demand might drop for medical devices produced in Tennessee based on pricing.",0.5,0.7,0.9,0.6,0.4,0.6,0.5,0.8,0.5,Half True

Final Rating: False  ","In Ohio, each year an estimated 1,000 children become victims of human trafficking, and over 3,000 more are at risk.","Despite all the divisiveness in politics, Republicans and Democrats have joined hands to draft legislation on a few things everyone can agree on, like fighting the opioid epidemic, the Zika virus and child sex trafficking. On the latter topic, Democratic U.S. Rep. Joyce Beatty of Ohio held a press conference on May 25, 2016, with Republican co-sponsors of the Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act, calling for its full implementation. In my home state of Ohio, for example, Beatty said, each year an estimated 1,000 children become victims of human trafficking, and over 3,000 more are at risk. Because child-sex-trafficking is an inherently clandestine crime, we were curious about the source of those numbers. The 1,000 children stat appears throughout several Ohio government websites, including the one for the Ohio Human Trafficking Task Force, which Gov. John Kasich first convened in 2012. The home page links to the task forces most recent report, from 2015, and it does not line up with the annual estimate. The report says 181 potential victims of trafficking were identified statewide in 2014 after almost 100 stings to bust sex traffickers — and this tally is not limited just to children. The task forces website also runs a banner that encourages anyone with a tip on a suspected human trafficking case to call the National Human Trafficking Hotline Resource Center, which answers calls 24/7. The resource center, which is partly funded by the U.S. Health and Human Services Department, keeps state-by-state reports online. According to the statistics for Ohio, between December 2007 and March 2016, there were 753 cases with high indicators of human trafficking. Thats almost 10 years of data collection that, combined, doesnt come close to the estimate of 1,000 children annually. Whats going on? The 1,000-victim figure comes from a questionable study commissioned by the Ohio Attorney Generals Office and published in 2010. The members of the study included researchers from the University of Ohio and Toledo University, members of law enforcement, and nonprofit advocates. The commission started with data from an FBI program called Operation Innocence Lost, which focused on 14 cities with the highest incidences of prostitution, which included Toledo, Ohio. The authorities identified an average of 15 minor victims of sex trafficking in Toledo each year, between 2005 and 2009. The studys authors took that 15-per-year figure and applied it to all girls ages 12 through 17 in the state of Ohio. That population, 337,961, yields an estimate of 202 girls per year. Then, the commission multiplied 202 by five, because a University of Toledo study claimed that each sex trafficking victim they interviewed knew an average of five more underaged minors not known to law enforcement, but who were engaging in the sex trade. One big problem: The Ohio study did not control for the fact that Toledos child sex trafficking rates were the highest in the state, which inflates their estimate even before multiplying it by five. The commission then threw in some boys for good measure, reasoning that being gay, transgender or a runaway are risk factors for becoming a child sex trafficking victim. Because 3 to 5 percent of the overall US population identifies as gay, lesbian, bisexual or transgender, the committee added 63 males to the estimated number of child victims. The attorney generals trafficking study concluded that an annual 1,078 minors in Ohio were potential victims. The other number Beatty and other state leaders cite repeatedly is that there are 3,000 children at risk of being trafficked. For that, the attorney generals commission relied on a studyby University of Pennsylvania researchers Richard J. Estes and Neil Alan Weiner, who came up with 14 factors that purportedly increased the chances of a teen being forced into the sex trade. But the Washington Post and Village Voice are among many sources that have thoroughly debunked the Estes and Weiner study. Estes eventually admitted to reporters, Kids who are kidnapped and sold into slavery — that number would be very small. Were talking about a few hundred people. David Finkelhor, a respected voice in his rolewith the Crimes Against Children Research Center at the University of New Hampshire, has previously criticized the methodology used in the 2010 Ohio study. He told PolitiFact via email,Nothing has appeared in the last couple of years to make estimates of the problem any more scientific than they were 10 years ago.  Through a spokesperson, Beatty agreed that the estimate is bunk. Congresswoman Beatty was comfortable using the estimates because they were calculated by the Ohio Attorney Generals Office, in consultation with the University of Toledo, and based on research and observations from experts in the field, spokesman Dominic Manecke wrote in an email. However, she has no problem conceding that the estimate may need to be updated, because whether it be one person, 100 or 1,000 people, one trafficking victim is one too many. Elizabeth Ranade Janis, the head of Kasichs Human Trafficking Task Force, told PolitiFact that the 1,000-child-victim talking point lacks a basis in solid statistics. Its definitely an estimate, she said. There is no question whether human trafficking is a crime that occurs in our state. ... I would gladly welcome more research to help us better understand the prevalence of the crime and strengthen our efforts to assist survivors. Celia Williamson, who served as the sub-committee chairperson on the 2010 study commission, stood by their estimate, with a caveat. I think you have to look at 2009 and the data we had at the time, Williamson said. Toledo was the only city in Ohio with a task force on human trafficking at the time. It was the central place to start. Someone has to pioneer and begin. Our ruling Beatty said, Each year an estimated 1,000 children become victims of human trafficking, and over 3,000 more are at risk. The underlying study behind this widely distributed state talking point lacks scientific footing. Law enforcement totals of cases involving sex trafficking victims did not approach anywhere close to 1,000 child victims. Its impossible to quantify how many go undiscovered. But artificially inflating that estimate isnt necessary. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/a0e109ab-8e1f-4e19-a85c-d5bdbfbee89f",0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,False

Final Rating: Mostly False  ",COVID cases in India plummet after government promotes ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine use.,"On May 17, the New York Times reported that the coronavirus crisis was so severe in India, with about 23 million infections confirmed, that the country was accounting for more than half of the worlds daily COVID-19 cases. The same day, The Gateway Pundit posted a story suggesting that two drugs — both of which have drawn warnings from U.S. and global public health officials not to be used for COVID-19 — were having dramatic effects in India. The headline, widely shared on Facebook, read: Elites Worried: COVID Cases in India Plummet After Government Promotes Ivermectin and Hydroxychloroquine Use. The post was flagged as part of Facebooks efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Daily COVID-19 cases in India decreased in the days before May 17 — but only after a nearly vertical rise that started in April and peaked May 8. The Indian government has recommended limited use of the two drugs for COVID-19, but there is no evidence that their use led to the drop in cases. Neither drug is approved in the U.S. for COVID-19. And both the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and the World Health Organization recommend against using them to prevent or to treat COVID-19 infection. The Gateway Pundit article was written by the sites founder and editor-in-chief, Jim Hoft, whose Twitter account was permanently suspended in February for repeated violations of Twitters policies on election-related messages, according to news reports. The Gateway Pundit article links to another article that links to revised guidelines issued April 28 by Indias Ministry of Health & Family Welfare. The guidelines, for home isolation of mild/asymptomatic COVID-19 cases, recommends considering ivermectin as treatment for those patients, and says people in close contact with those patients should take hydroxychloroquine as a prevention as per protocol and as prescribed by the treating medical officer. Hoft did not respond to a request for evidence to support his claim. Confirmed new COVID-19 cases in India declined in the days before the article was posted, based on a seven-day rolling average — but only after reaching a peak following a sharp increase that started in April. The seven-day average of new daily cases was 319,497 on May 17, the date of the post, down from a peak of 391,232 on May 8, according to Our World in Data. The U.S. average was 32,036 on May 17. Many experts caution that the Indian governments official tallies of confirmed cases likely vastly underestimate the actual infection figures because testing remains limited and the volume of cases has crippled the health care system in some areas. So the actual extent of the decline is not clear. Hydroxychloroquine and ivermectin are being widely used in India for COVID-19, according to news reports. But there is no evidence they led to the recent decline in confirmed cases, given the lack of clear scientific evidence that they are effective at all in prevention or treatment. The governments new guidelines dont give a rationale for the recommendations. They were issued several days after a research paper was published that said results from numerous controlled prophylaxis trials, including some done in India, report significantly reduced risks of contracting COVID-19 with the regular use of ivermectin. Doctors in India admitted to have prescribed the drug under compulsion, peer pressure or on patients demand, according to one news report . The health minister in Goa was quoted as saying ivermectin does not prevent a COVID-19 infection, but helps in reducing the severity of the disease. Hydroxychloroquine has been in use much longer. In June 2020, a task force of Indias health ministry recommended that frontline health care workers take it to prevent COVID-19 infection. According to the journal Nature, the task force cited three new studies conducted by government agencies, only one of which had been published, that the task force said showed it can prevent infection. Leading U.S. and global health authorities recommend against using the two drugs for COVID-19. In March 2020, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration authorized emergency use of hydroxychloroquine, which is FDA-approved to treat or prevent malaria, for certain hospitalized COVID-19 patients. But the FDA revoked its authorization less than three months later, after determining it is no longer reasonable to believe that it may be effective in treating COVID-19, nor is it reasonable to believe that the known and potential benefits of these products outweigh their known and potential risks. The FDA continues to recommend against using it for COVID-19. In guidelines issued March 2 on drugs to prevent COVID-19, the World Health Organization said: We recommend against administering hydroxychloroquine prophylaxis to individuals who do not have COVID-19 — strong recommendation, high certainty evidence. And in guidelines issued March 31 on treating COVID-19, the organization gave a strong recommendation against hydroxychloroquine in patients with COVID-19 of any severity. In the treatment guidelines, the World Health Organization said: We recommend not to use ivermectin in patients with COVID-19 except in the context of a clinical trial, citing very low certainty evidence about the drug. The FDA, in an article March 5, said ivermectin should not be used to prevent or treat COVID-19. Ivermectin, which is FDA-approved to treat conditions caused by parasitic worms and parasites such as lice, in large doses is dangerous and can cause serious harm. An FDA posting April 26 noted that a June 2020 research article described the effect of ivermectin on the coronavirus in a laboratory setting, but that more testing is needed to determine whether ivermectin might be appropriate to prevent or treat coronavirus or COVID-19. Some limited studies suggest that ivermectin can help treat COVID-19; others show no significant impact. Many of the studies had small sample sizes and other limitations. It would therefore be premature to conclude absolutely that ivermectin has no place in COVID-19 treatment, Gordon Dent, a senior lecturer in pharmacology at Keele University School of Medicine in England, wrote in April. On the basis of current evidence, however, its use cannot be recommended. The Gateway Pundit claimed: COVID cases in India plummet after government promotes ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine use. COVID-19 cases in India, one of the worst-hit countries in the world by the coronavirus, dropped in mid-May only after a nearly vertical spike in cases over the previous several weeks. The Indian government has given limited recommendations for using the two drugs in connection with mild COVID-19 cases. There is no evidence that the two drugs caused or contributed to a decline in cases in India. Neither is approved in the U.S. for COVID-19. And both the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and the World Health Organization recommend against using them to prevent or to treat COVID-19 infections, citing lack of scientific evidence of their effectiveness and the potential for serious side effects.

Final Rating: Mostly False",New Zealand okays euthanasia for COVID patients.,"As COVID-19 cases continue to surge, the headline on a blog post claims New Zealand decided to approve euthanasia for COVID-19 patients. New Zealand okays euthanasia for COVID patients, reads the blogs headline, which was shared in numerous social media posts. Patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19 can die by euthanasia if doctors decide they might not survive, the New Zealand government has declared, said one tweet that drew a quote from the Catholic Herald article before offering commentary: Thatll certainly increase the numbers. Theres evil afoot. “Patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19 can die by euthanasia if doctors decide they might not survive, the New Zealand government has declared.”Thatll certainly increase the numbers.Theres evil afoot. https://t.co/ffGi5egSpL But the headline is a misrepresentation of an assisted dying program that recently went into effect in New Zealand — and social media posts referencing the news leave out significant context. Passed in a referendum by New Zealanders in 2020, the End of Life Choice Act of 2019 has strict eligibility requirements and is only meant for terminally ill people. It wasnt introduced for COVID-19 patients. The story was flagged as part of Facebooks efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more aboutour partnership with Facebook.) The law took effect in November 2021 about a year after the vote. In December, an anti-euthansia website called The Defender published an article that seemed to ignite the claims now circulating online. According to the article, the New Zealand Health Ministry told The Defender that, in some circumstances, a person with COVID-19 may be eligible for assisted dying, and suggested that the law could be used as a tool if COVID-19 hospitalizations were to spiral out of control. But New Zealand health officials said that the story and others like it are taking the law out of context and omitting its eligibility requirements and rules. There is no truth to claims that suggest the law was introduced for COVID-19, said Blair Cunningham, a spokesperson for the health agency. To be eligible for the program, a person must be 18 years or older and meet all of the following criteria: a citizen or permanent resident of New Zealand suffering from a terminal illness that is likely to end their life within six months in an advanced state of irreversible decline in physical capability experiencing unbearable suffering that cannot be relieved in a manner that the person considers tolerable competent to make an informed decision about assisted dying. Two doctors and, in some cases, a psychiatrist must assess whether a patient is eligible and whether the person is competent to make an informed decision. The legislation says that doctors cant suggest euthanasia as an option to the patient or make the decision for them. The patient alone must be the one to raise assisted dying with someone in their health care team. The services, Cunningham said, are most likely to be provided in a persons home or other community settings, rather than in hospital settings. The health agency added that a terminal illness is most often a prolonged disease where treatment is not effective and that, in some circumstances, a person with COVID-19 may be eligible for assisted dying. But because eligibility is determined case by case, the agency cannot make definitive statements about who is eligible. Blog posts and social media posts claim that New Zealand has approved euthansia for COVID-19 patients, with suggestions that it could be used as a tool if COVID-19 hospitalizations rise dramatically. An assisted-dying law was passed by New Zealand voters in 2020. But while some COVID-19 patients may be eligible under the law, the legislation was not introduced for COVID-19. The law has strict eligibility requirements, including that the person must have a terminal illness that is likely to end their life within six months and causes them unbearable suffering. It requires multiple doctors to determine whether the person is eligible and competent, and doctors cannot suggest euthanasia as an option or make the decision for patients. These stories are misleading and omit critical facts that would give a different impression. Mostly False.",0,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,Mostly False

Final Rating: Mostly False  ","We would create thousands of jobs in Colorado, if the Keystone Pipeline were to be built.","President Barack Obamas indefinite delay of the Keystone XL pipeline has become a wedge issue between Democrats and Republicans as the midterm election season heats up. In the Colorado Senate race, Democratic Sen. Mark Udall recently voted against Congress fast-tracking the pipeline, but said the administrations review process should continue. His likely Republican opponent, U.S. Rep. Cory Gardner, has called for swift approval, insisting it would be an economic boon to the state. In an interview on Univision Radio, a primarily Spanish-language station, Gardner accused Senate Democrats of holding up the pipeline to placate environmentalists in an election year. The Keystone Pipeline would create good-paying jobs, Gardner said. Not only where the pipeline is being built, good-paying construction jobs, but manufacturing and service opportunities in Colorado along with the Keystone Pipeline. We would create thousands of jobs in Colorado, if the Keystone Pipeline were to be built. The planned route for the pipeline, which would connect diluted oil sands from Western Canada to Nebraska and then Gulf Coast refineries, doesnt go through Colorado. So we wondered if it was possible that thousands of jobs would be created by the pipeline there. We asked Gardners staff for the source of his claim. Spokesman Alex Siciliano pointed us to the written testimony of Gary Mar, who represented Alberta, Canada, in Washington and spoke at a House Energy and Commerce committee hearing in February 2011. Mar cites a 2009 study from the Canadian Energy Research Institute that estimates over 15 years the development of Albertas oil sands will boost U.S. GDP by an average of $31 billion per year, creating over 624,000 jobs in the U.S. We couldnt find the original study, but a chart Mar appended to his testimony says Colorado would see 11,200 jobs between 2009 and 2025, about half of which would have come between 2011 and 2015. The chart, however, looks at the economic impact of the entire Alberta oil sands on the United States, not just the Keystone XL pipeline. In a subsequent 2011 study, the Canadian Energy Research Institute claimed job growth as a result of the oil sands could reach 600,000 in the United States, but only if existing pipelines were expanded and other projects came to fruition. A spokeswoman for the Canadian Energy Research Institute also said those numbers did not look at the economic benefits of the pipeline, but only the benefits from upstream production of oil sands. Basically, its not measuring the benefit from the pipeline itself, rather the study estimates the effects of Canada being able to increase its capacity to produce oil. The study Siciliano showed us is also from 2009. As TransCanada, the company building the pipeline, told us previously, The project has changed considerably since then, including substantial route changes and a new presidential permit application. TransCanada has stopped touting its own study on the the economic benefits of the pipeline from from the same time period, which estimated about 20,000 manufacturing and construction jobs, and another 118,000 spin-off jobs. Instead, in an email to PolitiFact this week, TransCanada pointed us to the State Departments analysis of the project. According to that study, the Keystone XL pipeline would directly create the equivalent of 16,100 jobs if the project took one year. If the job lasted two years, the equivalent of 8,050 people would be employed over the course of the project. Of those jobs, 5,400 would be in states where the pipeline and support infrastructure will actually get built — Montana, South Dakota, Nebraska and Kansas. The rest of those direct jobs would be created in other states. In all, about 42,100 jobs would be created over the course of the project — 30,000 of which would be outside the aforementioned four states. This includes jobs created directly by the pipeline (like the construction work), indirectly (like jobs created as a result of goods and services purchased by construction crews) and induced (jobs created by workers spending their wages in the economy). How many of those 30,000 temporary jobs would be in Colorado? Its not clear from the State Department study, and a spokeswoman for the department said it wasnt available. Ian Goodman, who co-authored a Cornell University study of the pipeline, said its unlikely that Colorados chunk of those 30,000 jobs would reach the thousands. Though Colorado could see some benefits from being in a state proximate to the pipeline, it is not expected to be a major supplier to the construction. Most of these jobs would be in the states along the pipeline routing and most of the remainder would be in states heavily involved in the spin offs — pipeline supply chain and/or providing goods and services for Keystone XL workers, Goodman said. Colorado is not likely to have a big roles in these spin-offs. So it is hard to see how Colorado could be getting thousands of jobs from Keystone XL. Goodman also said TransCanada has already spent about one-third of the pipeline's budget on engineering, design, permitting, and equipment and materials already procured and manufactured. That means that some jobs and economic development from that part of the project have already been realized. In a rosy scenario, Goodman estimated that at most 1,400 additional jobs could be created in Colorado, but more likely it will be less, perhaps closer to 500. As weve noted in the past, too, almost all of these jobs are not permanent, as is often the case with construction projects. The State Department found the pipeline would create 35 permanent jobs and 15 temporary jobs once it went into operation. Our ruling Gardner said, We would create thousands of jobs in Colorado, if the Keystone Pipeline were to be built. Gardner based that statement off an old study that measured the overall impact of the Alberta oil sands on the U.S. economy, not the Keystone XL pipeline specifically. The State Department study cited by the company building the pipeline estimates that the equivalent of 30,000 direct, indirect and induced temporary jobs will be created in states outside the pipelines projected route. However, it doesnt specify how many of those would be created in Colorado.",0.3,0.7,0.9,0.4,0.2,0.5,0.6,0.5,0.3,Mostly False

Final Rating: Half True  ",Says a voter-adopted constitutional amendment instructed a state board headed by Jerry Patterson to put $300 million in investment earnings into a fund supporting public school operations.,"In a recent newsletter update, a Democratic-leaning group touted its campaign to sway a board headed by a Republican to dispatch $300 million to a fund that supports public school operations.Progress Texas maintains that Texas Land Commissioner Jerry Patterson is hoarding investment earnings despite a 2011 constitutional amendment intended to ease the flow of money to the Available School Fund, which helps pay for classroom instructional materials and technology.The groups Sept. 7, 2012, email update says: Proposition 6 instructed the three-person School Land Board, run by Chairman Jerry Patterson as part of the General Land Office, to put a portion of earnings -- $300 million, to be precise -- from investments on real estate assets into the Available School Fund as a way to soften the blow of $5.4 billion in cuts to public education.Patterson brought the update to our attention. We decided to check it out.For nearly a decade, the land office has invested in real estate using proceeds received from selling land or drawing on revenue from mineral leases and royalties associated with the states education endowment, the Permanent School Fund, the agency notes on a web page. In turn, the land board, consisting of the land commissioner and two citizen appointees, manages the sale of Permanent School Fund land and mineral leases.In 2011, the board voted to release $250 million in earnings on investments in both 2012 and 2013 for school needs, as we noted in another fact check. The panel has yet to approve additional transfers to the school fund.So, did the 2011 amendment instruct the board to dispatch precisely $300 million in investment earnings to the Available School Fund?Not quite. The ballot language itself did not mention a dollar figure, while the amendment -- the language added to the constitution -- presented $300 million as the maximum amount that could be annually transferred.As described in a voter guide prepared by the League of Women Voters of the Austin Area, published in the Oct. 23, 2011, Austin American-Statesman, Proposition 6 on the November 2011 ballot permitted up to $300 million of revenues to be transferred to the school fund. Among other observers, the Texas Tribune and San Antonio Express-News each reported that as much as $300 million -- though not necessarily $300 million -- would be allowed to be transferred.However, the 2011 Legislature wrote the 2012-13 state budget including a provision for $150 million a year in such transfers, as noted in a July 25, 2012, Tribune news article pointing out the land board had not initiated a transfer at its latest meeting.Patterson has said the board has through August 2013, the end of the current fiscal year, to decide. He maintains that calls for him to shift earnings must be weighed against the long-term value of simply investing returns.The Tribune story quotes state Rep. Rob Orr, author of the constitutional amendment, as saying: I was told that there would be $300 million going into the Available School Fund. Everything was put in place to allow to that to happen.The story also quotes Orr as saying the land office agreed to transfer the money if the amendment won voter approval. But the story quotes Patterson as saying he did not recall committing to a transfer of the money and that his office had been unable to find any evidence or documents or memos or testimony that he did.In a telephone interview, Orr, R-Burleson, said the amendment did not mandate a transfer amount after Patterson objected to an early version setting a minimum transfer level. Orr told us the amendment also did not instruct the board to transfer funds; it permitted or allowed such action.Regardless, Orr told us, legislative colleagues who drafted the state budget would not put $300 million into a budget that they didnt think they were getting.In emails, the executive director of Progress Texas, Matt Glazer, agreed it is up to the land board to approve transfers. Glazer said its update says the amendment instructed the board to act in the spirit of indicating guidance -- not an order. He pointed out Merriam-Websters definition of instruct, which leads off with to give knowledge to; to provide with authoritative information or advice. The next listed definition: to give an order or command.Reminded that the amendment says the amount transferred is not to exceed $300 million each year, rather than saying precisely $300 million, Glazer said the groups claim reflects the state budget.The relevant budgetary provision provides for $150 million a year to be transferred to support the schools. But the stipulation, adopted before voters considered the proposition, also makes the transfers contingent on voter approval of the amendment as well as the land office moving to make the transfers. If either action doesnt occur, the provision says, budgeted school aid is to be reduced accordingly.Our rulingThe newsletter update said a 2011 constitutional amendment approved by Texas voters instructed a board headed by Patterson to put $300 million into a fund supporting public school operations.This claim distorts aspects of the amendment. First, the word instructed is misleading; the amendment only authorized such transfers. Second, the amendment did not specify that $300 million be dispatched. Thats the maximum annual amount allowed to be transferred.Finally, while lawmakers budgeted the cited $300 million in transfers during 2012-13, they also signed off on a reduction in budgeted school aid if the land office does not make the transfers -- signaling the result was out of their control.This statement has an element of truth.",0.5,0.7,0.8,0.6,0,0.5,0.3,0.5,0.4,Half True

Final Rating: Half True  ","With 320,000 net Ohio manufacturing jobs lost, (Sen. Rob) Portman calls NAFTA a proven success.","Ohio voters may have a sense of deja vu with some of the talking points rolled out by Ohio Senate candidate Ted Strickland. Strickland, the former Democratic governor, is again knocking opponents over job losses from the North American Free Trade Agreement. In aFacebook postabout skewed priorities, Strickland attacks Ohio Sen. Rob Portman, a Republican, for embracing the agreement as U.S. trade representative under President George W. Bush while criticizing the auto bailout. With 320,000 net Ohio manufacturing jobs lost, Portman calls NAFTA a proven success,  the post says. With 160,000 auto jobs saved, Portman called the auto rescue a lousy deal.   The attack about lost jobs from NAFTA sounded a lot likean attack PolitiFact Ohiochecked out in the 2010 governors race against Republican John Kasich. Stricklands campaign blamed NAFTA for a loss of 49,000 jobs to Mexico and 91,000 to China. (Kasich, of course, won the gubernatorial election and is now running for president. And Stricklands claim ratedFalse.) We wanted to know if NAFTA really killed a net 320,000 Ohio manufacturing jobs. NAFTA took effect Jan. 1, 1994, with the intent to smooth importing and exporting between Canada, the United States and Mexico. The deal is a big issue in Ohio, home to unions that are typically among NAFTAs fiercest critics. Unions argue that trade deals like NAFTA send American jobs overseas. Portman indeed called NAFTA a proven success when he was the U.S. trade representative under President George W. Bush in a 2006 newsrelease. The news release didnt say anything about lost jobs, though, so we kept digging.  Strickland campaign spokesman David Bergstein confirmed that they sourced their data from the Washington-based think tankPublic Citizen, founded by activist and former presidential candidate Ralph Nader.The data behind their findings, accessed Aug. 11, 2015, come partly from another left-leaning think tank, theEconomic Policy Institute, and the nonpartisan, federalBureau of Labor Statistics. In the report, Public Citizen claims, Ohio has endured a net loss of more than 323,000 manufacturing jobs – one out of every three – since the 1994 NAFTA and the World Trade Organization agreements took effect. (The group has since reduced the figure of 323,000 jobs lost to 307,000in a revised version.) But then, the report acknowledges that only some of those lost jobs are directly tied to overseas trade. More than 139,000 specific Ohio jobs have been certified under the Trade Adjustment Assistance (TAA) program as lost to offshoring or imports since NAFTA, the report says. The Trade Adjustment Assistance program, part of the Department of Labor, provides federal aid to manufacturers who can prove that they lost revenue due to import policies like NAFTA. Subtracting the TAA-certified number of net jobs lost due to trade agreements -- 139,000 -- from the original figure of 323,000 jobs, leaves 184,000 jobs that were lost for reasons the report doesnt, or cant, explain. In fact, one of the sources cited in the Public Citizen report, the BLS, reports that in the first quarter of 2004, 10 years after NAFTA went into effect, just 4,633 of 239,361 private sector non-farm layoffs can be associated with movement of work outside of the country. Economists say that other factors – say, a global economic downturn rivaling the Great Depression – also contribute to job losses. Ohios dip in employment was part of a nationwide trend from 2008 to 2011, when unemployment doubled from 5 to 10 percent. Tom Sutton, political science professor at Baldwin Wallace University, says that Wall Street has much more to do with the recession and associated job losses than NAFTA. Unemployment surged largely due to the collapse of financial markets following the failure of risky bundled mortgage investments. Economists have also noted that shifts in employment in sectors like manufacturing or agriculture could also be attributed to technological breakthroughs that created jobs in some sectors and cost jobs in others, like when machines replace humans on the assembly line. In other words, the effects of NAFTA cant be measured without considering all the other forces pushing and pulling the states economy. So noted the Congressional Research Service in its 2004 report aboutNAFTA 10 years out, which concludes, NAFTA had little or no impact on aggregate employment. Our ruling Strickland said, With 320,000 net Ohio manufacturing jobs lost, Portman calls NAFTA a proven success.  The implication that NAFTA is solely responsible is a gross oversimplification of a very complex economic phenomenon. Just as one politicians four-year term cant be the sole cause of over a quarter-million lost jobs, the NAFTA trade deal isnt wholly to blame either.",0.5,0.5,1,0.5,0,0.5,0.5,1,0.5,Half True

Final Rating: Half True  ",I was the deciding vote on abolishing the death penalty in the state of Illinois.,"In the crowded race for Chicagos next mayor, many of the would-be candidates are working to distinguish themselves by touting their progressive bona fides — or questioning those of their opponents. During a recent forum featuring five of those vying for the post, Illinois Comptroller Susana Mendoza was called on to defend her criminal justice record by one of her opponents, Cook County Board President Toni Preckwinkle. Mendoza was once a Democratic member of the Illinois House, where she honed a tough-on-crime reputation and had long supported the death penalty even as a succession of Illinois governors imposed a moratorium on the practice. Given that background, Preckwinkle asked Mendoza to explain how voters could trust her as mayor to push for criminal justice reforms. In response, Mendoza spoke of how her views on capital punishment had evolved. I know what its like to be on the other side of crime, said Mendoza, who earlier in the debate had recalled how her family moved from Chicago's Little Village neighborhood when she was a child to escape violence. Having said that, yes I did support the death penalty. But I was the deciding vote on abolishing the death penalty in the state of Illinois. It would still be there had I not voted to abolish it. The 2011 House vote to abolish executions in Illinois succeeded with the minimum number of 60 needed to pass. So, technically, any of those lawmakers who voted for the measure could lay claim to be a deciding vote. But did it really all come down to Mendoza? During debate on the House floor, Mendoza gave an impassioned speech describing how she had personally wrestled with the issue, legislative transcripts show. Throughout my entire life, Ive been a staunch supporter of the death penalty and a firm believer in the justice it serves, Mendoza said on the House floor. But this debate for me is no longer about whether or not guilty killers deserve to die for their crimes, she added, describing how she had met with several former death row inmates in Illinois who had been wrongly convicted and then freed. Speaking to them and hearing their horror stories of being hours away from execution made me reflect on my own beliefs regarding our ability to apply the death penalty in a fair and error free way. Even with Mendozas support, however, the initial House vote on the measure was 59 to 58, one short of the 60-vote majority needed for passage. But the sponsor, then state Rep. Karen Yarbrough of Maywood, used a procedural move to allow for a second vote and then twisted the arm of a Quad Cities area Democrat to switch positions. Id been back and forth on this since they started talking about abolishing it, then state Rep. Patrick Verschoore of Milan told the Bloomington Pantagraph in 2011 after the final vote. He said Yarbrough, who is now the Cook County Recorder of Deeds, called in a favor because she had supported him on other legislation. In light of this, we asked the Mendoza campaign to tell us how Mendoza could be considered the deciding vote on the measure. Spokeswoman Rebecca Evans emailed us a response that did not directly address the question. As is common during the legislative process, not everyone was accounted for during the initial vote for a variety of reasons, Evans wrote. The law to abolish the death penalty would not have passed without Susana's vote. While defending her criminal justice record, Mendoza said she was the deciding vote on abolishing the death penalty in the state of Illinois. Before making that claim, she accurately described her change of heart on the issue that led her to support the 2011 abolition measure after long backing capital punishment. And Mendoza is technically correct that the measure would have sunk had she voted the other way. By that standard, however, any one of the 59 other House members who supported the bill on final passage could make the same claim.  Even with Mendozas support, the measure came up short on an initial vote. When the sponsor opted for a re-do later that day, a different lawmaker whod opposed it on the first try switched his vote, securing its passage. In the end, it clearly didnt come down to Mendoza.",0.5,0.5,1,0.5,0,0.5,0.5,1,0.5,Half True

Final Rating: Mostly False  ",Obama voted for tax subsidies and giveways that have slowed oil companies from pursuing clean energy sources.,"At a rally in Harrisburg, Pa., on March 11, 2008, Sen. Hillary Clinton once again took on Sen. Barack Obama for supporting a 2005 energy bill. In 2005, when we had a chance to say no to Dick Cheney and his energy bill, my opponent said yes and voted for it with all of those tax subsidies and giveaways that have been used by the oil companies and others to retard the development of clean, renewable energy, Clinton said. When it counted, I said no, he said yes. Clinton, along with 25 other senators, including 19 Democrats, voted against the bill, which generally reflected the Bush administration's priorities. Obama and 73 Senate colleagues, including a total of 25 Democrats, supported the bill. Obama said the energy bill would help Illinois and promote greater energy independence by doubling ethanol use, spurring investment in hybrid and flexible-fuel vehicles and promoting clean-coal technology. But he said bolder action would have to be taken to rein in high energy costs. This bill, while far from a solution, is a first step toward decreasing America's dependence on foreign oil, Obama said at the time. Clinton has made much of her opposition to the bill in her campaign — for example, characterizing the legislation during a Jan. 15, 2008, Democratic debate in Las Vegas as a big step backward on the path to clean, renewable energy.Our examination of that claim found it to be false. This time, while Clinton rightly points out that the legislation included tax breaks for oil companies — $2.6-billion to be exact — those were largely wiped out by a $3-billion extension of taxes on crude oil to help offset costs associated with oil spills. The bulk of the $14.6-billion in tax incentives included in the legislation actually went to renewable sources of energy, to accelerate the development of wind, clean-coal and nuclear power, and hybrid vehicles. (Although there is debate over whether coal and nuclear power should be considered renewable.) The bill also included a mandate to produce more alternative fuel, requiring 7.5-billion gallons of ethanol — instead of petroleum-derived methyl tertiary butyl ether, or MTBE — to be blended into gasoline by 2012. The industry is on pace to meet that target ahead of schedule, despite Clinton's claims that oil industry tax breaks have been used to retard development of renewable energy. Responding to a PolitiFact inquiry, the Clinton campaign referred to a speech she made on the Senate floor, citing her opposition to the bill because, in part, it ignored pressing energy challenges, including U.S. dependence on foreign oil. The bill includes billions in subsidies for mature energy industries, including oil and nuclear, Clinton said in her July 29, 2005, remarks. However, this reasoning ignores the fact that tax breaks for oil and gas producers encourage domestic production, which helps reduce reliance on foreign oil. Clinton is right that Obama voted for the bill and she didn't. But because she incorrectly depicts the 2005 energy bill as a setback to renewable energy and a sop to Big Oil, we find her statement to be Barely True.

Final Rating: Mostly True  ","Thanks to (North Carolinas) governor and the legislature, the average teachersalary can barely support a family.","In a speech in Raleigh on Wednesday, Hillary Clinton laid out her plan for improving the economy and reducing income inequality. But she segued into local politics, too, seeking to boost the campaigns of North Carolina Democrats like Roy Cooper, who is running for governor against Republican incumbent Pat McCrory. Teacher pay was her weapon of choice for hitting the states Republican leaders. Clinton was introduced at her rally by a Durham teacher and by former Gov. Jim Hunt, a Democrat known for his education initiatives. You know, for many years, thanks to people and leaders like Jim Hunt, North Carolina was a leading state when it came to education, Clinton said. Now, unfortunately, thanks to your governor and the legislature, the average teacher salary can barely support a family. There are two things here that made our ears perk up. Can the average teacher barely support a family on his or her salary? And if not, is it the fault of McCrory and the states Republican-controlled legislature? How much teachers make The average North Carolina public school teacher made $47,819 in 2014-15 according to the National Education Association, an advocacy group. Both the NEA and the N.C. Department of Public Instruction have estimated the average teacher this school year is making just shy of $48,000. Thats the equivalent of slightly more than $23 per hour when adjusted to 40 hours a week, 52 weeks a year. Thats not the schedule teachers work, but well use it for the sake of comparison since its what most people are familiar with. North Carolinas cost of living What does it mean to be barely able to support a family? Clintons campaign didnt respond on the record, but there are a few ways of looking at it. The average teachers salary is more than triple the minimum wage. Its also enough to keep a family of nine out of poverty. For a more traditional family of four, its about double the poverty level. But the governments poverty guidelines have faced criticism for being outdated and/or inaccurate. So what about other ways of measuring ways to support a family? MIT professor Amy Glasmeier created something called the Living Wage Calculator. It takes local-level data on taxes, rent, transportation, food, child care and other costs into account. The formula also assumes non-working adults are providing full-time child care. Glasmeier has written that it shows the minimum level of income required for individuals and families to pay for basic living expenses – a pretty good approximation of what Clinton was talking about. A single parent making the average teachers salary could support one child but would struggle to support two children, according to the living wage calculations. Likewise, if the teacher is married with a child, an average salary could easily support the child and a stay-at-home spouse. The salary would still be considered a living wage even if that couple had a second child – here it gets to the level of barely enough – but not if they had a third child and the spouse remained unemployed. But we didnt want to just take a calculators word for it. So we asked a professor who studies poverty and politics, Duke Universitys Anirudh Krishna. He agreed that a teachers salary can provide for a familys basic needs but not much more. An annual salary of $48,000 is less than what typically makes for significant intergenerational upward mobility, Krishna said. Rents or mortgages usually make up for half of that amount, and food and fuel account for much of the rest, leaving relatively little for a rainy day, far less for a childs college education. So this part of Clintons claim could be accurate or not, depending on how big the family in question is and what you consider to be barely supporting that family – whether its simply keeping the children out of poverty or being able to do more. But is Clinton right to pin the blame on Republicans for not giving teachers even higher salaries? Political blame Since 2010, the average teacher has earned right around the states median household income. Republicans took control of the state legislature in January 2011. In most states, teachers make more. North Carolina is one of the 10 lowest-paying states for teachers, and inflation-adjusted salaries have dropped 10.2 percent in the last decade, according to the NEA. Only three states saw teachers salaries fall by more between 2004-05 and 2014-15. Who is responsible? Both political parties have seen teacher pay rise and fall under their watch in the last decade, although Democrats were in power most of that time. Under Democratic Gov. Mike Easley average teacher pay grew by thousands of dollars, to $48,454 in 2008-09, his last year in office. Then the Great Recession happened and in 2009-10, Democratic Gov. Bev Perdue ordered a pay cut for state employees and teachers. That cut was approved by a Democrat-led legislature, and average teacher pay continued to fall every year under Perdue. Republicans were in charge of the statehouse the last two years of Perdues term. Both years, Perdue vetoed the budget and said more money shouldve been spent on education, but to no avail. Average teacher pay continued dropping after she left office. It reached its lowest point in McCrorys first budget – the third year of GOP legislative control – when it dipped below $45,000 to 47th in the nation in 2013-14. But since then, teacher pay has been rising. Its still not yet back to pre-recession levels, but it could be next year. The House, Senate and McCrorys office have all said teachers ought to earn more than $50,000 on average in 2016-17. Our ruling Clinton said the average North Carolina teachers salary can barely support a family and placed the blame squarely on Gov. Pat McCrory and Republican legislators. The average teacher salary of just less than $48,000 is higher than what most households around the state make per year. Yet its also right around whats considered the bare minimum living wage for a couple with two kids. Clinton, however, muddles the political blame. Average teacher pay did hit its lowest point when Republicans controlled both the governors office and General Assembly. Yet the only actual salary cuts happened under Democratic control. And more recently, Republicans have raised teacher pay almost back to pre-recession levels.  https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/af0c5cf5-08de-414b-8ccd-705444c458a8",0.7,0.5,1.0,0.6,0.4,0.6,0.4,0.8,0.6,Mostly True

The first image in a May 27 Facebook post shows a group of white men holding firearms, with no police presence in sight, in protest of COVID-19 stay-at-home orders. The image is contrasted with a more intense picture of police aiming tear gas at unarmed people on the ground who were protesting the death of George Floyd. The visual shows Minnesota May 2020! in red type. The caption emphasizes that point, saying same state, same month. The photographs are real depictions of recent protests, but they werent both taken in May 2020 in Minnesota. The images were flagged as part of Facebooks efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The top image shows a group of mostly armed, white men protesting Gov. Gretchen Whitmers stay-at-home order. It happened on April 15 in front of the Michigan State Capitol building in Lansing. Police did not fire tear gas. The image was taken by AFP photographer Jeff Kowalsky. At the time, protesters in several states were pushing for government officials to reopen the economy, saying the restrictions on business infringed upon their rights. There are photos that show a few armed anti-lockdown protestors outside of the Minnesota governor's mansion at the end of April. The second photo is from May 26, a day after video surfaced of a white Minneapolis police officer pinning down a black man by the throat with his knee. The man, George Floyd, pleaded repeatedly that he couldnt breathe and later died at the hospital. The officer, Derek Chauvin, was fired along with three others from the department. Chauvin was arrested on May 29 on charges of third-degree murder and manslaughter. The image of police spraying tear gas at protesters was included in multiple CBS broadcasts the first day of the Minneapolis protests when they were largely non-violent. A Facebook post says an image of armed protesters who werent tear gassed by police and an image of unarmed protesters shielding themselves from tear gas were both taken in May in Minnesota. One is, but one is not. The image of armed protesters is from Michigan in April.

Final Rating: Half True",The government made accommodation to the Fort Hood shooter to let him grow a beard for religious reasons.,"In the days before the second Republican presidential debate, candidate Mike Huckabee flew to the side of Kentucky clerk Kim Davis, who went to jail rather than issue same-sex marriage licenses. Davis said it violated her religious beliefs to put her name to the forms that would allow such marriages. During the debate, Huckabee said Davis represented an example of judicial tyranny. We made accommodation to the Fort Hood shooter to let him grow a beard, Huckabee said. We made accommodations to the detainees at Gitmo — Ive been to Gitmo, and Ive seen the accommodations that we made to the Muslim detainees who killed Americans. Youre telling me that you cannot make an accommodation for an elected Democrat county clerk from Rowan County, Kentucky? What else is it other than the criminalization of her faith and the exaltation of the faith of everyone else who might be a Fort Hood shooter or a detainee at Gitmo? In this fact-check, well focus on Huckabees claim about the Fort Hood killers beard and if he was allowed to keep it for religious reasons. The legal fight over Maj. Nidal Malik Hasans beard went back and forth. Ultimately, his jailers forcibly shaved him, but for a time, he was allowed to keep it. Trying the Fort Hood killer In November 2009, Army psychiatrist Hasan, an American of Palestinian descent, opened fire in a room at Fort Hood where soldiers were getting medical check-ups before deploying to Afghanistan. Hasan killed 13 people and wounded 30. As per Army regulations, until that point Hasan was clean-shaven. He began growing his beard while he awaited trial. According to the New York Times, he told his lawyers that he expected to die and thought it would violate his Muslim faith to die without one. The military prosecutors objected, saying the beard would make it harder for witnesses to identify Hasan. The trial judge, Col. Gregory Gross, objected on the grounds that the military code requires that everyone, with very few exceptions, be clean-shaven. The judge said that having a beard would disrupt the court proceedings. He held Hasan in contempt six times. The battle over Hasans beard was a snag that blocked his trial from moving forward. In September 2012, the judge ordered that Hasan be forcibly shaved. Thats no small matter. It takes a team of soldiers to restrain the prisoner and shave him while someone videotapes the entire process to guard against the undue use of force. Hasan appealed on the basis that the judges order violated his rights under the Religious Freedom Restoration Act. In December, a military appeals panel ruled that it was up to commanding officers, not a judge, to enforce the dress code. The panel also removed Judge Gross, saying that he could no longer appear unbiased. The panel specifically did not address whether religious freedom laws gave Hasan the right to a beard. We need not and do not decide if and how RFRA (Religious Freedom Restoration Act) might apply to Appellant's beard, the judges wrote. Should the next military judge find it necessary to address Appellant's beard, such issues should be addressed and litigated anew. The second trial judge allowed a bearded Hasan to attend the court hearings. In August 2013, Hasan was convicted on 13 counts of premeditated murder and 32 counts of attempted premeditated murder. He was sentenced to death. Hasan went to the detention barracks at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, where he joined the handful of other soldiers on death row. In September 2013, a year after the legal fight began, an Army spokesman said that Hasan had been forcibly shaved. Our ruling Huckabee said that legal rulings allowed Hasan the Fort Hood shooter to keep his beard on religious grounds. While an appeals court did overrule the initial trial judge who had ordered that Hasanbe forcibly shaved, that ruling did not affirm that Hasan had the right based on his religion. Instead, it said that it wasnt the judges job to enforce the military dress code, which requires personnel to be clean shaven. When Hasan was convicted and sent to Fort Leavenworth, he was forcibly shaved. Hasan did keep his beard for a while, but ultimately, no accommodation was made for religious reasons.",0.5,0.5,1,0.5,0,0.5,0.5,1,0.5,Half True

It was supposed to get big money out of politics and let candidates focus on talking to voters, not raising campaign cash. It was considered very progressive and very Portland, and city commissioners said they would put the issue to voters in 2010. Last week, those voters rejected it by a slim margin.Heather Stuart, spokeswoman for the Yes on 26-108 campaign, issued a statement the day after the election, expressing disappointment over the results. She said the other side had distorted the financial cost of the program, and she said that the campaign had suffered from the bad economy.Stuart also wrote this: Historical data shows that it is always more difficult to get a yes vote, especially in the face of organized opposition.The reporters at PolitiFact Oregon have been in the game long enough to know that, indeed, voters statewide tend to say no when the proposal on the ballot is confusing, is controversial or costs money. But Stuarts implication that statewide skepticism played a role in sinking a campaign-funding measure solely in Portland is suspect.Portland isn't like the rest of Oregon. Portland, which exists mostly in Multnomah County -- with teeny bits in Washington and Clackamas counties -- likes to say yes.We have backup from Pat McCormick, a veteran of ballot measure battles, most recently on the losing side over tax-raising Measures 66 and 67. He was hard-pressed to think of a spending plan that Portland didn't like. You have to do quite a bit to get to a 'no' on a money measure in this city, he said.Want more evidence? Lets take a stroll through the votes of Multnomah County. (Well use this because elections usually are conducted by counties, and Portland is the most dominant city in Multnomah County. Where appropriate, well cite Portland-only measures.)November 2010: County voters approved four of six statewide ballots measures, and five of seven county measures. County voters even approved the unpopular TriMet levy that failed because of opposition in Washington and Clackamas counties. And, finally, Portland voters werent afraid to embrace a property tax levy for new fire trucks and other emergency equipment.January 2010: Voters approved two statewide tax measures -- 66 and 67 -- by more than 70 percent.November 2008: County voters approved all three property tax levies on the ballot. They were for the Oregon Zoo, Portland Community College and childrens programs.November 2007: Voted yes on a statewide land-use rewrite, yes on a statewide tobacco tax that went down elsewhere; and yes to a city measure tweaking medical benefits for retired police and firefighters.May 2007: Of four wonky city measures on the ballot, voters said yes to all but one. (They opted to keep the citys commission-style of government.)November 2006: County voters renewed a local levy to continue library services and to give Metro more money for fish and wildlife protection. Portland voters also approved a schools levy and a measure to reform the police and fire disability and retirement fund. (But people on the outer edges of the city and county, who tend to be more tight-fisted, said no to levies for Mt. Hood Community College, Reynolds School District and David Douglas School District.)February 2004: Voters issued a rare no on Ballot Measure 30, which would have enacted a temporary tax surcharge and other changes to avoid budget cuts.January 2003: But the year before, Multnomah was one of just five counties in Oregon to say yes to Ballot Measure 28, which again would have increased taxes temporarily to plug the budget.November 2002: Voters approved funding for childrens programs, parks and the county library. (Again, Portland voters in the Parkrose and Reynolds school districts said no to operating levies for those schools.) And so on. Readers, you get the picture.Stuart said money is key here, as well as the strength of opposition. And shes right when saying that money measures, historically, have had some money behind them to send the message to voters. In this case, however, the organized opposition cited by Stuart spent one-fifth of what supporters did. Supporters spent $311,200, while the main opposition group spent $66,100.It was more than organized opposition or the bad economy or a general dislike of spending measures that defeated Voter Owned Elections, McCormick said. Voters really dont like it when politicians go ahead and spend taxpayer money and then come back and ask after the fact, Was it OK that I spent your money on this? Which is what happened here.So the statement contains some element of truth -- but it ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. Portland, as a city, is not one that says no a lot.  Comment on this item.",0.5,0.5,1.0,0.4,0.3,0.6,0.7,0.8,0.5,Half True

Final Rating: Mostly False  ","Through competition as governor, I got agreements to build a nearly $40-billion natural gas pipeline.","In her early campaign appearances, Gov. Sarah Palin has repeatedly boasted about her role in advocating a new natural gas pipeline in Alaska. And she has not always stuck to the truth, as we explainin a story here. This is her at a campaign appearance in Fairfax, Va., on Sept. 10, 2008: I'm ready to join John McCain in Washington so we can end the corrupt practices of the abuse of earmarks once and for all. We'll do that. Through competition as governor, I got agreements to build a nearly $40-billion natural gas pipeline. That's going to help all of you. A commitment to build new natural gas pipeline from Alaska's remote but resource-rich North Slope would indeed be quite an accomplishment. Alaskans have been seeking it for some three decades. As Palin campaigned for governor, she sharply criticized her predecessor's plan to have major oil companies build the pipeline. After she was elected governor, she sought competing proposals. In August 2008, the Legislature accepted one from TransCanada Corp., a Calgary-based company. Under a plan Palin spearheaded, TransCanada will get $500-million in state funds to design and seek approvals for the pipeline. But they are not obligated to build it. Financing and approvals are far from certain, and the company can back out even if those contingencies come through. Several experts we spoke to were skeptical that TransCanada's plan would come to fruition. I'll believe it when I see it, said Sarah Ladislaw, a fellow specializing in Western Hemispheric energy issues at the Center for Strategic & International Studies. Palin has repeatedly mischaracterized the agreement with TransCanada. In a news conference in Alaska on Aug. 1, 2008, she said the state never before had commitments to build this line. Now we do. In its news story the next day, theAnchorage Daily Newswrote: That's incorrect. TransCanada has not promised to actually build the gas line, one of the state's grandest and most frustrated economic development dreams. The state license ... is not a construction contract and does not guarantee a pipeline will be built. Rather, it's an exclusive deal under which the state will provide up to $500-million plus other incentives, such as a coordinator to speed up permits, in exchange for TransCanada doing its best to secure the customers, financing, and U.S. and Canadian regulatory clearances. Palin also frequently says the pipeline would cost nearly $40-billion, as she did in this claim. We're not sure where she got that figure — neither her office in Alaska nor the McCain campaign returned our calls to tell us. TransCanada estimates the cost at $26-billion. Yes, there could be cost overruns. But experts were skeptical the price could reach Palin's estimate. Palin's accomplishment sounds impressive in her words — far more than it actually is. The agreement she reached — with the help of the Alaska State Legislature — is not a commitment to build, but rather a commitment to begin planning the massive project. Palin's claim suggests that construction is assured, but that's just not true. And if it were, it wouldn't be a $40-billion pipeline. Those are two significant flaws in this claim Palin makes repeatedly. ",0.2,0.8,0.9,0.3,0.1,0.5,0.6,0.8,0.4,Mostly False

Final Rating: Mostly False  ","Says Judge Gonzalo Curiel is a member of a club or society, very strongly pro-Mexican.","Presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump says U.S. District Court Judge Gonzalo Curiel is not treating me fairly. Curiel ruled that the public can see internal papers from the now defunct Trump University. Trumps critics and reporters have pounced on the documents. Theyve pointed to examples of a calculated effort to target people who could ill-afford expensive training sessionsand had little chance of profiting from them. But for Trump, the bad press stems from a bad legal decision that has more to do with his immigration policies than the merits of a lawsuit. He said it is just common sense that Curiels ties to Mexico explain his ruling. Curiel, born and raised in Indiana, had parents who were naturalized U.S. citizens from Mexico. CBS News host John Dickerson pressed Trump as to what his parents had to do with him not ruling in Trumps favor. He is a member of a club or society, very strongly pro-Mexican, which is all fine, Trump said on Face the Nation on June 5. But I say, he's got bias. I want to build a wall. Its a serious matter to accuse federal judges of bias solely because of their ethnic background, and top-ranking Republicans have rejected Trumps line. Our interest though is strictly in this club that Trump referenced. Is it actually strongly pro-Mexican as he said? We reached out to the Trump campaign for details and did not hear back. The group in question is the California La Raza Lawyers Association. It dates back to 1977. The groups immediate past president, Joel Murillo, told us that it was formed in response to stereotyping coming from judges and lawyers. There were judges on the bench saying people with Spanish surnames were prone to be savages, Murillo said. When we tried to integrate with the mainstream bar association, we were denied. We were marginalized. The only people who were willing to work with us were us. Murillo says the days of stereotyping are over, and the group now focuses on the professional development of Latino lawyers and encouraging students to pursue a career in law. He called Trumps description of the association as very strongly pro-Mexican a misnomer. Murillo said most of the groups recent work targets improving the quality of education for all students in California. The group has not been involved in the immigration debate. The closest was when there were beatings by police and others that offended the constitutional rights of people, Murillo said. We made suggestions of ways toameliorate attacks on people with Spanish surnames. Our search of the Nexis newspaper database found an episode in 2004 when the association wrote a letter calling for the cancellation of a popular Los Angeles reality television show in which illegal immigrants competed for the free services of an immigration lawyer to apply for a green card. The show functions as a magnet to encourage people to enter this country without documentation, the letter said. The groups bylaws state, The purpose and goal of this association is to promote the interests of the Latino communities throughout the state and the professional interests of the membership. That membership is now about half Latino, Murillo said, and in terms of party affiliation, the lawyers who belong pretty much reflect the population. California is about 43 percent Democratic, 28 percent Republican and about 24 percent undeclared. Murillo also noted that strictly speaking, the group is focused on the Latino community, a term that is much broader than people with family roots in Mexico. The associations website, last updated in 2013, describes a judicial committee that seeks to increase the number of Latinos appointed to judgeships. Kevin Johnson, dean of the University of California Davis School of Law, told us the association is seen as a pretty moderate group thats mainly focused on civil rights. On the legal front, we found the group filed a 2012 friend of the court brief in support of Sergio Garcia, an undocumented immigrant from Mexico seeking admission to the State Bar of California. But the issue was broader than simple Hispanic solidarity. That brief was co-written by the Asian/Pacific Bar Association of Sacramento. In 2002, the San Francisco chapter joined with nine other organizations to support an appeal on the grounds that racism tainted the jury selection process. The defendant, Stanley Williams, did not have a Spanish surname, and the other organizations included the NAACP, the Southern Christian Leadership Conference of Los Angeles, the Asian Law Caucus and the American Civil Liberties Union of Northern California. We asked Johnson if including La Raza in the groups name carried a special meaning. He said the term is sort of a product of its times that emerged from the Chicano civil rights movement of the 1960s. The founders and presidents have not been remarkable, in a political sense, Johnson said. The group is often confused with the National Council of La Raza, an advocacy group often criticized by conservatives. Aside from a similarity in their names, the only tie we found was a link to the National Council of La Raza on the lawyers association website. But that list of links also includes the National Latino Police Officers Association and the Hispanic Chamber of Commerce. The conservative website Redstate posted an op-ed rebuking Trumps use of the California lawyers group as proof of Judge Curiels political motives. The writer, Leon Wolf, called the effort to disparage the association dishonest. As far as I can tell, they appear to be a pretty garden variety special interest lawyers association, Wolf wrote. Every state has these chapters for Hispanic lawyers, black lawyers, women lawyers, Mormon lawyers, Christian lawyers, Jewish lawyers -- you name it, there is a lawyer association for it in every state. Our ruling Trump said Curiel belonged to a group that is very strongly pro-Mexican. The California La Raza Lawyers Association does advance the interests of the Latino legal community and works on issues that matter in Latino communities more broadly. However, it has stayed on the sidelines in the immigration debate. The one exception is one letter from a dozen years ago which objected to a television show on the grounds that the program encouraged people to enter the country without documentation. The groups rare court filings focus on civil rights in general. Trumps statement is accurate only in the sense that the associations mission aims to support Latinos, but even that is flawed becausehe said the group was pro-Mexican and the Latino designation reaches a wider set of people. The claim ignores critical facts that would give a very different impression. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/65caa1ee-d498-4628-bfb0-06dfb82e4b14",0.5,0.7,0.9,0.7,0.4,0.6,0.5,1.0,0.5,Mostly False

Final Rating: False  ",Says a progressive income tax proposal from Democratic governor candidate J.B. Pritzker is wholly regressive.,"Illinois flat income tax, currently set at a rate of 4.95 percent for all individual taxpayers, is an outlier. The federal government, as well as most states that have an income tax, feature what is commonly referred to as a progressive tax system in which higher earners pay higher rates. Democrat J.B. Pritzker, the challenger to Republican Gov. Bruce Rauner in the November election, says he wants to switch Illinois to a progressive tax, though he has been vague about details. Rauners running mate, Lt. Gov. Evelyn Sanguinetti, recently ripped into Pritzkers tax plan during an interview on a Fox News-affiliated talk radio station that serves the Illinois suburbs of St. Louis. Pritzker will stick you with that progressive income tax which is surely to be an increase—not to mention the fact that it is wholly regressive, Sanguinetti told Marc Cox of KFTK. That is quite the oxymoron. Can a progressive income tax actually be regressive? We decided to check. The Illinois Constitution mandates a flat-rate income tax, and any move to try to change that would have to overcome difficult procedural hurdles in the state legislature as well as sharp ideological and political disputes. Republicans, Rauner among them, contend that taxing income at graduated levels would inevitably lead to an unfair and unnecessary tax increase in sheeps clothing. Democrats, meanwhile, insist the change is critical to easing the burden on lower-income taxpayers and raising revenue to fund key services like public education. Pritzker backs a constitutional amendment to allow for a progressive tax. As a stopgap until that could be accomplished, however, the Democrat says he wants to raise the current flat tax rate—he hasnt specified how much—but would make it artificially progressive by offsetting the increased cost for the non-affluent with enhanced tax credits. Thats where Sanguinettis up-is-down critique comes in. We asked a spokesman for the Rauner/Sanguinetti campaign to explain what she meant. He took a pass on explaining her thesis that progressive means regressive, but it seems unlikely it was a slip-of-the-tongue because the campaign promoted audio and a transcript of the interview on its website. No less an authority than the Internal Revenue Service says a regressive tax pretty much means what it sounds like, too. The IRS defines it as a tax that takes a larger percentage of income from low-income groups than from high-income groups. The spokesman, Justin Giorgio, did however weigh in on Sanguinettis contention that taxes would rise. Lt. Governor Sanguinetti was simply saying that if J.B. Pritzker has his way, more Illinoisans will be paying higher taxes, Giorgio said in an email, referencing Pritzkers constitutional workaround plan. That fact check noted that a Pritzker spokesman had specifically ruled out anything that would raise taxes on middle-class families. It also highlighted how several states with graduated taxes had set rates for middle- and low-income earners below the flat tax rate Illinois now charges. As for Sanguinettis progressive-is-regressive scenario, economist J. Fred Giertz with the Institute of Government and Public Affairs at the University of Illinois told us a plan like Pritzkers wouldnt qualify as regressive. If lower income people pay a lower rate than higher income people, that by definition is a progressive rate, Giertz said. The only way a regressive rate exists is if low-income people pay  a higher rate of tax. For the record, Giertz says Illinois current flat-tax system isnt regressive either and could even be considered slightly progressive because it already includes some tax credits for low-income earners that enable them to pay a lower effective tax rate than those of higher income. Sanguinetti said in a recent radio interview that Pritzkers plan for a progressive income tax is wholly regressive. A spokesman declined to explain what she meant by that. But the federal definition for a regressive tax makes her statement read like something straight out of Opposite Day. According to both the IRS and an Illinois economics expert, a regressive tax is one that takes a greater share of income from those who earn less than from those who earn more. A progressive tax, on the other hand, is one that requires higher earners to pay a higher rate than their lower earning counterparts.",0,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,False

Obama's finance team is recommending a . . . 1% tax on all transactions at any financial institution.,"Is President Obama's finance team scheming with Congress to place a 1-percent tax on every banking transaction you make?That's the assertion of an e-mail that's been showing up in local inboxes.It says: President Obama's finance team is recommending a transaction tax. His plan is to sneak it in after the November election to keep it under the radar. This is a 1% tax on all transactions at any financial institution.The e-mail is anonymous -- isn't it always? -- but it says, in effect, that if you deposit $1,000, $10 will go to the government. If you withdraw $1,000, $10 from the balance remaining in your account will be sent to Washington. The e-mail claims that the bill, HR-4646, was introduced by Rep. Peter DeFazio, D-Ore., and Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa.Because DeFazio is from Oregon, Oregon PolitiFact checked into the claim and reported its findings last month. Here's what they said, reprinted with a few editing changes:The bill, HR-4646, is indeed actual legislation whose subject has something to do with taxation. But that's where the similarities end.The Debt Free America Act was introduced by Rep. Chaka Fattah, D-Pa., in February 2010. He proposed a 1-percent tax on all money transactions, including cash transactions, checks, credit cards, those processed through the Federal Reserve Bank, and those collected at the point of sale. Fattah's idea was to use the money to pay down the national debt and eventually replace the income tax. He has proposed similar legislation since 2004.HR-4646 had no support -- and certainly not from Obama's finance team -- and is now dying a quiet death in committee. Yet the resolution continues to live online, where the DeFazio connection has been repeated by a former Hernando County (Fla.) commissioner.Penny Dodge, DeFazio's chief of staff, told PolitiFact Oregon that the congressman opposes HR-4646. An unamused DeFazio doesn't know who is behind the e-mail attack.It's slanderous, DeFazio said of the electronic claim. I have nothing to do with the bill, no one pays any attention to the bill. It's chronically introduced, and never received any attention before this.One final point about the e-mail that's been circulating in Rhode Island. It says at the beginning, You can confirm with Snopes as it is no exageration (sic), a reference to our good friends at Snopes.com, which examines the truthfulness of urban legends.Yet if you actually search Snopes.com, you'll discover that the website concluded that it IS an exaggeration.

Final Rating: False  ",Homemade baby formula recipes offer a viable option during U.S. shortage,"As people grapple with Americas infant formula shortage, some social media users have started sharing homemade recipes, telling frantic parents who cant find food for their babies that they can make their own formula instead. One post claimed, falsely, that the shortage is manufactured and then went on to say that people could use raw goats milk or make her friends homemade recipe. Another offered a recipe with cows milk, whey and a variety of oils, saying homemade formula can be a viable option when you do it correctly. And another offered up a tattered 1960s recipe card that called for giving the baby two level tablespoons of Karo corn syrup. Feeding babies homemade formula — no matter how legitimate or questionable the recipe may appear — is dangerous and not recommended as an alternative to store-bought formula. The post was flagged as part of Facebooks efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The U.S. Food and Drug Administration advises against making formula and says consuming homemade formula can result in adverse health effects for infants. The American Academy of Pediatrics also strongly advises against homemade formulas, saying they are not safe and do not meet babies nutritional needs. The shortage of infant formula has been attributed to COVID-19 related supply chain issues, inflation, and a February 2022 product recall by Abbott, a major U.S. manufacturer of baby food, that temporarily halted production at its Sturgis, Michigan plant. The White House recently announced steps intended to ease the shortage, including making it easier to import formula and cracking down on price gouging. The FDA is also expediting and streamlining some of its processes in an effort to address the shortage. Following cases in 2021 of hospitalized infants suffering from low calcium after being fed homemade formula, the FDA reported that potential problems with homemade versions include contamination and inadequate amounts of critical nutrients. These problems are very serious, and the consequences range from severe nutritional imbalances to foodborne illnesses, both of which can be life-threatening, the agency said. Homemade formulas may not provide enough of some nutrients, or they can contain too-large quantities of others, which is equally dangerous. For example, homemade formula might have too much salt, which infants kidneys and livers cannot handle in large amounts, wrote Dr. Steven Abrams, chair of the National Committee on Nutrition for the American Academy of Pediatrics, in a May 9 blog post. If your baby doesn't get enough of the important parts of infant formula — even for a few days or weeks — they can suffer long term effects on their abilities to grow strong and do well in school, Abrams said. Lack of these nutrients can lead to severe health problems and even death. Homemade formulas may also lead to risks of contamination, causing infections or may even cause serious problems with high or low levels of minerals like calcium or electrolytes such as sodium. Commercial infant formulas, on the other hand, are designed to mimic human breast milk as closely as possible, and are carefully regulated to make sure they have the nutrients growing babies need — in a form their bodies can process, the New York Times reported. Social media users are sharing homemade infant formula recipes amid the shortage and are claiming that homemade formula is safe. Pediatricians and organizations like the American Academy of Pediatrics and FDA all advise against making and feeding homemade baby formula to infants. These recipes can rob babies of essential nutrients needed for development and may also lead to risks of contamination and infection. Such recipes arent considered safe and should not replace store-bought formula.",0,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,False

Final Rating: False","The Vaccine Adverse Event Recording System shows that 5,946 people have died because of the COVID-19 vaccine.","A TikTok video liked more than 936,000 times claims that COVID-19 vaccines have killed some 6,000 people in the United States. The Vaccine Adverse Event Recording System shows that 5,946 people have died because of the vaccine, the user states, referring to a government database called the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System, or VAERS. The TikTok post was shared on Facebook and flagged as part of Facebooks efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Thats not what VAERS shows. In fact, there have been no established or proven cases of a COVID-19 vaccine causing death in the U.S. VAERS is run by two federal agencies, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Food and Drug Administration. It is designed so that any person can report an adverse event that occurs after a vaccination, and anyone can scour the reports. The system helps researchers collect data on vaccine after-effects and to detect patterns that may warrant a closer look. But VAERS accepts reports without verifying whether a vaccine actually caused that incident. That makes VAERS a breeding ground for misinformation that spreads quickly on social media and elsewhere. For more than 30 years, VAERS data has been misused to justify broad conclusions that vaccines are harmful. As for COVID-19, more than 346 million doses of vaccines were administered in the U.S. from Dec. 14, 2020, through Aug. 2, 2021, according to the CDC. During that period, VAERS received 6,490 reports of death (0.0019%) among people who received a COVID-19 vaccine. But VAERS reports alone do not indicate whether a vaccine causes a particular adverse effect. They indicate only that a particular event occurred after a vaccination. Researchers can use that data as a starting point to study whether the event is linked to the vaccine.

Final Rating: False","If you log into the government's Cash for Clunkers Web site (cars.gov) from your home computer, the government can seize all of your personal and private information, and track your computer activity.","On Glenn Beck's Fox News program on July 31, 2009, Fox anchor Kimberly Guilfoyle suggested that clicking on the government's Cash for Clunkers Web page (cars.gov) would give the government complete access to your home computer. The accusation came in a back-and-forth exchange among Beck, Guilfoyle and Jonah Goldberg, author of  Liberal Fascism.  After warning viewers not to try this at home, Beck typed in cars.gov., the U.S. Department of Transportation Web site for the program better known as Cash for Clunkers. Here is Cars.gov, Beck said. Let's say you go in. If I understand this right, I go in and I say, 'I want to turn in my clunker.' The dealer goes to Cars.gov, and then they hit 'submit transaction.' Here it says 'privacy act and security statement,' and it's like, oh, it's the Privacy Act of 1974. Whatever. I agree.But when you pull it up, he noted, here's how the warning statement read: This application provides access to the DOT CARS system. When logged on to the CARS system, your computer is considered a federal computer system and it is property of the United States Government. Any or all uses of this system and all files on this system may be intercepted, monitored, recorded, copied, audited, inspected, and disclosed to authorized CARS, DOT, and law enforcement personnel, as well as authorized officials of other agencies, both domestic and foreign.Good God Almighty! Beck said.Said Guilfoyle: Could it be any more broad and frightening? Here you are trying to be a good citizen and make a charitable contribution, do something that's good — and guess what? They are jumping right inside you, seizing all of your personal and private (information) ... And it's absolutely legal, Glenn. They can do it.They can continue to track you basically forever, Guilfoyle warned. Once they tap into your system, the government, of course, has like malware systems and tracking cookies and they can tap in anytime they want.Can you believe that? she asked. I mean, seriously, they can get all your information.Later, Goldberg said it was all very troubling. And, look, let me give you a hard example of this. Say you use Skype or some other Internet phone system, right? If you're on the phone while logged in on this thing, according to this, according to a lawyer I talked to before ... the government can legally listen to your phone call. They can check out what Web sites you've been searching.Because it says ... your computer is a government's property, Goldberg said.That's correct, if you log on to this at your home, everything in your home is now theirs? Beck asked.Basically, Guilfoyle said, and there's nothing you can do. To dissect this one, we have to begin by noting the small amount of truth in their comments. The statement Beck read was on a government Web site for auto dealers, but Guilfoyle twists that into some incorrect claims about the government getting access to individuals. Here's the true part: The Department of Transportation confirmed the language was on the cars.gov Web site, but on Aug. 3 it was removed. The DOT released this statement to PolitiFact: A security warning on the CARS.gov dealer support page that stated computers logged into the system were considered property of the Federal Government has been removed. We are working to revise the language. The language was posted on the portion of the website accessible by car dealers and not the general public. It would be factually inaccurate to say that any computer that went to cars.gov would become the property of the U.S. government, said Sasha Johnson, a DOT spokeswoman said. Although Beck began his segment by noting that the warning was on a part of the site for dealers, Guilfoyle then distorted the truth by suggesting it applied to members of the general public coming to the site for information about Cash for Clunkers. The allegations escalated as she and Goldberg issued warnings about anyone even typing in that address at home. And that's just wrong. Beck seemed to concede that point when raising the issue again on Aug. 3. Now, these blogs have come out this weekend and said, 'Oh, there goes Glenn Beck trying to stir up trouble again. It doesn't affect the average person. It's just the car dealerships.' I'm sorry. I'm sorry. It's just the car dealerships. Oh, so then I shouldn't care? It's not the average people? It's just the average people who are in small business running the car dealerships, Beck said. DOT's Johnson said the government has no plans to take over the computer of auto dealers either. And, again, the language was removed on Aug. 3. But the language was there when Beck and Guilfoyle first raised their concerns. And clearly the language was overly broad, and bad enough to give ammunition to conspiracy theorists. That much is implied by the fact the government felt the need to remove the language. So in that sense, we think the DOT bears some blame for the confusion. Had she said from the start that this just applied to dealers completing transactions, we might be more generous in our ruling. But we think anyone who saw the July 31 program — in which she claimed seriously, they can get all your information — would be left with the clear impression that anyone who logged into the cars.gov site was opening their computer to Big Brother. And that's False.",0,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,False

Final Rating: False  ","Says that President Joe Biden said Americans will start seeing direct deposits in their bank accounts this weekend, and that Medicare recipients will get back $2,880.","A video shared on Facebook purports to show President Joe Biden announcing that Americans will get a new round of stimulus payments over the next several weeks. Some people in the country will start seeing those direct deposits in their bank accounts this weekend, Biden says in the Feb. 15 video. Payments to eligible Americans will continue throughout the course of the next several weeks. The video features a split screen view of Biden giving a speech at the top and signing an executive order at the bottom. Care First Homes, the Facebook page that shared the clip, claims that it came across (the video) on the news last night. My friend also called me this morning and told me about the great news for Medicare holders in the US, the account goes on to say. All I did was entered my zip on the website and confirmed my Medicare details and now we are getting back $2880. Just check zip on the website! Americans expecting any such payment will be left disappointed, because the video is a fake and didnt appear on any recent newscast. This post was flagged as part of Facebooks efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The voice heard on the video isnt Bidens but of an impersonator mimicking his speaking style. The voice also doesnt match the mouth movements in the video clip of Biden, which repeats in a loop every four seconds. The clips of Biden speaking and signing an executive order were not related to stimulus payments. The speaking clip was taken from footage of a speech he gave Nov. 1, 2021, on climate change at the COP26 summit in Glasgow, Scotland. The clip of Biden signing an executive order is from Feb. 24, 2021, when he signed an order related to a global shortage of electronic chips. The voiceover actually uses comments made by White House press secretary Jen Psaki on March 11, 2021, about the American Rescue Plan Act. PolitiFact previously checked a claim that also repurposed Psaki's comments as proof of a new round of stimulus payments and rated it False. The federal government has sent out three rounds of COVID-19 relief payments to Americans. While some legislators have called for a fourth round of payments, it has yet to be approved. The Facebook post also mentions Medicare recipients will also receive $2,800, but we have not been able to find any evidence to back this claim. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, the federal agency that administers the Medicare program, did not immediately respond to PolitiFacts request for comment. A different social media post claimed Medicare recipients were eligible for a flexible spending card that covered up to $2,880 in expenses — the same amount as mentioned in the Facebook post. PolitiFact ruled that Mostly False. The cards are offered by private insurers, not Medicare. A Facebook video purports to show President Biden announcing a new round of stimulus payments to Americans, and the caption on the post claims Medicare recipients will receive $2,880. The video was doctored, using an imitator to mimic Biden. The video actually repurposed comments made by Jen Psaki regarding the American Rescue Plan Act in March. We found no evidence to back the claim about Medicare recipients receiving $2,880.",0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,False

Final Rating: False  ",Says Deputy Comptroller Aycha Sawa blocked an audit of the Milwaukee lead program for three years that put our children in danger and spurred a criminal investigation.,"In an election season already historically bizarre due to the coronavirus pandemic, of course we have a down-and-dirty race for a position in city finance. The normally low-profile Milwaukee comptroller post, held since 2012 by the retiring Martin Matson, is up for grabs, pursued by Deputy Comptroller Aycha Sawa and state Assembly Democrat Jason Fields. The comptroller is the citys chief financial officer, but a series of ads from a dark-money group backing Fields have made this a race about lead pipes. The specifics of the claim vary by ad, but one mailer sent to various homes in Milwaukee summed up the core of the attacks on Sawa. The flier, funded by the Leaders for a Better Community, says this: For three years, Deputy Comptroller Aycha Sawa and the Milwaukee Comptrollers office blocked an audit of Milwaukees lead abatement programs. This put our children in danger. Her inaction has even led to a criminal investigation. Lets be clear up front — that is a wild exaggeration at every turn. Heres the breakdown. Leaders for a Better Community is a politically active nonprofit that doesnt have to disclose the source of its funds. The supposed issue ad directs readers to call a number at the comptrollers office (a number no longer in use) or visit the groups website for more information on their plan for transparency and accountability (no such plan is posted). The group was founded in 2015 and previously supported Fields in a 2016 run for state Assembly, according to the Wisconsin Democracy Campaign. It is run by Sherwin Hughes, a long-time friend of Fields. Fields referred to Hughes in a March 8, 2020, Facebook post as our guy, our friend, my brother, an advisor. The race pits Fields against Sawa, who has worked in the office she now seeks to run since 2010, working her way up from auditor to lead auditor, audit manager, accounting director and now deputy comptroller. Fields served in the state Assembly from 2005-13, and now again since 2017. He has also worked as a stockbroker and runs several local organizations. A February 2020 Milwaukee Journal Sentinel story noted he is seeking the citys top finance job despite a background that includes a bankruptcy in 2016 and drunken driving convictions from 2008 and 2014. The ad campaign ignores those backgrounds and focuses on the citys lead abatement program. The program, run by the Milwaukee Health Department, is the subject of an outside audit and was condemned in a state report from 2018 that found more than 90% of cases were closed before the amount of lead in a childs' blood had dropped to levels deemed safe by the state, among numerous other failings. So lets get back to the ad. As evidence of its multiple claims, the mailer lists four sources in footnotes: None of these prove the claims in any way. In an email to PolitiFact Wisconsin, Hughes provided no additional direct evidence, stating simply: The city of Milwaukee had been requesting lead abatement audit for years. Per the current comptroller, Sawa was in charge of audit division. That response is just as misleading as the mailer itself. Heres the reality behind the mailers claims. For three yearsblocked an audit of Milwaukee lead abatement Hughes did not respond to a question asking what three-year window this referred to. But another flier references this in the present tense, saying the office has refused for three years, so well work from the assumption it is a 2017 to 2020 window. Matson, the current comptroller, said in a phone interview an audit of the lead program was never on the table before the rampant lead issues around the city began coming to light in 2016 and 2017. The lead program in the city years ago was considered the example for the rest of the country, so it was considered a low-risk item, he said. By the time lead concerns in Milwaukee became more public, Sawa was no longer in charge of the audit division. She held that position from 2012 until February 2015, when she was promoted to accounting director, Matson said. Even the behind-the-scenes memos where city officials discussed issues with the lead program were just starting to circulate in early 2015. That was an outright lie, Matson, who has endorsed Sawa, said of the blocking claim. Then theres this key detail: An audit has in fact taken place, conducted by an outside agency, and it was recently completed. Put our children in danger Its absurd to attribute this to Sawa, who at the time lead concerns were raised was the accounting director. Her job there was assuring the accuracy of the citys financial statements, her biography says. Her inaction has even led to a criminal investigation This is flat-out ridiculous. The criminal investigation connected to the lead testing is of the health department, not the comptrollers office. The investigation came after former health commissioner Bevan Baker was forced from his job in January 2018, and a number of other staffers were disciplined, forced to resign or fired. There was never a criminal probe into Sawa or the comptrollers office. The actual audit involved has yet to be released to the public, though Matson said a copy of the findings have been submitted to the city. In January 2018, the Common Council directed the city clerk to audit all Health Department programs within 90 days, as lead concerns grew. Matson said he objected at the time, arguing this was both not humanly possible and that only a few organizations around the country were qualified to audit a lead abatement program, so the council rescinded the request and asked the comptrollers office to seek an outside audit. The city eventually reached an agreement in February 2019 for an audit by the Public Health Foundation, a nonprofit organization based in Washington, D.C., and it began work in May 2019. A flier attacking Sawa says she blocked an audit of the citys lead abatement program for three years that put our children in danger and spurred a criminal investigation. But Sawas oversight of city audits ended in 2015, well before any concerns with the citys lead testing program publicly came to light. And in any case, there was never any suggested or proposed audit brought forward that she could block. Implying she continued blocking something for a three-year span is pure fiction — as is the claim that her actions spurred a criminal investigation. The investigation was of the health department, not Sawa or the comptrollers office. And, of course, an audit has in fact been done.",0,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,False

Final Rating: False  ","Says during George W. Bushs administration we were losing millions of jobs per month, while under Barack Obama we have three years of gaining hundreds of thousands of jobs per month.","On the day of the final release of jobs numbers before the presidential election, liberal filmmaker Michael Moore tweeted a comparison of how the job market has fared under President Barack Obama and his predecessor, President George W. Bush.Under Bush we were LOSING MILLIONS of jobs per month; under Obama we have 3 yrs of gaining hundreds of thousands of jobs per mo, Moore tweeted to his 1.2 million followers.Were Moores figures correct? No -- in fact, Moore conceded so himself when he sent a corrected tweet about five hours later. Let's look at the numbers.Job losses under BushWe turned to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the governments official collector of employment numbers. Since Moore didnt specify what types of jobs he was referring to, we took the most basic measure -- private sector jobs combined with government jobs, not counting farm jobs or the military.During Bushs final year -- the year with the heaviest job losses during his tenure -- the monthly net change in jobs bottomed out in the fourth quarter. Between October 2008 and November 2008, the economy shed 803,000 jobs. Between November 2008 and December 2008, the economy lost 661,000 jobs. And between January 2009 and December 2008, the economy lost 818,000 -- the highest number of Bushs tenure (and higher than any monthly loss under Obama).Thats a huge number, but its not MILLIONS. In fact, its not even 1 million. So Moores tweet exaggerated the size of the losses under Bush.Job gains under ObamaThe job picture did eventually improve under Obama, but Moore exaggerates when he says the economy has been gaining hundreds of thousands of jobs per month for the last three years under Obama.During 2010, the job market expanded by an average of 85,000 per month. In 2011, the average rose to 153,000 per month. And in 2012, the average rose again, to 157,000 per month.Those numbers are a whole lot better than what the nation experienced in 2008, but these rises dont qualify as hundreds of thousands, which we would define as at least 200,000.What about increases above 200,000 during individual months? Looking at the 34 months since January 2010, the net increase has exceeded 200,000 jobs a total of 10 times, or less than one-third of the time. And several of those were months where the job numbers were boosted only temporarily due to a flurry of hiring for the once-a-decade U.S. Census. Moore's correction About five hours after Moore's original tweet was posted, and after we had contacted his office, he sent a tweet correcting the record. Thx for tweets on job loss - worst month w/Bush was 800K+ jobs lost, most months since '10 have had 100K+ jobs gained http://mmflint.me/QbEkPM. Moore's second tweet was correct. Our rulingMoore's initial tweet was incorrect when it said the nation was losing millions of jobs per month under Bush, since even the weakest month under Bush saw the economy lose less than 1 million jobs per month. And he was also incorrect to say that the economy has been gaining hundreds of thousands of jobs per month for three years under Obama. The economy has averaged well under 200,000 jobs per month during that period and only exceeded the job-gain threshold of 200,000 in 10 months. We applaud his correction, but we still rate his initial tweet False.",0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,False

Final Rating: False",A photo shows sex traffickers using an abandoned child car seat to lure in victims.,"Social media users continue to share posts claiming that sex traffickers are using abandoned car seats to lure in victims, even as local police and the organization behind the National Human Trafficking Hotline have said such claims are unfounded. Human trafficking is a legitimate threat that affects millions of people. But the photo of an empty child car seat sitting in a parking lot was not the tell-all that social media users were making it out to be. The photo appears to have originated with an Oct. 9 Facebook post. The poster wrote that the car seat was in the parking lot of a Walmart in Wilkesboro, North Carolina. Sex traffickers use this method to lure you in and snatch you up, the poster claimed.  An Oct. 9Facebook post claimed sex traffickers were using an abandoned car seat to lure victims. The Facebook post was shared more than 700 times, and screenshots of it were flagged as part of the platforms efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) But the viral internet rumor exploded further online after a TikTok user warned about what she described as the latest trap from sex traffickers. The video from Paige Marie Parker, who describes herself as a spiritual gardener and now has more than 178,000 followers, was reported by Rolling Stone after it got 12.2 million views in just over a day. It is no longer available on TikTok, but PolitiFact found a copy of it online. So have you ever seen this type of car seat just out of nowhere? Parker says in the video, as she points to a Facebook post from the Wilkesboro Police Department addressing the car seat photo and rumors. Thats not an ordinary car seat. Thats actually a trap. Thats actually a sex trafficking car seat, Parker continues. No parent will ever leave a random car seat out there just to be out there. They want you to go up to the car seat and look around while theyll really snatch you really quick. Its a ploy. Please be safe out here ladies. Its important for people to stay aware of their surroundings. Should you want to report or seek services related to a case of human trafficking, you can contact the National Human Trafficking Hotline at 1-888-373-7888 or email [emailprotected]. But the Wilkesboro Police Department statement that Parker highlighted in her video did not confirm that traffickers are using car seats to draw in victims; instead, it debunked the rumor. The department wrote that it had investigated the car seat photo from the original Facebook post, and that the backstory had nothing to do with sex trafficking. At no time was this incident deemed to be involved in any criminal activity, the department concluded. The car seat was in the parking lot, the police said, because two Walmart customers purchased a new child car seat, then they removed their old one and left it there. Interim department chief Tommy Rhodes told the Associated Press that the police reviewed security footage of the events to determine what happened. If we for one second thought that was a sex trafficking ploy, we would be all over that, Rhodes said. Polaris, the organization that runs the National Human Trafficking Hotline, said in its own statement that when narratives like the car seat myth go viral, it can do serious harm to actual trafficking survivors, including by overwhelming anti-trafficking organizations limited resources to respond to tips. Recent rumors about sex traffickers using abandoned child car seats to lure victims are unfounded, the Polaris statement said. A similar Facebook post claimed in September that empty baby car seats are being used as a lure to get you out of your car so you can be abducted or followed. The post purported to show photos of a car seat left in a parking lot in Nashville. It was shared nearly 300,000 times. Other unsubstantiated internet rumors warning about human trafficking plots have taken off in the past. One rumor spread on Facebook in 2019 cautioned that sex traffickers were afixing zip ties to car door handles as a means of distracting victims. Another claim from 2019, amplified by the then-mayor of Baltimore, alleged that sex traffickers were driving white vans.  More recently, supporters of the QAnon movement advanced evidence-free conspiracy theories that separately accused Walmart and Wayfair, an online furniture retailer, of using certain items as cover for selling and shipping children to pedophiles. Facebook posts claimed that a photo shows a plot by sex traffickers to use abandoned child car seats to lure in victims. Police investigated the photo of an abandoned car seat that inspired this internet rumor. They concluded that it was not associated with sex trafficking or other criminal activity. Polaris, which runs the National Human Trafficking Hotline, called the rumor unfounded and a myth.",0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,False

Final Rating: False  ",Says Barack Obama counted on Sandy Adams to approve stimulus spending.,"Things get ugly when two sitting lawmakers vie for the same seat.This is certainly the case in the Republican primary battle for Floridas 7th Congressional District.The Central Florida race features Rep. John Mica, a political veteran with a role in House leadership, and Rep. Sandy Adams, who rode the 2010 tea party wave out of the state Legislature and into Congress.In a scathing mailpiece, Mica claims he is the right person to represent the reorganized 7th Congressional District because Adams is in cahoots with President Barack Obama.The piece states in large type, Barack Obama counted on Sandy Adams.Some more excerpts: Sandy Adams Voted Twice to Approve $8 Billion in Obama Stimulus Spending.Compare Sandy Adams to John Mica before you vote in the Republican primary.John Mica is the only Republican in this race to vote against Obama stimulus.Wait, what? Didnt Adams, a tea party favorite endorsed by Sarah Palin, come to Washington in 2011? How could she have supported Obamas 2009 economic stimulus package?The mailer offers citations, in the form of bill numbers and vote dates, to back up its claims. Such a gesture sometimes gives us hope that truthfulness will be found. Alas, no. Micas claim is illogical.The citations are for annual state budgets the Florida Legislature passed in 2009 (SB 2600) and 2010 (HB 5001). Indeed, Adams, then a member of the Florida House, voted for both.Lawmakers faced a tremendous budget shortfall in 2009, and part of the way they offset damaging cuts was to accept $5 billion from the federal stimulus program (and through raising taxes and fees on Floridians by $2.2 billion). The same story emerged in 2010, with $2.4 billion from the stimulus program piped in to patch the deficit.Adams wasnt the only House Republican to vote for these budgets. The plans sailed through the Legislature along party lines, with Republicans almost unanimously in favor. Democrats who voted against the budget in 2009 called it inadequate.Adams, who campaigned against government waste like a lot of her GOP contemporaries, referred to the stimulus as a failed bill in a 2010 Orlando Sentinel op-ed.Micas team says thats not her real position. We needed to let voters know that her record does not match the rhetoric, said Mica spokesman Alan Byrd. Congressman Mica voted no.We have to say, though, we find this line of argument ridiculous.Using Micas logic, that means Obama also counted on Gov. Rick Scott, a high-profile basher of Obamas stimulus and health care reforms. The first budget Scott signed containedmillions of stimulus dollars, after all.Plus, Adams team said Mica is being hypocritical. They pointed to severalinstances in which Mica, along with eight other House Republicans, voted no on the stimulus and then publicly campaigned for Florida to receive stimulus money for projects such as high-speed rail just hours later. His critique of it then was that it didnt spend enough money on transportation projects.Our rulingMica says Obama counted on Adams to approve stimulus spending. That's not the case. Congress approved the stimulus in 2009, before Adams took her seat in 2011. Adams did vote for two state budgets that contained stimulus money, as did many other Florida legislators who opposed the federal law.Likewise, Mica himself lobbied for stimulus projects in Florida once the stimulus became law.Mica's mailer is misleading and hardly offers an apples-to-apples comparison. Adams couldnt have voted on the stimulus program because she wasnt even a member of Congress at the time.We rule this statement Pants on Fire!",0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,False

Final Rating: False  ",Justice Kennedy quit because he and his son helped Trump launder illegal Russian money through Deutsche Bank.,"The New York Timesdetailed connections between the Trump White House and Justice Anthony Kennedy, searching for factors that might have inspired Kennedy to retire so abruptly before the November midterms. The newspaper examined a number of connections that the Trump family might have exploited to earn Kennedys trust: constant praise for his work, the routine promotion of his clerks, and visits from the presidents family. But some conspiracy-minded bloggers have honed in on two paragraphs, nestled in the middle of the article: Kennedys son, Justin Kennedy, had worked with Deutsche Bank when it loaned over $1 billion to Trump, even when other banks had become wary of him. In the New York Times article, this is just one piece of evidence to show that the Kennedy and Trump families were close outside of politics. However, liberal clickbait site Kwotable used the detail to suggest corruption on a much more massive, though unsupported, scale. Its June 30 headline read, Justice Kennedy quit because he and his son helped Trump launder illegal Russian money through Deutsche Bank. The New York Times report didnt go that far, so we decided to dig deeper into the Kwotable claim. Trumps relationship with Deutsche Bank began in the late nineties when many other major lenders were unwilling to do business with him. Between 1991 and 1992, Trump declared bankruptcy four times, making him unpopular among Wall Street bankers, who referred to making deals with him as Donald risk. Deutsche Bank opened up to working with Trump after launching its real estate division in 1998. Mike Offit, a newly-hired managing director, gave Trump a loan to renovate his building on Wall Street, and continued to work with him through the 2008 financial crisis. According to a 2017 report by the New York Times, Trump has done more than $4 billion in business with Deutsche since then, including the construction of Trump Tower in Chicago and the Trump National Doral in Miami. Justin Kennedy began working at Deutsche in 1998 as the managing director and global head of Real Estate Capital Markets, a role he held until leaving in 2009. Kennedy oversaw and approved major real estate loans given through the bank, including multiple loans made to Trump for his real estate enterprise. Trumps connections to Russia are still being investigated by special counsel Robert Mueller. But Deutsche Banks relationship to the country is well-documented, and controversial. In early 2017, banking regulators fined the bank $630 million for its negligence in stopping a Russia-based money laundering scheme, in which Russian clients engaged in illegal mirror-trading. (One client would purchase stocks in rubles through the Moscow branch, and then a conspirator would sell identical stocks for the same price, but through the London branch and in dollars. This money would be transferred to offshore accounts, effectively allowing traders to illegally transfer billions of dollars out of Russia. According to Reuters, this scheme began in 2011.) Between 2010 and 2014, the bank was also involved in the Global Laundromat scandal, which allowed over $20 billion to be funneled from Russia to other countries around the world. The Global Laundromat was a much larger operation than the mirror-trading. It involved top Russian oligarchs and criminals—including Igor Putin, cousin of President Vladimir Putin. The banks name has come up in the Mueller investigation as well, but not in the way the Kwotable article makes you think. In December 2017, Muellers team subpoenaed Deutsche Bank records connected with former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort, who had been indicted in October on suspicion of money laundering, among other crimes. However, there has been no evidence to date that Trump himself was involved with any of the money laundering — or that either Kennedy was involved. Democrats have called for more transparency in Trumps banking history,but the bank has denied their requests, citing confidentiality concerns. The records would be released only in the event of a formal investigation. As for Justin Kennedy, he left Deutsche Bank in 2009, before investigators say the Global Laundromat or mirror-trading scandals began. He has not been formally investigated or accused of involvement in financial foul play. Kennedy and Deutsche Bank declined to comment for this story. Bloggers wrote that Justice Kennedy retired last week because he and his son helped launder illegal Russian money through Deutsche Bank. This story has all the buzz words to make a good conspiracy theory: Russia, real estate, billions of dollars, coincidence, corruption. But there is no evidence that Trump and Justin Kennedy ever had a relationship beyond Trumps real estate loans. There is also no evidence that Kennedy was involved in Russian money laundering, as he left the bank before either of the major scandals happened, or that the Trump White House was blackmailing his father because of it.",0,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,False

Final Rating: Mostly False  ","Says as we sit right now, Medicare, if we do nothing, will be gone in eight years, if we do nothing to it.","Do nothing, U.S. Rep. Jon Runyan said, and the nearly 50-year-old Medicare program will vanish in eight years.Runyan, a Republican representing parts of southern New Jersey, sounded that alarm during a May 4 interview with Michael Aron on NJTVs On the Record.I was elected to make those hard (decisions) and have those serious discussions, and kicking the can down the road and not having those discussions and putting ideas out there on how to solve them, and how to actually preserve these programs for future generations, cause as we sit right now, Medicare, if we do nothing, will be gone in eight years, if we do nothing to it, Runyan said.Medicare -- which provided healthcare coverage to 48.7 million Americans in 2011 -- is eight years away from ceasing to exist?Not at all, PolitiFact New Jersey found.One of Medicares two trust funds is set to run out of assets in 2024, but incoming tax revenues would still cover more than 60 percent of projected costs for decades to follow, according to estimates released in April by the trustees overseeing the funds.The second trust fund is to remain on solid financial ground indefinitely, the trustees said.Runyan spokesman Drew Fasoli told us the congressman meant to say that Medicare as we know it would be gone and that as a consequence (there) could be a drop in the level of coverage.Now, lets discuss that fund in financial trouble.The Hospital Insurance (HI) Trust Fund covers Medicare Part A, which includes inpatient care at hospitals. The revenues behind that trust fund primarily come from payroll taxes.Any surplus revenues are credited to the trust fund in the form of government securities, which represents money the government owes itself. The trust fund also accounts for interest earned on those securities.Starting in 2008, there havent been enough revenues to fully cover Part A costs, leaving officials to make up the difference by redeeming those securities and spending interest earnings. That process is slated to continue until the fund is exhausted in 2024.Still, even after the HI trust fund is exhausted, tax revenues would still cover a portion of Part A expenses, starting at 87 percent of projected costs in 2024.The Trustees project that the share of HI expenditures that can be financed with HI dedicated revenues will decline slowly to 67 percent in 2045, and then rise slowly until it reaches 69 percent in 2086, according to the trustees.Its worth noting that the HI trust fund has faced a projected insolvency since nearly the time it was created, but lawmakers always have taken steps to prevent that from occurring.Due to a different type of financing, the accounts within the second fund, known as the Supplementary Medical Insurance (SMI) Trust Fund, will remain in financial balance for all future years, the trustees said.That trust fund covers Medicare Parts B and D. Part B includes outpatient care and Part D relates to prescription drug coverage. Medicare coverage provided through private health plans -- known as Medicare Part C -- is financed by both trust funds.The six trustees overseeing both funds include the Secretary of the Treasury; the Secretary of Labor; the Secretary of Health and Human Services; the Commissioner of Social Security; and two other members appointed by the president and confirmed by the U.S. Senate.Our rulingIn a May 4 interview on On the Record, Runyan claimed that as we sit right now, Medicare, if we do nothing, will be gone in eight years, if we do nothing to it.One of Medicares two trust funds is on track to no longer fully cover certain benefits, but the entire program is not facing extinction.Even after that trust fund is exhausted in 2024, tax revenues would still cover more than 60 percent of projected costs for decades to follow. The second trust fund is to remain financially sound indefinitely. To comment on this ruling, go to NJ.com.",0.5,0.7,1,0.4,0.2,0.6,0.5,1,0.5,Mostly False

HORRIFIC! the July 17 post says. Five Jet Blue Airlines pilots are confirmed dead, current Jet Blue whistleblower confirms push for jab continues — how is this SAFE for you and your loved ones? How is this about HEALTH when thousands are dying and they keep PUSHING this poison with coercion? The post shares a video of a talk show in which a guest says that a JetBlue pilot came forward to say that five JetBlue pilots passed away between February of this year and May. She says theres no direct information yet about their jab status but the shows host calls the deaths suspicious. This post was flagged as part of Facebooks efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) JetBlue told PolitiFact that it was aware of a report that mentions four of our pilots and one inflight crew member who have passed away this year, but said there is no connection in their deaths or to the COVID-19 vaccine. The social media video appears designed to intentionally deceive the public and should not be considered a trusted source of information, the company said. In 2020, JetBlues full-time staff included about 3,700 pilots and 4,300 flight attendants, according to its annual report. The names of people who died are given in the video in the post. We reviewed their obituaries and found no mention of COVID-19, a vaccine, or the coronavirus. The obituary of one of the men says he died of kidney cancer. The obituary of a second man says he died after a utility task vehicle accident. The family requested that people attending his memorial service wear masks to protect those who are immunocompromised, have health problems, and/or are vulnerable. The obituary for a third man, a JetBlue crew member, just says that he died unexpectedly, and obituaries for the other two men make no mention of cause of death. Searching more broadly online we found nothing to connect their deaths to the COVID-19 vaccine. We previously fact-checked a similar claim that the death of four British Airways pilots was connected to the COVID-19 vaccine. British Airways said the deaths werent connected to the vaccine. This one merits the same. The suggestion that the deaths of these JetBlue employees was caused by a COVID-19 vaccine is unfounded and in some cases contradicted by the available evidence.",0,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,False

Final Rating: False  ",Says Robert Hurt supports the tax loopholes that send American jobs overseas.,"Tom Perriello wants to know what Robert Hurt is hiding with his stance on tax loopholes, but the murkiness comes more from a cookie-cutter Democratic ad campaign than the Republican candidates position.In a political ad, What is Robert Hurt Hiding?, Perriello, a Democratic congressman from Charlottesville, claimed that Hurt, his Republican challenger from Chatham, supports the tax loopholes that send American jobs overseas.The basis of the claim is the Taxpayer Protection Pledge that Hurt signed in December after a much-publicized meeting with Grover Norquist, president of Americans for Tax Reform, a well-known anti-tax group in Washington. Hurt is one of seven challengers in Virginia congressional races -- six Republicans and one independent -- to take the pledge, which the anti-tax group enforces strictly.The pledge for House candidates has two parts: They promise to oppose any increase in marginal income tax rates for citizens or businesses, and they vow to oppose the elimination of tax deductions or credits unless they are offset dollar for dollar by tax cuts or new credits.Simple enough. But it has given Democrats an opening to make a dubious connection to tax credits they portray as loopholes for shipping American jobs offshore.The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee has translated the second part of the pledge to mean that signers support tax loopholes for multinational companies operating in other countries. The DCCC backs up the claim not with the pledge the candidates actually signed, but with three specific bills opposed by Americans for Tax Reform that the group urged pledge signers to oppose. One of them was the $26.1 billion bill adopted in August to help states hire teachers and pay for Medicaid services. The money for those programs would come from closing the loopholes. Hurt opposed that bill, citing the increase in federal spending.Democrats say the money from closing the loopholes was well-spent. Our point is if youre going to spend the money, it should be on creating jobs here, Jesse F. Ferguson, the DCCCs southern region press secretary, told us.But the fact that someone signed the pledge doesnt necessarily mean they are opposed to closing loopholes for off-shore companies.Our friends at FactCheck.org have been knocking down this claim since April, when the DCCC ran a TV ad against a Republican House candidate in Hawaii. They recently debunked the same claim in an ad in the Massachusetts gubernatorial campaign.Heres the problem: The taxpayer pledge doesnt prevent a signer from opposing any tax break as long as he or she finds a way to offset the resulting increase in taxes.The pledge doesnt get into whether something is good or bad tax policy, Ryan Ellis, ATRs director of tax policy, told us. The pledge means that if a bill would result in a net tax increase, youre not free to vote for it, Ellis said.Hurt hasnt offered specifics about his position on the offshore tax rules, but in a TV ad last month, he called Perriellos claim false.We agree. Perriello has chosen to rest his claim on the DCCCs spurious connection to the Taxpayer Protection Pledge, but that is a huge leap of logic and it doesnt prove Hurt supports the offshore loopholes. So we find the claim False.",0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,False

Final Rating: False ","Beginning on Jan. 1, prostitution by minors will be legal in California.","Did California really legalize child prostitution? Thats the startling question our audience asked after reading a misleading op-ed by Republican state Assemblyman Travis Allen in the Washington Examiner. Allens opinion piece has been shared widely on social media and led several readers to ask PolitiFact California to check it out. We decided to fact-check the first line of Allens column, which largely reflects the rest of the piece: Beginning on Jan. 1, prostitution by minors will be legal in California. Yes, you read that right. The op-ed is headlined: California Democrats legalize child prostitution. UPDATE: Allen repeated his claim on The O'Reilly Factor on Fox News on Jan. 4, 2017, saying at the end of his interview that The California Democrats did just legalize child prostitution in California.  Our research Last year, Gov. Jerry Brown signed into law Senate Bill 1322. It decriminalizes prostitution for minors by preventing law enforcement from arresting people under 18 for soliciting sex or loitering with intent to commit prostitution. Supporters of the law said its designed to treat children involved in prostitution as victims rather than as criminals. It does nothing, however, to legalize commercial sex acts. People caught having sex with minors, soliciting sex with minors or arranging clients for them can still be charged with crimes. The key is that the children involved are not liable, not that the conduct has been legalized, said Gabriel Chin, a criminal law professor at UC Davis School of Law, who analyzed the law upon our request. Chin added that under the new law child prostitution is treated just as, say, the production of child pornography is. Adults involved are subject to criminal prosecution, while the children, who are seen as victims, are not, he said. Representatives for Allen did not respond to our questions. Allen, who represents Orange County, told KQED public radio he rejects the criticism hes received over the column. I don't care about any amount of legalistic spin that someone wants to put on it. When you decriminalize something, you legalize it, Allen said in the radio interview. After his initial claim in the op-ed that prostitution by minors will be legal, Allen adds some factual context in his second line by noting law enforcement cant arrest underage workers for soliciting sex. A few paragraphs later, however, he wrongly asserts that the new law means law enforcement cant interfere with minors engaging in prostitution. The law, in fact, includes provisions that officers who encounter these minors shall report the circumstances to the county child welfare agency as abuse or neglect. It also authorizes officers to take a minor engaged in a commercial sex act into temporary custody under some circumstances, including in the event of immediate physical danger or when medical care is needed. Bills author responds Democratic state Sen. Holly Mitchell of Los Angeles, who authored Senate Bill 1322, responded on Twitter to the mischaracterizations of the law. I denounce false claims made by Republicans on my bill #SB1322 that decriminalizes sexually exploited minors, she wrote. I proudly authored SB 1322 to protect minor victims of human sex trafficking from being further charged as criminals for commercial sexual exploitation. This notion, perpetuated by Assemblymember Travis Allen (R-Huntington Beach), that my bill legalizes prostitution and commercial sex for minors is categorically untrue, she added. It remains unlawful for a person under the age of 18 to consent to sexual intercourse in the State of California and the law remains in effect and is not changed with the implementation of my bill.  California state Sen. Holly Mitchell responded to Allen's claims on Twitter. The Sacramento Bees fact-checking team PoliGRAPH also examined Allens op-ed. It described it as a misleading column and rated its assertions False. Our ruling California state Assemblyman Travis Allen claimed in a recent column that Beginning on Jan. 1, prostitution by minors will be legal in California. His claim profoundly distorts a new state law that treats minors engaged in commercial sex acts as victims, but does nothing to legalize prostitution. Young people under age 18 who solicit sex wont be arrested and sent to juvenile hall. Instead, officers will have the option of taking them into temporary custody if they are in immediate danger or need medical attention. It also says officers shall report the circumstances of minors engaged in prostitution to the county child welfare agency as abuse or neglect. The law does nothing to change the fact that it is illegal to have sex with minors, solicit prostitutes or arrange clients. Allens specific claim, and the column in general, is grossly misleading.

The move comes amid protests against police brutality and a national outcry to remove Confederate statues and symbols around the country. Now, a Facebook post is sharing an outrageous claim that the racing association forces its drivers to participate in Muslim prayer. It features a photo of a row of drivers kneeling down, bent over with their heads touching the floor. The caption reads: So NASCAR bans the confederate flag but FORCES all their drivers to do Muslim prayer? I wouldnt have believed it if I didnt see it with my own eyes. Unacceptable!! The post was flagged as part of Facebooks efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) This is bogus. NASCAR does not force its drivers to participate in Muslim prayer, or any other religious activity, and the photo displayed shows drivers taking part in a tradition called the kissing the bricks. The tradition takes place at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway's yard-length section of bricks called the Yard of Bricks and was started in 1996 by Dale Jarrett. After his Brickyard 400 victory, Jarrett and his crew walked out to the start-finish line and kissed the bricks. Since then, winners of various races at the speedway have done the same. A reverse-image search shows that the photo in the post was taken on July 24, 2016, when Kyle Busch won the Combat Wounded Coalition 400 at the speedway. Busch, his wife, and others took part in the tradition. A Facebook post that displays a photo of NASCAR drivers kneeling down kissing the floor claims that the racing association forces its athletes to participate in Muslim prayer, yet banned the confederate flag. This isnt true. NASCAR doesnt force or require drivers to partake in any religious activities.

Final Rating: False",Seniors around the world who died from COVID vaccine are being improperly listed as natural causes.,"Suggesting that coronavirus vaccinations killed 86-year-old Hank Aaron and elderly people in Gibraltar and Norway, an article widely shared on Facebook claims that seniors around the world died soon after getting vaccinated, and that their cause of death was listed as natural. Seniors dying after COVID vaccine labeled as natural causes, reads the headline of the article by Dr. Joseph Mercola, a major funder of anti-vaccine efforts. Mercolas work has come under criticism before from federal agencies and others within the medical community. The full article, which requires a registration to view, begins: Around the world, reports are pouring in of people dying shortly after receiving the COVID-19 vaccine.  Ironically, when seniors die before vaccination, its due to COVID-19 and something must be done to prevent it, but when they die after vaccination, they die of natural causes and no preventive action is necessary. The article was flagged as part of Facebooks efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The article relies on evidentiary assertions that have been widely discredited before. Lets look. The article says the death Jan. 22 of Aaron, the Hall of Fame baseball player, is notable because he died 17 days after he chose to be vaccinated publicly in hope that other Black people would get the shot. But the Fulton County (Ga.) Medical Examiners office said Aarons cause of death was natural and not linked to the vaccine. Health Feedback rated as misleading a separate assertion that Aarons death is part of a wave of suspicious deaths among elderly closely following administration of COVID vaccines. The nonprofit fact-checker said there is no evidence to back the claim. Mercolas article said a surge in deaths in Gibraltar after COVID-19 vaccinations began raises questions. The article said Gibraltar, the British overseas territory on the southern coast of Spain, had only 10 COVID-related deaths by Jan. 6. But vaccinations began Jan. 9 and by Jan. 17, the article claimed, the total death toll had suddenly skyrocketed to 45, with most of the people who died during that period being in their 80s or 90s. A Reuters fact-check said a claim that coronavirus deaths in Gibraltar have been caused by the vaccine and not the virus is false, saying there is no evidence linking the deaths to the vaccine. Full Fact reached the same conclusion. The government said in a statement Jan. 27 that 11,073 people had received a first dose of the Pfizer vaccine and none had died as a result of receiving it. Six people between the ages of 70 and 100 who died after receiving the vaccine apparently contracted COVID-19 before being vaccinated, but testing did not detect it, according to the statement. In a Feb. 1 announcement, the government encouraged people over age 60 to be vaccinated, noting that we have offered the vaccine to almost everyone over the age of 60. The article claimed the Norwegian Medicines Agency initially downplayed any connection between the deaths of 29 seniors citizens in the wake of Norways vaccination push — but that the agency is now reconsidering. Those who died were very frail nursing home residents with serious underlying illnesses. The inoculation was not determined to be the cause of death. Since then, in its latest weekly report on adverse reactions to the vaccinations, the agency said Feb. 2 that among the 112,000 people who have received the first dose and 22,000 who have received the second, there were 56 deaths with a temporal link to vaccination. All occurred among nursing home residents over age 70 within 12 days of vaccination. Many of these reports state that no link to vaccination is suspected. The fact that some nursing home residents die soon after being vaccinated does not mean that there is a causal relationship, the report said. Every day, an average of 45 people die in Norwegian nursing homes or other similar institutions. It is therefore to be expected that deaths will occur soon after vaccination, without there necessarily being any causal link to the vaccine. The agency also said in the report: The benefits of administering the vaccine are considered to outweigh any possible risks. A COVID-19 subcommittee of the Global Advisory Committee on Vaccine Safety, an advisory body to the World Health Organization, reviewed information on deaths reported in frail, elderly individuals in Europe who had received the Pfizer vaccine. In a statement Jan. 22, the subcommittee said, The current reports do not suggest any unexpected or untoward increase in fatalities in frail, elderly individuals or any unusual characteristics of adverse events. An article widely shared on Facebook claimed that seniors died soon after getting a COVID-19 vaccination and their cause of death was improperly listed as natural. The article cited the deaths of 86-year-old Hank Aaron and several dozen elderly people in Gibraltar and Norway, all of whom died within a couple of weeks of receiving a COVID-19 vaccination. There is no evidence that the vaccines caused any of the deaths. Aarons death was ruled natural, and authorities in Gibraltar and Norway said none of the deaths of elderly people they investigated were caused by the vaccines.",0,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,False

Final Rating: False  ","As soon as I endorsed (Supreme Court Justice Daniel Kelly), the Wisconsin Democrats said, lets move the election to two months later.","The mid-pandemic election in Wisconsin yielded no shortage of bizarre storylines. But a noteworthy one emerged late in the day when President Donald Trump tried to put himself at the center of a debate over whether the election should have even been held as scheduled. The April 7, 2020, contest featured a Democratic presidential primary and a Wisconsin Supreme Court race between conservative-backed Daniel Kelly and liberal-backed Jill Karofsky, as well as numerous local elections. At his daily briefing that day, Trump connected his endorsement of Kelly to Gov. Tony Evers last-minute attempt to change the election. The implication was Democrats thought theyd have a better chance of boosting Karofsky by extending the election period. Heres an excerpt of Trumps extended discussion on the topic: (Wisconsin Democrats) didn't want to move the election. As soon as I endorsed him, the Wisconsin Democrats say, Oh, let's move the election to two months later, three. They didn't mind having the election until I endorsed him, which is very interesting. So Trump is saying his endorsement caused Evers to try moving the election back two months. Lets take a closer look at that timeline. In case you lost track of the election back-and-forth, the basics are these: Evers had said for weeks he didnt have the authority to move the election on his own. Then on Friday — four days before the election — he called on the Republican Legislature to switch to an all-mail election that would allow votes to come in through May 19, 2020. He also ordered a special session of the Legislature for the following day to take up the matter. The state Assembly and Senate both gaveled out of that session in seconds, without taking action. Then, 18 hours before polls opened, Evers issued an order to delay the election to June 9, 2020. Republicans appealed to the Wisconsin Supreme Court, where the conservative majority overturned Evers order, clearing the way to hold the election. Trump is claiming his endorsement of Kelly was a pivotal moment in this back-and-forth. Trump sent a tweet at 12:12 p.m. April 3, 2020, saying Kelly has his complete endorsement. Evers call for a mail-in election was released about an hour later. But thats a coincidence. Heres why Trump is wrong. Evers call at that point was not to move the election by two months, but to switch the format to mail-in only and extend the deadline to May. The attempt to move the in-person election to June didnt come until several days later. And the Evers administration had been moving toward that mail-in announcement well before Trumps tweet, including calls to Republican leaders, said Evers spokeswoman Melissa Baldauff. But theres a much more glaring oversight from Trump. He had already endorsed Kelly several months earlier. At a rally in Milwaukee on Jan. 14, 2020, Trump urged his supporters to go vote for Justice Daniel Kelly to defend the rule of law. At that time, of course, coronavirus was barely a blip on the national radar. And it was the pandemic that fueled the back-and-forth over Wisconsins election, not a repeat of a prior endorsement. In a statement later on Election Day, Evers said Trump was not a factor in his decision-making. I dont pay any attention to who the president endorses, the governor said. Frankly, my focus right now is on keeping the people of this state safe, and thats why I issued an executive order to extend Wisconsins election date and make sure everyone could vote safely from home. Trump claims his endorsement of Kelly caused the Wisconsin attempts to push the election back until June. Thats not at all how it happened. Trump had already endorsed Kelly back in January. And in any case, the action from Evers that coincidentally followed Trumps reiterated endorsement on Twitter was to shift to a mail-in election, not to move the whole election by several months. That leaves us with a claim that is both false and ridiculous.",0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,False

Final Rating: False  ",Says Tammy Baldwin is more worried about the mastermind of 9/11 than supporting CIA director nominee Gina Haspel.,"Does U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin have so much more concern for a 9/11 terrorist, compared to the presidents nominee to run the CIA, that she would vote against the nominee? Its an attack that appears to question the Wisconsin Democrats patriotism. And if its correct, where is the evidence? The claim was made by Leah Vukmir, who is vying with fellow Republican Kevin Nicholson for the chance to run against Baldwin in November 2018. As stated, Vukmirs claim draws a conclusion based on what is publicly known about Baldwins stance toward Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, the mastermind of the Sept 11, 2001 terrorist attacks.  Lets examine if the evidence matches the rhetoric. Like us on Facebook. Follow us on Twitter: @PolitiFactWisc Team Terrorists Vukmir took flak, even from conservatives, when she branded Baldwin and Mohammed as Team Terrorists. But Vukmir then doubled-down and even tripled-down in a series of statements, including one that makes the claim we want to check. In a May 14, 2018 interview, Steve Scaffidi, a conservative talk show host on WTMJ-AM in Milwaukee, asked Vukmir to explain what you were trying to say in tying Baldwin to Mohammed. Vukmir alluded to Gina Haspel, the nominee of President Donald Trump to be director of the Central Intelligence Agency, and said: Tammy and her party are more interested, and theyre more worried about, the mastermind of 9/11 -- the individual that plotted and ultimately killed over 3,000 Americans on our soil. And shes more worried about those individuals than to support a very strong woman with a track record to be the head of the CIA. No evidence When Vukmir did the interview, it was expected that Baldwin would ultimately oppose Haspel. But Baldwin had not yet said whether she would vote for or against the nominee, who needs Senate confirmation to become CIA director. (Three days after the interview, Baldwin announced she'll vote against the nomination.) In any case, Baldwins support or opposition to Haspel is not what were fact checking here. When we asked Vukmirs campaign staff for evidence to support Vukmirs claim that Baldwin is more worried about Mohammed than supporting Haspel, it was lacking. Latest fact checks on the Senate candidates: Baldwin: 97 percent of gun owners support universal background checks. Mostly True. Nicholson: Baldwin cosponsored legislation that wanted to establish the Department of Peace and Nonviolence. Mostly True. Vukmir: Baldwin claims to support a 'Buy America' philosophy, but her actions speak louder than her empty words. False. We were referred only to a New York Times news article, published six days before Vukmirs interview. Vukmirs campaign said the article shows Mohammeds opposition to the nomination of Haspel, a career CIA officer. The article reported on Mohammeds request to share six paragraphs of unspecified information about Haspel with the Senate Intelligence Committee, before the committee voted to recommend Haspels confirmation. Mohammed had been captured in 2003 and tortured by the CIA. But it is not known whether Haspel was involved, directly or indirectly, in his torture, according to the article. Haspel has since declared that the agency should not have undertaken its interrogation program in which al Qaeda detainees were tortured after the Sept. 11 attacks, and is likely to be confirmed by the Senate, according to another Times news article. The article did not even mention Baldwin -- much less provide any evidence that Baldwin had any concern for Mohammed. About Baldwin For her part, when asked the day after Vukmirs interview about Haspel and Vukmirs Terrorist Team attack, Baldwin said on MSNBC she was on a third iteration of attempts to meet with Haspel. Two other points are worth noting: Baldwin did not call for Mohammeds testimony to be allowed by the Senate Intelligence Committee. (She is not a member of the panel.) In the days after 9/11, Baldwin, as a member of the House, voted for a measure overwhelmingly approved by Congress that gave the president authority to use force to invade Afghanistan in response to the 9/11 attacks. In short, Vukmir provided nothing of substance to support linking Baldwin with a terrorist. Our rating Vukmir says Baldwin is more worried about the mastermind of 9/11 than supporting Trumps nominee for CIA director. She provided no information to back up an extreme claim that Baldwin has serious concern for a terrorist that it is motivating her not to support the nominee.",0,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,False

Rick Scott policythat may need it least — drug-testing needy Floridians who apply for cash aid.Thenew law, signed by the governor May 31, 2011, got a thumbs-up from 71 percent of Floridians in aSeptember 2011 poll, including 90 percent of Republicans.Theviral e-mail messagelays it on thick, beginning:Great going, Florida. You set the stage for the other 49 States to join! Kudos to Republican Governor Rick Scott for having the correctness and guts to move forward on this critical issue !Hooray for Florida ! !I-95 will be jammed for the next month or so........Druggies and deadbeats heading North out of Florida ..Florida is the first state requiring drug testing to receive welfare!Our eyes lit upon the message's first factual claim: Florida is the first state requiring drug testing to receive welfare! Is this true?We asked some experts, but not before doing a quick Web search to see if we might find some of the message's genesis. At least three sentences of the chain e-mail, it turns out, appear to be lifted directly from a June New York Daily News article. But thatarticle doesn't address the claim we're checking, that Florida is the first state requiring drug testing to receive welfare.For that, we turned to the Florida Senate'sfinal analysis, theNational Conference of State Legislaturesand theAmerican Civil Liberties Union.Florida's law deals with part of what used to be known as welfare: It's a cash assistance program funded by federal block grants called Temporary Assistance for Needy Families. Back in 1996, as part of federal welfare reform, the government told states they could use drug testing as part of eligibility for the block grant programs. (On the other hand, they weren't allowed to add new hurdles for collecting food.) Florida's law requires applicants for cash aid to pay for their own drug tests. If they pass, the cost of the testing is added to their benefits. If they fail, they're disqualified from cash aid for a year, though with drug abuse treatment they can reapply in six months. The caseload is nowdown 11 percentfrom September 2010.Was Florida the first to try such testing, more than a decade after welfare reform?The answer is no. Michigan instituted mandatory drug tests for all welfare applicants — in 1999. But that kind of suspicionless testing, without any reason to believe people were using drugs in the first place, was struck down in 2003 by a Michigan appeals court. That discouraged other states. So while many have considered more drug-testing since the '90s, very few have passed laws, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures, a bipartisan group that represents state lawmakers. A 2002 survey, for example, showed that a handful of states — such as Maryland, Minnesota, New Jersey and Wisconsin — tested only people who have been convicted of a drug felony.Still, the proposals, sometimespitched as a cost-saving measure, are popular. In 2009, more than 20 states proposed requiring drug tests as a condition of eligibility for public assistance, according to NCSL. In 2010, at least 12 did. No laws emerged. But this year, with at least 36 states considering drug-testing proposals, three are now law. In addition to Florida's mandatory suspicionless testing, Arizona and Missouri now screen applicants they have reasonable cause to believe are taking illegal drugs, though Arizona's requirement is temporary.Meanwhile, Florida's law — the first requiring testing regardless of suspicion since Michigan's program was struck down — is under legal challenge. TheACLU has suedFlorida to stop what it considers unreasonable and suspicionless searches that violate the Fourth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. Our rulingIn 1996, Congress said states could test welfare recipients for illegal drug use. In 1999, Michigan was the first state to require all applicants to take drug tests, regardless of suspicion. But that law was struck down as unconstitutional, discouraging other states from requiring similar testing. This year, Florida became the first state to try mandatory drug screening of all applicants after Michigan's legal loss, while Arizona and Missouri enacted laws to test applicants they suspect might use drugs. A chain e-mail claims, Florida is the first state requiring drug testing to receive welfare! It is the first one — since the last one, which was Michigan. Meanwhile, other states also require drug-testing for some applicants. We rule this e-mail's claim False.",0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,False

Final Rating: Mostly False  ","Says Obama said black people have the worst jobs, the worst housing and face rampant police brutality, but when so-called black committeemen came around election time wed all line up and vote the straight Democratic ticket, sell our souls for a Christmas turkey.","A Facebook ad by a PAC supporting President Donald Trump distorts a statement in a book by President Barack Obama about African American voters. The ad by the Committee to Defend the President is entitled Enough Empty Promises and targets African American voters. Democrats promised to help our community, the narrator says. Promises they never kept. The ad then pivots to Obama: Here is President Obama: 'Plantation politics. black people in the worst jobs, the worst housing, police brutality rampant. But when the so-called black committeemen came around election time, wed all line up and vote the straight Democratic ticket, sell our souls for a Christmas turkey.'  The narrator then continues: Enough empty promises. President Trump promised us jobs and he delivered. Democrats dont care about us. The ad ran Nov. 8 largely in states with a significant African American population including Georgia, Michigan and Louisiana. Trump is trying to chip away at the wide margin by which African Americans vote for Democrats. His ad coincided with his Black Voices for Trump visit in Atlanta. (Judd Legum, who writes the newsletter Popular Information, tweeted about the ad the day it first started running.) The ad takes words from a book by Obama where he was talking from the perspective of someone else. It takes those words out of context and gives them a meaning they didnt have. Weve heard a similar ad before from a pro-Trump group. During a congressional election in Georgia in 2017, Great America Alliance ran a radio ad aimed at cutting African American turnout for Democrat Jon Ossoff. The voice in that and the current ad sounds like Obamas, but the words were not his own views. They came from Obama reading from his 1995 book Dreams From My Father about his days as a community organizer in Chicago. He recounted his conversation with a barber he called Smitty about Chicagos first black mayor, Harold Washington. Smitty explains Chicago politics to Obama, who told the barber he was not in Chicago for the election of Washington. Heres how the scene plays in the book: Had to be here before Harold to understand what he means to this city, Smitty said. Before Harold, seemed like wed always be second-class citizens. Plantation politics, the man with the newspaper said. Thats just what it was, too, Smitty said. A plantation. Black people in the worst jobs. The worst housing. Police brutality rampant. But when the so-called black committeemen came around election time, we'd all line up and vote the straight Democratic ticket. Sell our souls for a Christmas turkey. White folks spitting in our faces, and wed reward em with the vote. In his book, Obama then described the power of African Americans to shape their political destiny when they are unified. Obama wrote: They had turned out in record numbers on election night, ministers and gang-bangers, young and old. And their faith had been rewarded. In Smittys words, The night Harold won, let me tell you, people just ran the streets,. he said, recounting how the community was proud of Washington and themselves. When I woke up the next morning, it seemed like the most beautiful day of my life. The pro-Trump ad uses the passage to create the impression that Obama believed that black voters, ignored and suffering, sold their soul to the Democrats at election time. But the actual book passage is about the good things that come from voting. Chad Banghart, the executive director of the PAC, told us that he thinks it is clear that the ad is Obama reading from his book. However, the ad never states the context of Obamas words. Banghart also suggested that Smitty the barber was a fictional creation. In the introduction of the book, Obama wrote that for the sake of compression some of the characters are composites. He wrote that other than family or public figures, the names of most characters were changed to protect their privacy. The Chicago Tribune identified the location of the barber shop in 2008 and in this 2015 graphic. The ad also said that President Trump promised us jobs and he delivered. We found in August that the unemployment rates and poverty rates for African Americans are indeed at or near historical lows, as Trump indicated. However, there were also declines under Obama too. The text on the ad included attacks on four of the Democrats running for president: former Vice President Joe Biden and U.S. Senators Kamala Harris, Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders. These attacks related to Bidens record opposing school busing, Harris record as a prosecutor, Warrens statements identifying herself as Native American, and Sanders statements on reparations. A pro-Trump Facebook ad says that Obama said black people have the worst jobs, the worst housing and face rampant police brutality, but when so-called black committeemen came around election time wed all line up and vote the straight Democratic ticket, sell our souls for a Christmas turkey. While Obama did say those words, they were not his own. In his book Dreams from my Father, Obama was describing a conversation with a Chicago barber who remembered African Americans helping elect Chicagos first black mayor. The ad creates an impression that Obama said that Democrats ignored the perils faced by black voters and then black voters turned around and automatically voted for them anyway. In reality, a Chicago barber told Obama that, but then said the Chicago mayors race showed that turning out to vote can make a difference",0.5,0.9,1.0,0.6,0.7,0.8,0.5,1.0,0.4,Mostly False

Final Rating: False  ",Hillary Clinton leaves the country as Mueller indictment is announced.,"A story that said former Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton fled the United States after indictments were announced in Robert Muellers investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 election is fake news. An Oct. 29, 2017,, post on Morning-Herald.com ran with the headline, Hillary Clinton leaves the country as Mueller indictment is announced. The same story appeared on other websites, too.  Facebook users flagged the story as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social networks efforts to curb the spread of fake news. The fake post said that Clinton and her husband, former President Bill Clinton, flew to Lviv, Ukraine, on Oct. 27, which was the same day a grand jury approved criminal charges in the Special Counsels Office investigation. The announcement of who was actually being indicted didnt come until Oct. 30, giving fake news purveyors a couple of days to peddle false stories. The story originated on Oct. 28 at FreedomJunkshun.com, which had written a series of posts implying Hillary Clinton was a potential target of Muellers probe. The site included a photograph of the Clintons at an airport, but that image was from the 2013 renaming of the airport in Little Rock, Ark., after the political power couple. The story notes that Ukraine has no extradition treaties with the United States, which is true. And Hillary Clinton has been to Lviv, but that was as first lady 20 years ago. In reality, Hillary Clinton was in Washington on Oct. 28, not Ukraine, for a speech at the Human Rights Campaigns national dinner. She was then in the Chicago suburbs on Oct. 30 to sign copies of her new book, What Happened. FreedomJunkshun.com is a member of a series of fake websites associated with Christopher Blair, who lives in Maine. Blair is a self-described liberal troll who creates fictional stories to try to fool conservative readers. The website uses a similar layout and style as other Blair-affiliated sites, and carries a disclaimer that reads, All people, places, names and images should be considered fictitious or fictitious representations. The real indictments were for President Donald Trumps former campaign chairman Paul Manafort and his associate Rick Gates, who pleaded not guilty to 12 counts of making false statements, money laundering and more. George Papadopoulos, a former Trump foreign policy adviser, also was indicted for lying to the FBI and pleaded guilty. This is another in a spate of fake news stories that claimed Democrats were among the people charged in the Mueller investigation",0,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,False

Final Rating: False  ",Barack Obama wants to unilaterally disarm our nation.,"Anonymous e-mails claim that Sen. Barack Obama wants to unilaterally disarm our nation — and they say they have the video to prove it. You do not have to check Snopes to determine if this is true or false ... watch and listen to Obama's own words, warns one e-mail. Look at this ASAP — it may be pulled from the Obama Web site very soon, another e-mail states. This is shocking and reprehensible, opines a third e-mail. All the e-mails link to YouTube video that shows Barack Obama talking about his defense policies. The only problem is, Obama doesn't say in the video that he wants to disarm the United States. Rather, Obama talks about ending the war in Iraq, curtailing wasteful defense spending, and negotiating with Russia to reduce the U.S. nuclear arsenal. He says he wants a world without nuclear weapons, but as we'll explain shortly, that statement is well within the mainstream of U.S. foreign policy thought. We went looking for the source of the video and found it fairly quickly on the Obama campaign Web site. The official version includes opening and concluding remarks in which he emphasizes he will eliminate wasteful spending and make his sole priority protecting the American people. Obama's campaign created the video while campaigning to win the Iowa caucuses. Obama was seeking the endorsement of Caucus4Priorities, an Iowa-based advocacy movement that wants a portion of defense spending diverted to domestic issues like education and jobs. The group instead endorsed John Edwards. Here's Obama's statement in its entirety. We've noted where the edited version in the chain e-mails begins and ends: Thanks so much for the Caucus4Priorities, for the great work you've been doing. As president, I will end misguided defense policies and stand with Caucus4Priorities in fighting special interests in Washington. First, I'll stop spending $9-billion a month in Iraq. [Edited video starts.] I'm the only major candidate who opposed this war from the beginning, and as president, I will end it. Second, I will cut tens of billions of dollars in wasteful spending. I will cut investments in unproven missile defense systems. I will not weaponize space. I will slow our development of future combat systems, and I will institute an independent defense priorities board to ensure that the quadrennial defense review is not used to justify unnecessary spending. Third, I will set a goal of a world without nuclear weapons. To seek that goal, I will not develop new nuclear weapons. I will seek a global ban on the production of fissile material, and I will negotiate with Russia to take our ICBMs off hair-trigger alert and to achieve deep cuts in our nuclear arsenals. [Edited video ends.] You know where I stand. I've fought for open, ethical and accountable government my entire public life. I don't switch positions or make promises that can't be kept. I don't posture on defense policy, and I don't take money from federal lobbyists for powerful defense contractors. As president, my sole priority for defense spending will be protecting the American people. Thanks so much. We suspect that the phrase a world without nuclear weapons may have set off Obama's anonymous critics. Actually, that goal has been promoted by foreign policy experts on both sides of the political aisle. Obama's goal echoes an opinion piece published in theWall Street Journalon Jan. 4, 2007, authored by George P. Shultz, William J. Perry, Henry A. Kissinger and Sam Nunn. Its title: A World Free of Nuclear Weapons. The end of the Cold War made the doctrine of mutual Soviet-American deterrence obsolete, their essay said. Deterrence continues to be a relevant consideration for many states with regard to threats from other states. But reliance on nuclear weapons for this purpose is becoming increasingly hazardous and decreasingly effective. The piece then goes on to argue for similar points as Obama mentions in his statement, though in more detail. The authors have significant foreign policy experience: Shultz was was secretary of state under Ronald Reagan; Perry was defense secretary under Bill Clinton; Kissinger was secretary of state under Richard Nixon and Gerald Ford; and Nunn was chairman of the U.S. Senate Armed Services Committee. The piece kicked off enough discussion and debate in the foreign policy community that the quartet authored another piece for theWall Street Journala year later, titled Toward a Nuclear-Free World, in which they discussed growing support for their ideas. Not everyone agreed, of course. In May 2008, theWeekly Standardpublished a detailed critique of the policies by Gary J. Schmitt of the American Enterprise Institute and Henry Sokolski of the Nonproliferation Policy Education Center, who argued that their proposed solutions would be difficult to implement. For our fact-checking purposes, the point here is that Obama's statement falls firmly within the mainstream of the U.S. foreign policy debate. His position does not constitute unilateral disarmament, said John Pike, director of GlobalSecurity.org, a Web site that specializes in information about defense, the military, weapons of mass destruction and homeland security. He's advocating the abolition of nuclear weapons in general, not nuclear disarmament, Pike said. If you're going to disagree with him, you have to understand what you're disagreeing with. The notion of unilateral disarmament is pretty much a nonstarter for both major political parties, including Obama, he added. Outside of the religious pacifist community, that is just not a policy position that has had meaningful political support in the United States, Pike said. One of the outlets that has promoted the Obama-wants-to-disarm-us argument is the conservative blog Macsmind. Macsmind linked on Feb. 27, 2008, to a YouTube video; several of the e-mails we received linked to the Macsmind post. Macsmind posted the commentary, Sen. McCain, you should grab this video and play it on every ad you can. This is absolutely shocking reprehensible. He plans to universally disarm our nation (sic). The question is for what, and more specifically 'for whom'. On June 8, Macsmind posted a full version of the video, noting some lefties are complaining that the video is a hack job and it's out of context. Therefore I present to you context. Macsmind and others may not like the foreign policy goals that Obama outlines in his video, but it's deceptive to call those goals unilateral disarmament. For this reason, we find this the chain e-mail's statements to be False. ",0,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,False

Final Rating: False",(New Jersey Network) is the only news station which covers New Jersey government.,"Sen. Loretta Weinberg may need to do some more channel surfing for news about government in New Jersey.After Gov. Chris Christie announced plans in early June to turn over control of the 40-year-old New Jersey Network to New York-based television station WNET, Democratic legislators called for a closer examination of the proposal. Assembly Democrats on Thursday rejected Christie's plans, however. As a result, the fate of the public broadcasting network is in limbo.Weinberg, a Democrat who represents Bergen County, raised concerns about the deal in a June 6 column on Bluejersey.com, calling it a give-away of one of our state's greatest assets.Using bold and italics in the following statement, Weinberg went on to say: NJN is the only news station which covers New Jersey government. Their public affairs and interview shows as well as the nightly news will be no longer. We still don't have the detail on this, and once the state report is officially released, the Legislature will have 15 days to respond or the give-away is considered approved.The only news station covering New Jersey government? It didnt take long for PolitiFact New Jersey to realize Weinberg was wrong.We found stories about New Jersey government on the websites of television stations based in the New York and Philadelphia areas. Some stories were written by the Associated Press, but others were covered by reporters working for those stations or their affiliates.Secaucus-based My9 News also runs a weekly political talk show called New Jersey Now. In fact, Weinberg appeared on that program on Feb. 6 to discuss the Passaic Valley Sewerage Commission.News 12 New Jersey provides news coverage for cable subscribers in northern and central parts of the state, as well as its weekly show, Power and Politics, and its monthly Capital Hotseat interviews.While other stations cover the metropolitan areas, NJN and News 12 are comparable in the amount of time devoted to New Jersey news, according to Lawrence Londino, chair of the Department of Broadcasting at Montclair State University.Its certainly not the only game in town, said Londino, referring to NJN.Weinberg acknowledged in a phone interview that other stations provide news coverage and said she could have been more articulate in her statement. She maintained that NJN is the only network providing regular nightly news shows focused on New Jersey government.I knew what was in my mind, said Weinberg, before referring to News 12 New Jersey: Whatever news they cover is very sporadic.Janice Selinger, the acting executive director at NJN, also argued that News 12s coverage is not comparable to NJN.Other people do cover state government. They dont cover it as extensively as we do and they dont cover it for the whole state, Selinger said. Were not just there when the story breaks. Were there every day.The NJN News broadcast appears at three regular times each weekday night, and other news programs such as On the Record appear on weekends. News 12 New Jersey runs a live broadcast for a total of nine and a half hours each weekday, and then two live newscasts on Saturday and Sunday.In a statement, News 12 New Jersey General Manager and News Director Randal Stanley responded to Weinbergs comments.With a full-time news bureau at the State Capitol, News 12 is dedicated to providing New Jerseys communities and its local residents with daily coverage of events and issues on state government and other important topics, according to the statement. In addition, News 12's election season includes live coverage on election night, a schedule of political debates, live coverage of the State of the State address, plus inaugurations, town hall meetings, and more.Lets review:Weinberg said NJN is the only news station which covers New Jersey government, but other television stations clearly cover government in the Garden State through news and political talk shows.Weinberg later praised the extent of coverage provided by NJN, but her statement was not about comparing coverage among different news stations.

Final Rating: False  ",Harry Reids plan is basically giving the president a blank check.,"In a recent television interview, House Majority Leader Eric Cantor boldly predicted that Republicans in his chamber would unite to pass Speaker John Boehners plan to lift the nations debt ceiling.Cantor, R-7th, said House Republicans were concluding that Boehners plan is their best option to cut federal spending while ensuring, at least temporarily, that the U.S. continues to pay back its loans.Cantor dismissed as unacceptable the option of not increasing the $14.3 trillion debt limit by Aug. 2, when the nation will start running short of funds to pay its obligations. He was scornful of a proposal by Sen. Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., to raise the debt limit.Harry Reids plan is basically giving the president a blank check, giving him what he wants, a blind increase of the debt ceiling to spend the money the way he wants, Cantor said during a July 26 interview on Fox News.We wondered whether Reids plan really would present President Barack Obama a blank check -- a claim repeatedly made by Cantor and Boehner. First, a little background. Reids proposal would raise the debt ceiling by $2.7 trillion, enough to last until 2013. Boehners two-step planwould allow the limit to increase by $900 billion now and force Obama to seek a second hike before next years elections.Both proposals claim to cut spending by $1.2 trillion over the next 10 years. Neither plan seeks a tax increase. Boehner would require Congress to vote on a balanced budget amendment; Reid would not.We asked asked Megan Whittemore, Cantors deputy press secretary, to explain the majority leaders factual basis for calling Reids plan a blank check for Obama.We are confident that your readers will understand the common meaning of the metaphor of a `blank check, she e-mailed back to us. However, to help you along we first turn to About.com in the grammar section where you will find the following helpful.Whittemore pasted in a three-paragraph definition that began, A figure of speech is a rhetorical device that achieves a special effect by using words in distinctive ways. It said, among other things, that sometimes people rely on hyperbole to emphasize a point (`Im starving!).She also sent us two definitions of blank check. One, by Dictionary.com, defines it as unrestricted authority; a free hand.Another, by Wikipedia, says blank check in the figurative or metaphoric sense, is used (especially in politics) to describe a situation in which an agreement had been made that is open-ended or vague, and therefore subject to abuse.Whittemore noted that Boehners two-step plan would require Congress to hit spending-cut goals before Obama could ask Congress for the second increase in the debt. That, Republicans say, would put more pressure on Washington to reduce spending than Reids proposal, which would allow a larger, longer-lasting hike in the debt cap.We ran Cantors blank check analogy by four Washington policy analysts who are closely watching the debt ceiling debate. They were all perplexed by the statement and pointed out a simple reason why Reids plan would not give Obama carte blanche: Under the U.S. Constitution, only Congress can appropriate money.Congress has to authorize new spending and changes in taxation, said Norman J. Ornstein, a political scientist with the conservative American Enterprise Institute. The president can sign or veto those bills. He cant do anything without congressional authority.Ornstein added, Cantor is being totally, deliberately misleading.Steve Ellis, vice-president of the non-partisan Taxpayers for Common Sense, had a similar take. Rep. Cantors comment isnt really correct, he said.We were also given a second reason why Cantors statement is inaccurate: Raising the debt limit will pay for past obligations made by the U.S. government, not new ones.The need to raise the debt limit is a factor of past spending and tax decision (in addition to the recent economic downturn) enacted by previous congresses and presidents pushing borrowing needs up, said Jason Peuquet, an analyst with the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a middle-of-the-road, budget-hawk group.Lets review:Cantor said Senate Majority Leader Reids proposal to raise the debt ceiling would be basically giving the president a blank check, giving him what he wants, a blind increase of the debt ceiling to spend the money the way he wants.A number of policy analysts told us Cantors statement is simply incorrect. Only Congress can appropriate money. Obama can only spend what hes given. Reids plan does not change that constitutional requirement.Cantors office failed to provide a single fact to back the Republicans contention that Reids proposal would give the president a free hand in spending. Cantors spokeswoman said he was speaking metaphorically and people understand that. We find that logic hard to accept, particularly at a time of great public divide when the financial integrity of the nation is at stake.",0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,False

Final Rating: False","In Japan, permanent residency is not given to Muslims, the propagation of Islam is banned, one cannot import a Koran published in the Arabic language, and Muslims cannot even rent a house.","Amid rising concerns about terrorist attacks by ISIS, weve seen an uptick in chain emails and viral images about Islam. One viral image points to Japan as an example of a country that keeps out radical Islam by cracking down on all forms of Islam and its adherents, implying that this is a good model for the United States to follow. The graphic is a simple black-and-white block of text with the headline, Japan keeps Islam at bay by putting restrictions on Islam and ALL Muslims. The graphic then mentions a variety of ways in which Japan supposedly keeps tight control over the Muslims in its midst: • Japan is the only nation that does not give citizenship to Muslims • Permanent residency is not given to Muslims • Propagation of Islam in Japan is banned • In the University of Japan, Arabic or any Islamic language is not taught • Japan is the only country in the world with a negligible number of embassies in Islamic countries • One cannot import a Koran published in the Arabic language • Muslims must follow Japanese law and language. • The Japanese government is of the opinion that Muslims are fundamentalist, and unwilling to change their Muslim laws • Muslims cannot even rent a house in Japan • There is no sharia law in Japan We wondered whether the graphic is accurate. To streamline our analysis, we focused mostly on these four claims -- that in Japan, permanent residency is not given to Muslims, the propagation of Islam is banned, one cannot import a Koran published in the Arabic language, and Muslims cannot even rent a house.  We heard back from three experts who have experience with the intersection of Japan and Islam, and all three said the graphic is blatantly incorrect. The chain email is nothing but malicious falsehood, said Kumiko Yagi, a professor at the Tokyo University of Foreign Studies Graduate School who has written extensively about Islam and other religions. Kamada Shigeru, a professor of Islamic studies at the University of Tokyo, agreed, saying that all four of the claims we spotlighted are wrong. He said Japan doesnt discriminate in permanent residency on the basis of religion and that propagation of Islam is not banned. He added that the Koran or other religious books in Arabic can be imported. As for renting a residence, he said there may be some reluctance among residents of Japan to rent apartments to foreigners as a general rule, but he said theres no specific animus toward Muslims. These four claims are totally unfounded, said Glenda S. Roberts, a professor of cultural anthropology and Japanese studies at the graduate school of Asia-Pacific Studies at Waseda University in Tokyo. It is disturbing that such an email is circulating, she added. These claims are simply ridiculous. Other claims in the graphic are easily debunked. For instance, the graphic claims that Japan is the only country in the world with a negligible number of embassies in Islamic countries. Yet a quick visit to the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs website shows that Japan has embassies in such countries as Afghanistan, Bahrain, Iran, Iraq, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Syria, Turkey, the United Arab Emirates and Yemen, plus a permanent representative to the Palestinian Authority. Meanwhile, there is nothing in Japanese nationality law that prevents Muslims from becoming naturalized citizens. The requirements concern length of residency, age, a history of upright conduct, the ability to support oneself and a willingness to give up other nationalities. There is no mention of religion. As for universities not teaching Arabic, we found that the Tokyo University of Foreign Studies does. Classes in Arabic are also taught at the Arabic Islamic Institute in Tokyo. Last year, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe made clear Japans respect for people of the Islamic faith during an event with the Islamic diplomatic corps. I have found that a fundamental aspect of the spirit of Islam is harmony with and love for others, Abe said. I believe therein lie points of commonality with the Japanese spirit, which is founded on co-existence. Our ruling The graphic says that in Japan, permanent residency is not given to Muslims, the propagation of Islam is banned, one cannot import a Koran published in the Arabic language, and Muslims cannot even rent a house. Each of these four statements is incorrect, and the overall point of the graphic -- that Japan keeps itself free from radical Islam by discriminating against all Muslims -- is dramatically off-base.",0,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,False

Final Rating: False  ",Forty percent of the guns in this country are sold without any background checks.,"Like many other politicians before him, U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., repeated a false claim that 40 percent of guns are sold without a background checks. We have to end the absurdity of the gun show loophole, Sanders said Feb. 18 on NBCsMeet the Press. Forty percent of the guns in this country are sold without any background checks. Three years after we first debunked this statistic, its still not true. The statistic comes from a 20-year-old study by the National Institute of Justice that looked at gun owners responses to a 1994 national survey asking how they got their weapons. The study found that 30 percent to 40 percent of all gun transactions were made through an off-the-books transfer in which a background check wasnt required. The finding has been cited widely by gun control advocates. Former Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe earned a Mostly False when he used it, and a Florida gun control advocate earned a False in 2017 after the finding was diminished by new research. The latest researchsuggests the percentage is almost half of what Sanders cited. The sample size of the 1997 study was very small, with just 251 participants. Furthermore, the statistic stems from survey data that included firearms given as gifts or inheritances, not just sales. This is an important point. When the authors of the NIJ study — Jens Ludwig of the University of Chicago and Philip Cook of Duke University — adjusted the results to include only the guns sold (not given), the number sold without background checks declined to between 14 percent and 22 percent. That statistic more closely resembles the new findings in a relatively new 2017 study. Researchers Matthew Miller, Lisa Hepburn, and Deborah Azrael published a study in the January 2017 edition of the journal Annals of Internal Medicine that was specifically undertaken to update the 1994 data. The researchers asked 1,613 adult gun owners where and when they acquired their last firearm, including whether it was purchased, and whether they had either a background check or were asked to show a firearm license or permit. The answer: 22 percent obtained their gun without a background check. Thats about half of the 40 percent figure that has gained wide currency for more than two decades. In fact, Cook wrote an accompanying editorial in the journal, headlined, At last, a good estimate of the magnitude of the private-sale loophole for firearms. In it, he wrote, Even though I bear some credit (or blame) for the earlier estimate, I could not be more pleased to be done with it, given that it is based on data from a survey done more than 20 years ago and that, in any event, never directly asked participants about background checks. It appears the number he cited may be outdated, Sanders spokesman Josh Miller-Lewis told PolitiFact Florida in an email. But whether its 40 percent or 22 percent of guns being acquired without a background check, millions of Americans still obtain guns without background checks. That's absurd. No one should be allowed to purchase a gun without a vigorous background check. Sanders said, Forty percent of the guns in this country are sold without any background checks. That statistic is outdated. It stems from a 20-year-old survey that has been overtaken by another study that shows that 22 percent of gun buyers obtained their weapons without background checks. Thats just over half the percentage in the zombie claim Sanders cited.",0.0,0.9,1.0,0.5,0.0,0.5,0.7,0.9,0.8,False

Final Rating: Mostly False  ",Says challenger Dominic Chavez is a Rick Perry Republican lobbyist.,"In a mailer we spotted May 8, 2012, Austin City Council member Bill Spelman urges recipients not to be fooled by a challenger.Republican lobbyist Dominic Dom Chavez is a Rick Perry Republican, Spelman says, also asking whether we really want Chavez to push a Rick Perry agenda for Austin on the council.Chavez works for a state agency guided by a board of Perry appointees. Is he also a Republican lobbyist and Perry man?Spelmans campaign consultant, David Butts, told us by telephone that Chavez once registered with the state as a lobbyist for the Real Estate Council of Austin, whose mission includes advocacy for the commercial real estate industry.Its not a Republican Party group. Reminded too that the mailer does not say Chavez used to be a lobbyist, Butts said: Once a lobbyist, always a lobbyist.We wondered how to define a Perry Republican, speculating that might be signaled by regular or hefty campaign contributions to Perry, participation in his campaigns as a staff member or volunteer or maybe through an appointment to a board.Research showed that Chavez does not qualify on any of those grounds.As backup for Spelmans claim, Butts said Chavez has mostly voted in Republican primaries and he suspects Chavez voted for Perrys 2010 re-election. Also, he said, Chavezs comments as a staff spokesman for the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board, entrusted with coordinating programs offered by state colleges and universities, show hes aligned with the long-time governor.Armed with Butts offerings, we turned to Chavez, who told us he was previously a lobbyist for a non-partisan group while he has voted in both party primaries. I dont call myself a Republican, Chavez said. I have voted for Democrats and Republicans. I would consider myself a fiscal conservative and Independent.Chavez told us in a telephone interview that he registered as a lobbyist at the Texas Ethics Commission to represent the real estate council in the 2005 legislative session, and also lobbied for the council at the city and Travis County government while working in its government affairs section in 2001-02 and from 2003 to 2007, when he went to work for the coordinating board, where he is now the senior external relations director.A Chavez filing on the ethics commissions website confirms termination of his lobbyist registration covering 2005, while another document there lists Chavez as a lobbyist from Jan. 26, 2005 through the end of that year. Neither one specifies who he represented, but the address written on the form is the real estate councils downtown address.By telephone, real estate council official Nancy McDonald confirmed that Chavez lobbied city government for the group. She said the group did not endorse gubernatorial candidates through his time there and did not endorse Austin City Council candidates either. Next, we verified Chavezs primary voting history.A word: Texas has open primaries, meaning any voter may participate in either the Democratic or Republican primary, though once a voter joins a primary, they cannot vote in the other partys runoffs. Unlike some other states, too, Texas does not require a voter to register their political affiliation. So individuals may vote in one primary or the other without explanation.Chavez said that he voted in Travis Countys 2002 Democratic primary and voted in the 2006, 2008 and 2010 Republican primaries. He said he did not vote in any 2004 primary. That information matched what Butts told us and also a check of voting records on our behalf by Austin political consultant Jeff Smith, who said Chavez registered to vote in the county in 2001. Chavez later told us said he previously voted in California elections.Calling himself a strategic voter, Chavez said he voted in the 2002 Democratic primary to support a Travis County commissioner, Karen Sonleitner, and voted in the 2006 Republican primary to back a Texas House hopeful with a focus on veterans issues, Bill Welch. Similarly, Chavez said, he voted in the 2010 GOP primary to support a friend seeking a House seat, Paul Workman.He said he could not recall why he voted in the 2008 Republican primary but remembers voting for the Republican presidential nominee, U.S. Sen. John McCain of Arizona, that November. He said he has not decided if hes voting in a 2012 primary.Chavez has not been a Perry campaign donor, according to a search of campaign finance reports on the ethics commission website, nor has he given a great deal to anyone.The search indicates that Chavez ponied up less than $260 from mid-2004 through early 2012, spread among a Republican House candidate and four political entities not tied to either party. Welch fielded a $37.36 contribution from Chavez on Oct. 4, 2006; the Building Owners and Managers Association of Austin political action committee fielded $100 on Aug. 3, 2004; and the Small Business PAC took in $104, in two Chavez donations, in May 2006. Finally, Chavez paid $16 to the Northwest Austin Republican Women on April 2, 2012, which Chavez told us paid for lunch one day.Chavez, a former Army reservist, volunteered one Perry link; he and Perry posed for a photo when the governor visited Texas troops in Iraq. Sending us the 2009 photo, Chavez wrote: We were all proud Texans and he was our governor taking time to visit troops in Iraq. No one cared about political party or politics for an event like this.Chavez said too he has not always voted for Perry.He said he could not remember who he voted for in the 2002 election won by Perry. But in November 2006, he said, he voted for Carole Keeton Strayhorn, who ran against Perry as an Independent after winning state office as a Republican. Chavez said he voted for Perry in November 2010, but is unsure if he supported him while casting his ballot in that years contested GOP gubernatorial primary. Im not even sure I voted on the offices at the top of the primary ballot, he said.Butts also offered May 2012 messages from the Williamson County and Travis County Republican parties mentioning Chavezs council candidacy and articles in which Chavez was quoted on behalf of the coordinating board.Williamson Countys Republican Party invited members to attend a May 3 social hour. The posting says Chavez and two other local candidates had confirmed plans to be there and two other council candidates, not identified, had been invited. Butts told us Spelman was not invited.Bill Fairbrother, who chairs the Williamson County GOP, said in a telephone interview that he heard before the event that Chavez is Republican-friendly, though he did not verify that. Informed that Chavez had voted in three of the last four Republican primaries, Fairbrother said that pattern for anyone would suggest he or she leans Republican, though he said some Republicans would say it takes voting in four or five consecutive GOP primaries to cement that.The message from Rosemary Edwards, who chairs the Travis County GOP, urges recipients to vote for Chavez and challengers for two other council seats. Her message calls the three the more conservative candidates.Andy Hogue, a party spokesman, told us by telephone that the message went out about May 6, 2012. Hogue pointed us to Roger Borgelt, the county partys vice chairman, who told us by phone that he doesnt consider Chavez a Republican partly because he has not been a local Republican precinct chair, election judge or the like. Borgelt also parted with Fairbrothers leans Republican analysis, saying he would want to know more about a person before concluding they fit in that barrel.The news articles show Chavez talking about Perry and higher education; one quotes Chavez talking about an executive order from Perry announcing a partnership between the state and the online Western Governors University.Another story, in the August 28, 2011 Daily Campus, Southern Methodist Universitys student newspaper, quotes Chavez, again on behalf of the agency, saying that Texas had made great strides with a greater share of residents enrolled in college, including more minority students, and more students proving ready for college, based on test scores. Also offered by Butts: A Jan. 27, 2012, news article published in the Austin American-Statesman quoting Chavez as an agency spokesman pointing out Perrys call for Texas universities to develop $10,000 degree programs.Our rulingChavez voted in the three latest GOP primaries. He voted for Perry in the 2010 general election, he says, though he also says he preferred another gubernatorial candidate in 2006. Keeping in mind that no one in Texas has to register a political affiliation, its reasonable to speculate about his partisan leaning, but theres no certainty in that. And he calls himself an Independent.Chavez mentions Perry in his state job, as Spelmans camp points out. But it strikes us a stretch to presume that someone who speaks for an agency and references the governors initiatives or positions is automatically a Perry acolyte. If that were so, then every spokesman or spokeswoman for every agency could be judged the same. Thats unshown.We can see why someone might suspect Chavez of being a Republican and maybe even a Perry fan. But we see no proof.Finally, Chavez once lobbied for a non-partisan group and not Republicans, contrary to Spelmans statement, which also leaves the inaccurate impression that Chavez is a lobbyist now. Its been years since he lobbied.",0.5,0.7,0.8,0.4,0.2,0.6,0.5,0.9,0.5,Mostly False

Final Rating: Half True  ","In three days last week, (Gov. Rick) Perry flew to five cities at taxpayers expense, holding press conferences, delivering $2,325,000 in checks.","In a Facebook post Wednesday, Democratic gubernatorial nominee Bill White suggests Gov. Rick Perry wasted government dollars flying to Texas cities to give out money. In three days last week, Perry flew to five cities at taxpayers expense, holding press conferences, delivering $2,325,000 in checks, Whites 8:43 p.m. post states. Did Perry burn tax dollars to hand out checks? Katy Bacon, Whites spokeswoman, pointed out news releases issued by the governors office reflecting Perrys stops May 11-13 in Corpus Christi, Dallas, San Antonio, Palacios and San Juan. The releases state that Perry announced spending awards of $150,000, $175,000 and $2 million, respectively, in Dallas, Palacios and San Juan. Perry did not ballyhoo funding awards in the other cities, according to the releases. Thats close to what White said on Facebook: Three days, five cities, $2,325,000 in checks handed over by Perry. We wondered, though, at Whites description of Perrys flights as costing taxpayers. For years, Perry has funded considerable out-of-town travel, for state business or campaign purposes, from non-state sources including his campaign kitty — an approach often mentioned in news articles, including a July 26 report in Whites hometown newspaper, the Houston Chronicle. The Chronicle article quotes Perrys gubernatorial spokeswoman, Allison Castle, noting that Perry's travel is not paid by taxpayers. It continues: Texas One, a corporate-finance foundation, pays for much of Perry's business development travel. Other travel is paid for by his political committee or campaign donors. And some is financed as in-kind contributions from specific wealthy donors or interest groups. As for the flights Facebooked by White, Bacon told us in an e-mail: These were all official trips and events under the Office of the Governor, and this type of travel is typically paid for by taxpayers. Not so, said Castle, who informed us the flights under fire, on private planes, were funded by Perrys campaign. The majority of the governors travel is paid for by his campaign, she said. For each of the five stops referenced by White, she said, one state-paid travel aide and a press aide accompanied Perry. There is another cost the public pays for every Perry trip — his security detail. In a follow-up interview, Bacon took no issue with gubernatorial security expenses. Bacon also stood by White's characterization of the travel as taxpayer-funded, saying it would take time to confirm, with documents, that Perry's flights were not paid for by the state. Then again, Bacon said, spending campaign funds on the flights also doesn't pass muster. Either way, this is wrong, she said. Hes running around handing out taxpayer dollars to get headlines for his political career. Hes using campaign dollars to hand out state checks. She showed us that Perry's campaign excerpted two press releases from the latest trips in a campaign e-mail blast. Bacon's charge shifts the focus from who paid for Perry's trips to the purpose of his stops. That's not what White critiqued on Facebook. All in all, White got several things right — five cities visited, press events, money awards. And it's true the state pays some costs any time the governor goes anywhere. But White's crucial assumption — that Perry's flights were at taxpayers' expense — is wrong. It's a misstep the candidate might have avoided by reading his local newspaper.

Final Rating: Mostly False  ","There is no disagreement that we need action by our government, a recovery plan that will help to jump-start the economy.","There's plenty of debate about how to respond to the economic crisis, but you wouldn't know that from the comments of President Obama and fellow Democrats. Economists from across the political spectrum agree that if we don't act swiftly and boldly, we could see a much deeper economic downturn that could lead to double-digit unemployment and the American dream slipping further and further out of reach, Obama said in his weekly address on Jan. 3, 2009. Every economist from right to left, Republican, Democrat, advises that (a government stimulus) has to be a very substantial package, said Democratic Congressman Steny Hoyer of Maryland on Jan. 4. There's no disagreement that we need action by our government — a recovery plan that will help to jump-start the economy, Obama said at news conference on Jan. 9. Everybody, I think, from economists on the left to economists on the right realize that we must make critical investments at this time, said White House chief of staff Rahm Emanuel on Jan. 18. The libertarians at the Cato Institute got weary of this line of argument and took out a newspaper ad in the  New York Times  on Jan. 28, 2009. With all due respect Mr. President, that is not true, the ad said. More government spending by Hoover and Roosevelt did not pull the United States economy out of the Great Depression in the 1930s. More government spending did not solve Japan's 'lost decade' in the 1990s. As such, it is a triumph of hope over experience to believe that more government spending will help the U.S. today, the ad says. Lower tax rates and a reduction in the burden of government are the best ways of using fiscal policy to boost growth. The Cato ad has 203 signatories, including three recent Nobel Prize winners. We talked to one of the Nobel winners, Edward Prescott of Arizona State University, who won in 2004, about Obama's plan. I agree with his wants, but just because you want something, that doesn't make it happen, Prescott said. I guess he thinks that everything can be solved by people's goodwill and good actions coming from Washington, D.C. Prescott advocates for a permanent reductions of the income tax or, failing that, nothing. I hope Obama succeeds, but benign neglect is a good policy, he said. Before we go much further, we should point out that there are many economists who  do  believe a stimulus is needed, and yesterday. For what it's worth, the most recent recipient of the Nobel for economics, Paul Krugman, supports the stimulus and has written about how wrong the opponents are. Conservatives really, really dont want to see a second New Deal, and they certainly dont want to see government activism vindicated. So they are reaching for any stick they can find with which to beat proposals for increased government spending, Krugman wrote recently in  his New York Times column  . Far be it from us to referee a knife fight between Ph.D. economists. But for those who are interested in how economists deal with facts, we would point you to the very interesting blog and podcasts of  economist Russell Roberts  of George Mason University. Roberts also opposes the stimulus bill, though he did not sign the Cato ad. Roberts said that economists actually agree on lots of things, but when it comes to big, new problems like the recent crisis, things get complicated. It's difficult to look back in history and pinpoint exact causes for economic turnarounds. We're trying to tease out the effect of one social policy in the face of hundreds of thousands of other changes, he said in a podcast on the role of  empirical evidence and bias  in economics. So where does that leave us for our ruling? We can't tell you which side is right on the stimulus bill. But we do know that Obama is wrong when he says there is no disagreement that we need action by our government. Clearly, there is disagreement.",0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,Mostly False

Final Rating: False  ","In the weekend after the terrorist attacks in Paris, the White House said this couldn't happen in the United States. ISIS couldn't reach us here.","President Barack Obama seems clueless on the threat of the Islamic State, said MSNBCs Joe Scarborough. First of all he wont even call it Islamic radicalism, Scarborough said on Morning Joe Dec. 4, the day after the deadly terrorist attack in San Bernardino, Calif. His White House said, the weekend of Paris, that this couldn't happen in the United States. ISIS couldn't reach us here. Its accurate that Obama doesnt call ISIS Islamic radicalism or Islamic extremism. A reader asked us to look into the second part of Scarboroughs statement: that in the days following the Friday, Nov. 13 terrorist attack in Paris, the Obama administration said an ISIS attack couldnt happen in the United States. An MSNBC spokesperson directed us to comments made by Ben Rhodes, a deputy national security adviser, on ABCs This Week on Nov. 15. But they dont back up Scarboroughs claim in the least. In the interview, Rhodes said there was no known credible threat to the United States at that moment. He did not say there wasnt any possibility of ISIS-backed terrorism on U.S. soil whatsoever. Rhodes immediately followed up by pointing out that ISIS has aspirations to attack the United States. Host George Stephanopoulos: And is there any intelligence suggesting a specific and credible threat to the homeland? I know yesterday there was none. Has anything new developed there? Rhodes: No, George, the president had a meeting yesterday that included the secretary of Homeland Security, the director of the FBI. Our determination is there's not a specific, credible threat to the homeland at this time. But we're going to be very vigilant because we know ISIL has the aspirations to attack the United States as well as our European and other allies and partners. Rhodes added later that one focus of Obamas meetings with foreign leaders that weekend was how we can seal that border with Turkey to prevent that flow of foreign fighters and share intelligence to disrupt and prevent attacks in our European allies' countries and, of course, in the United States. So this Rhodes interview doesnt support Scarboroughs point; rather, Rhodes plainly admits that there is a threat of an ISIS attack in the United States. We looked at other White House statements from around that time and didnt find anything else to back Scarborough up. Obama delivered a brief statement on Nov. 13 about the terrorist attack in Paris, but he did not address the possibility of terrorist attacks in the United States. At that time, ISISs involvement was unclear. In Nov. 15 remarks in Ankara, Turkey, Obama expressed solidarity with France and spoke about the fight against ISIS in the Middle East but did not discuss the potential for attacks in the United States. In a Nov. 16 press conference, also in Turkey, Obama delivered a similar message, but he also explicitly addressed the possibility of terrorist attacks on our soil. There are certain advantages that the United States has in preventing these kinds of attacks. Obviously, after 9/11, we hardened the homeland, set up a whole series of additional steps to protect aviation, to apply lessons learned. Weve seen much better cooperation between the FBI, state governments, local governments. There is some advantages to geography with respect to the United States. But, having said that, weve seen the possibility of terrorist attacks on our soil. There was the Boston Marathon bombers. Obviously, it did not result in the scale of death that we saw in Paris, but that was a serious attempt at killing a lot of people by two brothers and a crockpot. And it gives you some sense of, I think, the kinds of challenges that are going to be involved in this going forward. So in the weekend immediately following the Paris attacks, it doesnt seem that any White House official dismissed the possibility of an ISIS attack on U.S. soil. Our ruling Scarborough said that in the weekend after the terrorist attacks in Paris, the White House said this couldn't happen in the United States. ISIS couldn't reach us here. Obama and Rhodes, an adviser, both spoke of the Islamic States aspirations to attack the United States in the two or three days following the Paris attacks. They talked about what the government is doing to prevent the group from carrying out its plans. Neither ruled out the possibility that ISIS could stage an attack on U.S. soil, nor did any other White House official.",0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,False

Final Rating: False  ","Since 1965, the United States has spent untold trillions yet the poverty rate hasnt budged.","On July 26, 2011, Fox News host Bill OReilly took aim at government efforts to aid the poor, suggesting that they were not only a contributor to the nations current debt problems but that they also werent effective on their own terms.What the debt situation is really, really all about is your right to pursue happiness, OReilly said. America is the greatest country on earth because it gives the most people the most opportunity to prosper. It does that by using the free marketplace whereby people can work hard, make money and provide for themselves and their families.But since the mid-1960s, America has practiced social engineering. Spending tax money directly, trying to improve the lives of those who don't have very much. Those payments are called entitlements. And they are now so high they threaten to bankrupt the entire nation. Liberal Americans tend to support the entitlement society while conservatives are more inclined to promote individualism and smaller entitlement spending.President (Barack) Obama, of course, is a liberal. And the Democratic Party is now dominated by the left. That's why in the past two and a half years federal spending has broken the bank. ...The essential mistake that Barack Obama is making is that he believes Lyndon Johnson's Great Society entitlements can elevate the poor to prosperity. They can't. In 1965, the poverty rate in this country stood at 14 percent. Now, after untold trillions have been spent fighting poverty, the poverty rate is 14.3 percent. Amazing, is it not? The conclusion, America is bankrupting itself with an entitlement philosophy that does little.A reader asked us to look at OReillys statement. It covers a lot of ground, but the part we were interested in analyzing was his claim that since 1965, the United States has spent untold trillions, yet the poverty rate hasnt budged.First, some background on the Great Society. It was an agenda put forward by Johnson after he was elevated to president upon the assassination of President John F. Kennedy. He was able to enact various parts of the agenda after winning a landslide victory in 1964. It included such ongoing programs as Medicare, Medicaid, the Elementary and Secondary Education Act; and Head Start. It also included such defunct efforts as the Office of Economic Opportunity, which spearheaded localized anti-poverty efforts.Gary Burtless, an economist with the centrist-to-liberal Brookings Institution, cautions that OReillys comment overlooks the actual purpose of the Great Society programs, which wasnt to boost incomes directly, in a way that would be detectable in poverty statistics, but rather to improve the health care, nutrition and educational attainment or performance of Americans.If the programs were successful, Burtless said, it was because they improved the health care received by the old and poor, they improved the schooling received by disadvantaged youngsters and they improved the nutritional quality of the diets of the poor. These programs may eventually have reduced money poverty, but only if improving medical care, educational attainment and nutritional intake has an indirect effect that reduces money poverty.That said, well take OReillys statement on its own terms and offer our critique.• He uses the wrong numbers. The poverty rate -- the percentage of Americans whose income is lower than the federally determined poverty line -- was 17.3 percent in 1965, not 14 percent. For 2009, OReilly is correct -- the rate was 14.3 percent.So if you compare the poverty rate in those two years, it has fallen by 3 percentage points, or by about one-sixth its original level. It didnt stay roughly constant, as OReilly claimed.• The poverty rate has fallen even further if you start counting a few years before the Great Society began. Between 1959 and 1962, the poverty rate ranged between 20 and 22 percent. If you compare that level to 2009, poverty declined by an even steeper rate -- by more than one-third.• The most recent recession has affected the numbers. We have no quarrel with O'Reilly using the 2009 figure as his endpoint -- its the most recent figure available -- but as long as he has chosen it, well provide some important context. That year came within the midst of the Great Recession, and recessions typically lead to spikes in poverty.By simply moving the endpoint two years earlier, to 2007, you would get an endpoint of 12.5 percent. So if you compare poverty rates in 1965 and 2007, the rate dropped by nearly five percentage points during that period, or by almost one-third.• Poverty among the elderly has plummeted. In 1967, about 30 percent of seniors were below the poverty line. That was down to 13.2 percent by 2008 -- a reduction by more than half.One of Johnsons greatest legislative achievements -- Medicare, the federal health care program for those 65 years and over -- helped lower elderly poverty, as did Social Security, a program that started under President Franklin D. Roosevelt but which Johnson enhanced with legislation in 1965 and 1967. A subsequent law enacted in 1973 began automatic, annual cost-of-living adjustments for Social Security beneficiaries. To the extent that Medicaid also helps poor older Americans, that has helped as well.All three of these programs, we should add, certainly qualify as entitlements that OReilly targets in his comment.• Certain subgroups have seen steep drops in poverty over the same period. Poverty among blacks was 55 percent in 1959 and 41 percent in 1966. By 2009, the rate had fallen to 25.9 percent. For black single moms without a father present, the poverty rate fell from 70.6 percent in 1959 and 65.3 in 1966 to 39.8 percent in 2009.Many Americans would say that 25.9 percent of blacks and 39.8 percent of black single mothers in poverty is still too high. Still the rates are still down dramatically over the period OReilly is referring to.Meanwhile, Hispanic poverty is up a few points since 1972 (the earliest year for which we have data) but poverty among Hispanic single moms with no father present has fallen from 53.5 percent in 1972 to 40.6 percent in 2009.• Alternate measurements of poverty show even steeper declines than the official statistics. A number of statisticians led by Douglas Besharov -- a University of Maryland scholar previously with the conservative American Enterprise Institute -- have come up with a more detailed measure of poverty that they say is more accurate than the official government statistic. Their alternative statistic includes factors ignored in the official statistics but which help poor Americans make it from day to day.Heres a rundown of the changes the Besharov group suggests, along with their impact on the poverty rate.Using a corrected inflation adjustment (to correct what they believe was an error in the 1970s): Lowers the poverty rate by 2 percentage points.Counting funds received from the Earned Income Tax Credit: Lowers the poverty rate by about 0.5 percentage points.Including the income of other people living in the same home: Lowers the poverty rate by 1 percentage point.Imputing income from the wealth in highly appreciated homes, a factor most important for poor elderly Americans: Lowers the poverty rate by 0.6 percentage pointsTreating food stamps, housing assistance, and free- or reduced-price school lunches as the equivalent of income: Lowers the poverty rate by about 1.3 percentage points. (This does, however, exclude the value of Medicaid, which Besharov estimated at roughly $3,225 per person.)Correcting for under-reporting of transfer payments: Lowers the poverty rate by about 0.8 percentage points.Correcting for the under-reporting of other types income: Lowers the poverty rate by about 1.6 percentage points.The grand total of these reductions is 7.8 percentage points, which would reduce the current poverty rate from 14.3 percent to 6.5 percent.We ran all of our critiques by a number of independent experts, including both liberals and conservatives, and they agreed that O'Reilly was incorrect. We also contacted The O'Reilly Factor, and a spokesman said the show plans to correct the record on its Monday, Aug. 1 show. This is not to say that OReilly is entirely wrong. Present levels of entitlements may not be sustainable, as he suggests. OReilly might be right that relatively few of the poor have been lifted into prosperity, as opposed to somewhere slightly above the poverty line. And the final 14 percent of Americans may be the most difficult to lift out of poverty, suggesting that at some point the cost-benefit ratio for anti-poverty expenditures may become harder to defend.The issue of whether were spending these social welfare dollars well, particularly on the margin, is an important one, and I think many people with very different political persuasions would agree we are not, said Eugene Steuerle, a fellow with the Urban Institute, a nonpartisan think tank.Still, the official statistics show that poverty has declined over the years -- indeed, quite steeply for certain groups -- and at least one unofficial estimate shows even lower rates today. The exact roles played in this decline by Medicare, Medicaid, the mid-1960s Social Security changes, food stamps and Head Start are uncertain, but its almost impossible to believe that they deserve no credit at all for the improved numbers. OReilly said the Great Society programs did nothing to reduce poverty, but we rule that claim False.",0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,False

Final Rating: False  ",ISIS leader Abu Bakr al Baghdadi was released by Obama in 2009.,"The march of the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, or ISIS, across a swath of Iraq has fractured a nation and spurred Republican attacks that the Obama administration is on the verge of snatching defeat from the jaws of victory. Fox News host Jeanine Pirro tied President Barack Obama to the roots of the current assault. On June 14, Pirro offered listeners this insight into the ISIS leader. (ISIS is also called ISIL, for Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant.) The head of this band of savages is a man named Abu Bakr al Baghdadi, the new Osama Bin Laden, Pirro said. A man released by Obama in 2009, who started ISIS a year later. And when Baghdadi left Camp Bucca, where the worst of the worst were held in Iraq, he threatened his American jailers saying, Ill see you in New York.  A reader wanted to know if Obama actually released Baghdadi, and we decided to look into it. Whatever the truth, the assertion has gained traction. For the presidents critics this fits with their disdain for the recent prisoner swap that freed Army Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl in exchange for five Taliban leaders who had been kept at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. Red State, a conservative blog, used the Baghdadi connection to talk about Obamas catch-and-release policy. We have two elements to verify. Was Baghdadi in U.S. custody in 2009 and did Obama have a direct connection to his release? Well deal with them in order. Will the real Abu Bakr al Baghdadi please stand up There have been several articles -- from Slate, and NBC among others -- that place Baghdadi at a detention facility in Iraq called Camp Bucca in 2009 (when Obama would have been president). However, all the talk tracks back to a Daily Beast interview with Army Col. Kenneth King, the former commander of Camp Bucca. That article said King knew Baghdadi at the camp and that he didnt expect to see him become the leader of a spectacularly vicious and brutal movement. Im not surprised that it was someone who spent time in Bucca but Im a little surprised it was him, King said. He was a bad dude, but he wasnt the worst of the worst. In this storyline, Baghdadi was handed over to Iraqi justice system late in 2009 shortly before Camp Bucca closed. However, when PunditFact asked the Defense Department to confirm the story, officials there said Baghdadi was released in 2004, not 2009. Ibrahim Awad Ibrahim Al Badry, also known as Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi was held as a civilian internee by U.S. Forces-Iraq from early February 2004 until early December 2004, when he was released, the Pentagon said in a statement. He was held at Camp Bucca. A Combined Review and Release Board recommended unconditional release of this detainee and he was released from U.S. custody shortly thereafter. We have no record of him being held at any other time. In short, according to the Defense Department, the man who heads ISIS was released in 2004, long before Obama took office, and was not recaptured. ABC News also has questioned Kings recollection, citing a a U.S. official that Baghdadi was not in American custody in 2009. I could be mistaken, King told ABC News, but Im 99 percent. Hes a dead ringer for the guy I had the run-in with  His face is very familiar. King declined to comment to PunditFact. A troubled detention policy If Baghdadi wasnt in American custody in 2009 as Defense Department officials say, then theres no way Obama could be to blame. But even if he was, the link between the ISIS leader and the American president are flimsy because the framework was set in in 2008 while George W. Bush was president. A little backstory. By July 2005, the United States had four detention facilities -- two near Baghdad, one in the northeastern corner of the country, and Camp Bucca in the far southeastern corner near the Kuwait border. The entire operation was known as Task Force 134. In the course of the war, some 80,000 people passed through these centers, according to the Defense Department. A Pentagon-commissioned study by RAND, a private policy analysis group, described a system that struggled with competing expectations. The incoming population was a mix of captured Sunni and Shiite militants, people rounded up in military raids and ordinary criminals. At times, a blend of overcrowding and sectarian animosities led to riots. The RAND study also said the 2007 surge -- the addition of 20,000 new troops into Iraq to quell spreading unrest -- pushed detainee levels to over 25,000 people. From 2007-08, Navy Captain Brian J. Bill served as the legal adviser to Detainee Operations for the Multi-National Force in Iraq. Bill described the process of vetting inmates in the U.S. Naval War College journal, International Law Studies. The military established nine review boards, working six days a week, to hear 20 cases each day. Bill reported that when the boards first began they released about 25 percent of the individuals who came before them. Later, that rose to 40 percent. The end of the detention policy At the end Bushs second term in 2008, American and Iraqi negotiators moved toward getting the United States out of the business of holding large numbers of Iraqis. Robert Chesney, professor of international security law at the University of Texas School of Law, said neither side wanted to see the network of detention centers continue. Its demise reflected a deliberate policy choice by the United States and Iraq to phase out that system and to rely instead on the Iraqi criminal justice system as the sole mechanism for detention going forward, Chesney wrote in 2011. That goal became part of the U.S.-Iraq Status of Forces Agreement, signed in November 2008. Under that agreement the United States agreed to turn over custody of such wanted detainees to Iraqi authorities pursuant to a valid Iraqi arrest warrant and shall release all the remaining detainees in a safe and orderly manner. The United Statescontinued to hold about 200 prisoners judged to pose the greatest risk. They were what remained from a group that numbered about 14,000 at the start of 2009. Aside from the so-called Deck of Cards detainees held at Camp Cropper (the top leaders in Saddam Husseins government), its hard to imagine how anyone in Washington would have any interest in who we held or released, Bill told PunditFact. By the end of 2009, its hard to imagine how we could have continued to hold anyone if the Iraqis themselves didnt decide to detain them. Our ruling Pirro said that Obama released the current head of ISIS from government custody in 2009. The Defense Department said that the man now known as Baghdadi was released in 2004. The evidence that Baghdadi was still in custody in 2009 appears to be the recollection of an Army colonel who said Baghdadis face is very familiar. Even if the colonel is right, Baghdadi was not set free; he was handed over to the Iraqis who released him some time later. But more important, the legal contract between the United States and Iraq that guaranteed that the United States would give up custody of virtually every detainee was signed during the Bush administration. It would have required an extraordinary effort to have held on to Baghdadi and there is no evidence that he was on anyones radar screen, assuming that he was in custody at all in 2009. The U.S.-Iraq agreement drove the release of thousands of detainees in 2009, but Obama had nothing to do with that.",0,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,False

Final Rating: False  ",Says H.R. 1 gives immigrants illegally in the country the right to vote.,"Some social media users are spreading a misleading claim about a Democratic proposal to expand voting rights. They claim that the bill, H.R. 1, gives immigrants illegally in the country the right to vote. For all of you who cant think for yourself on the left  you cry endlessly about foreign interference yet youre totally ok with allowing ILLEGALS the right to vote by backing H.R. 1, reads an Instagram post. The post was flagged as part of Facebooks efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The bills goal is to make it easier for eligible American citizens to register to vote. It doesnt change federal law that bars noncitizens from voting in federal elections. Nothing in the proposed statute would make it legal for noncitizens to register and/or vote, said Rebecca Green, professor and co-director of the Election Law Program at William & Mary Law School. There are federal and state criminal sanctions prohibiting noncitizens from registering and voting, which H.R. 1 does nothing to disturb. The Instagram post doesnt include any evidence for its assertions. But claims that the legislation would allow noncitizens to vote have often revolved around its provisions about automatic voter registration. Under the bill, people interacting with government offices — such as a motor-vehicle  or public-assistance agency — will have their information forwarded to election officials for registration purposes, unless they opt out. But nothing about this automatic registration allows noncitizens to vote or register to vote. The bill specifically says that only eligible citizens will be registered under this provision. If a persons citizenship status isnt on file at the government office, that person will have to fill out a registration form attesting to their citizenship. Noncitizens who falsify their citizenship status on one of these applications would be risking criminal sanction, Green said. Those who violate the law by voting or registering to vote can face incarceration, deportation or fines. Nearly 20 states and the District of Columbia have already either passed or implemented automatic voter registration, according to the Brennan Center for Justice. There is no evidence that these options have led to significant numbers of noncitizens becoming registered to vote, Danielle Lang, a voting expert at the Campaign Legal Center, previously told PolitiFact. Opponents of H.R. 1 have pointed to a glitch in Californias automatic voter registration program in 2018, which erroneously registered thousands of people to vote, including at least one noncitizen. Officials said that the error resulted from a programming flaw, and that they canceled the registrations and fixed the system. Any mail-in ballots sent to people who were mistakenly registered werent counted on Election Day. H.R. 1 also contains a provision stating that ineligible immigrants registered in error like the noncitizen in California cant be prosecuted for their immigration status. But anybody who lies during registration or intentionally misleads officials could still face prosecution. An Instagram post says that H.R. 1 would give immigrants illegally in the country the right to vote. The bill doesnt do that. H.R. 1 keeps in place federal and state criminal laws that prohibit noncitizens from voting or registering to vote. This claim is False.",0,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,False

Final Rating: False  ",I have consistently opposed shutdowns.,"With an end to the federal government shutdown in sight, Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, tried to argue that, contrary to popular belief, he was not the driving force behind the previous government shutdown in 2013. Back in 2013, Cruz -- then a junior member of the Senates minority party -- had tried to end funding for the Affordable Care Act. He pushed for language to defund Obamacare in spending bills, which would have forced then-President Barack Obama to choose between keeping the government open and crippling his signature legislative achievement. As the high-stakes legislative game played out, Obama and his fellow Democrats refused to agree to gut the law, and the Republicans, as a minority party, didnt have the numbers to force their will. Following a 16-day shutdown, lawmakers voted to fund both the government and the Affordable Care Act. Cruz was widely identified at the time as the leader ofthe defunding effort. Most famously, Cruz spoke about defunding Obamacare on the Senate floor during a 21-hour speech, punctuated by Green Eggs and Ham as a bedtime story for his children. Many in Cruzs own party, even those sympathetic with his goals, blamed him for a tactical blunder. During the spending impasse, his Republican colleagues launched a barrage of hostile questions at a GOP-only lunch, questioning whether Cruz had thought through the endgame. By the time Cruz was running for president in 2016, some Republicans were willing to criticize his approach publicly. Grover Norquist, an influential anti-tax activist, told the Washington Post in 2016 that Cruzs shutdown plan was like a plotline in TVs South Park in which a group of gnomes comes up with a nonsense plot to become rich. Josh Holmes, a former aide to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., told the Post that Cruzs approach was like a toddlers version of legislating. Leading up to the 2018 shutdown, Cruzs role in the 2013 budget impasse received fresh media coverage, since he was now in the Senate majority. Would he be able to reconcile his past tactics with his current urgings not to shut down the government? This came to a head during a Senate hallway exchange between Cruz and reporter Kasie Hunt that aired on MSNBC on Jan. 22, 2018: Cruz: We should not be shutting the government down. I have consistently opposed shutdowns. In 2013, I said we shouldn't shut the government down. Indeed, I went to the Senate floor repeatedly asking unanimous consent to reopen the government. Hunt: Sir, you stood in the way of that. Cruz: That's factually incorrect. It's a wonderful media narrative, but only one thing causes a shutdown: when you have senators vote to deny cloture on a funding bill. And when that bill comes up, you have a vote. A yes means fund the government, a no means don't fund the government. In 2013, virtually every single Republican voted to fund the government, including me multiple times. In fact, every single Democrat I believe in 2013 voted to shut the government down. The same thing is true here. Virtually every single Republican voted this week to fund the government. Virtually every single Democrat voted to shut it down. Hunt: Sir, that's simply not the case. This was about Obamacare funding Cruz: Those facts are incorrect. ... I get that you want to debate me, but you don't actually have any facts. Cruzs argument that he didnt cause a shutdown is one he and his camp has made in the past. In his 2015 book, A Time for Truth,Cruz wrote that neither he nor his ally, Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, nor the House Republicans even once voted to shut down the government. To the contrary, over and over again we voted to fund the government. And in the 2016 Post article, then-Cruz campaign spokesman Rick Tyler said the senator didnt pursue a government shutdown strategy. Thats not even sane. That would be a good thing to go out and campaign on? That wasnt what he did. He led the fight to defund Obamacare. This echoes the framing Cruz offered Hunt -- namely, that his motivation was not to keep the government from being funded, but rather to defund Obamacare, and that the only reason people believe this is because of the biased media. However, even if, for the sake of argument, you accept Cruzs line of thinking, his hallway comments offered a very specific definition of determining whether a lawmaker had consistently opposed shutdowns. Specifically, Cruz said that only one thing causes a shutdown: when you have senators vote to deny cloture on a funding bill. Cloture refers to a Senate vote to cut off debate and proceed to a bill; its a prerequisite for considering a bill, and these days, it typically takes 60 votes. So did Cruz ever vote to deny cloture on a funding bill? He did. It came on the legislation to end the 16-day shutdown -- a bill that didnt include the Obamacare defunding language that he had been seeking. If this spending bill didnt pass, the government wouldnt be funded and would have to remain closed. As it happened, the bill passed by a large bipartisan majority, but Cruz was one of 16 senators to vote against cloture. He was also one of 18 to vote against the bill itself. By doing the one thing that he himself said defines causing a shutdown, Cruz didn't consistently oppose shutdowns. When he knew everyone else would vote to end the shutdown, he voted against funding the government, said Josh Ryan, a political scientist at Utah State University and author of the forthcoming book The Lawmaking End Game: Bargaining and Resolution in Congress. Cruz campaign spokeswoman Catherine Frazier told PolitiFact that his goal was to defund Obamacare, not shut down the government, and that is the point he was making today. He voted several times and fought in the face of (Democratic)oppositionto fund vital government services -- including the military, veterans benefits, the National Guard, and National Health Institute --while working to defund Obamacare before it went into effect, at which point he knew it would be markedly more difficult to undo. Sen. Cruz voted against cloture on the final bill because it still funded Obamacare, and he was committed to continuing the debate to defund it, while supporting bills to fund the other functions of government not impacted by Obamacare. Cruz said, I have consistently opposed shutdowns. Debunking this assertion doesnt even require leveraging the many Republican statements criticizing Cruzs legislative tactics for prompting the 2013 government shutdown. It only requires using the standard Cruz laid out in the same interview -- that only one thing causes a shutdown: when you have senators vote to deny cloture on a funding bill. Cruz did that very thing in 2013, when he was one of 16 senators to vote against cloture for the spending bill that would go on to end the shutdown. He was also one of 18 senators to vote against the bill itself.",0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,False

The image contains a photo of a man and this quote, attributed to Dr. David Bellamy: Global warming is part of (a) natural cycle and theres nothing we can actually do to stop these cycles. The world is now facing spending a vast amount of money in tax to try to solve a problem that doesnt actually exist. The posts, including one by a Facebook page named Climate Change is Crap, were flagged as part of Facebooks efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The photo is of Bellamy, an English botanist who died in 2019. The scientist and onetime TV broadcaster uttered the quote in a 2008 interview, where he reiterated his opinion that warming is not man made. The current scientific consensus is that humans do cause climate change. It dates back at least to when PolitiFact began fact-checking such claims in 2007, when we found that the overwhelming consensus among climate scientists was that humans are the main cause of global warming. In a landmark report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change released Aug. 9, 234 authors relying on more than 14,000 studies said it is unequivocal that human influence has warmed the atmosphere, ocean and land. The report said that it has high confidence that the main driver of increased frequency and intensity of hot extremes experienced over most land regions since the 1950s is human-induced climate change. It is also likely, the report said, that human influence has resulted in a greater frequency of concurrent heatwaves and droughts on the global scale, fires in some regions and compound flooding in some places. NASA explains the consensus around human contributions to climate change this way: Multiple studies published in peer-reviewed scientific journals show that human activities are the primary cause of the observed climate-warming trend over the past century, and multiple studies show that 97% or more of actively publishing climate scientists agree: Climate-warming trends over the past century are extremely likely due to human activities. NASA explains that the Earths climate has changed throughout history and, over 800,000 years, most of those changes are due to small variations in the Earths orbit, which affects how much solar energy the planet receives. But todays trends are not a result of just variations to Earths orbit. NASA says theres a greater than 95% probability that most of the current warming trend is the result of human activity since the mid-20th century. Increased levels of so-called greenhouse gases, like carbon dioxide, cause the Earth to warm by blocking heat from escaping the atmosphere and radiating it back toward the Earths surface. Carbon dioxide can be released through, say, volcanic eruptions, but humans have also increased the concentration of atmospheric carbon dioxide by 47% since the Industrial Revolution started. Methane can likewise be produced through both natural sources and human activities, such as agriculture and livestock manure management. Human activities are changing the natural greenhouse, NASA says. Over the last century the burning of fossil fuels like coal and oil has increased the concentration of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2). This happens because the coal or oil burning process combines carbon with oxygen in the air to make CO2. To a lesser extent, the clearing of land for agriculture, industry and other human activities has increased concentrations of greenhouse gases. A viral image claims: Global warming is part of (a) natural cycle and theres nothing we can actually do to stop these cycles. The quote is from an English botanist from 2008. It does not reflect the current scientific consensus, which is that human activity does contribute to global warming.",0,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,False

Final Rating: False  ","Gas costs $7.89 at a station in Albuquerque, New Mexico.","An image of a sign advertising gas prices alongside a row of pumps on a clear, sunny day shows a startling figure: $7.89 a gallon for unleaded gas. Text over the image identifies the Maverik gas stations location as Albuquerque, N.M., on March 19. Awful, one of many people sharing the image on social media wrote before blaming President Joe Biden. Thanks Sleepy Jo. This post was flagged as part of Facebooks efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Gas prices have mostly been going up nationwide since they bottomed out at around $1.87 in late April 2020, as the economic recovery fuels more demand. The average retail price for all grades was $2.95 a gallon for the week ended March 22, according to federal data, up from about $2.47 when Biden took office. But $7.89 for regular grade would be way out of range. We searched online for Maverik gas Albuquerque and started to call each of the nine locations listed to get an explanation. Tiffany Garcia, a cashier at the first store, told us that she had already talked to a customer that day asking whether the gas was $7.89. Thats wrong, she said. The price of unleaded gas at the station was $2.78 a gallon March 19, and it was still that price when PolitiFact called on March 22. John Silva, a maintenance worker at the second store listed on Google Maps, told us the price of regular unleaded gas there was $2.77. He didnt know anything about prices surging to $7.89, he said. Our next call solved the mystery. Joanna Archuleta, a cashier at the third Maverikstore, knew exactly what we were talking about. The picture is real, she said, but the sign is at a Maverik store that hasnt opened yet. When it does open and customers are able to buy gas there, it will reflect the correct price. At her store, thats $2.78 a gallon for regular unleaded. This tracks with what we found on a website listing gas prices in Albuquerque shared on the website of the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy at the U.S. Energy Department. On March 22, regular unleaded gas in the city cost as little as $2.30 and as much as $2.89, according to Albuquerque Gas Prices. Diesel was a little more expensive: as much as $3.19. But we saw nothing close to the prices that appear in the image. The image is being used to claim that Biden has caused gas prices to surge to nearly $8 a gallon in New Mexico. That hasnt happened.",0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,False

Final Rating: Mostly False  ","When Trump won, we had the lowest voter turnout in 20 years.","Was voter turnout in the 2016 presidential election at a decades-long low? Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, who ran in the Democratic primaries before losing the nomination to Hillary Clinton, said so during an appearance on CNNs State of the Union on April 16, 2017. In an interview with CNNs Jake Tapper, Sanders said, You know, tomorrow afternoon, Tom Perez, who is the chair of the Democratic Party, and I will be taking a nine-state tour all across this country to do what I think is absolutely necessary. And that is to help revitalize American democracy. So many of our people are giving up on the political process. It is very frightening. In the last presidential election, when Trump won, we had the lowest voter turnout in 20 years. And in the previous two years before that, in the midterm election, we had the lowest voter turnout in 70 years. Hes right about the midterm election of 2014, but hes far off regarding turnout for the 2016presidential election. We turned to a widely trusted source for voter turnout statistics -- the United States Elections Project -- run by political scientist Michael McDonald of the University of Florida. There are different ways to measure voter turnout, but McDonald tends to favor the percentage of eligible voters who cast a ballot for the highest office contested that year. In presidential election years, that would mean the president. McDonald has compiled data on voter turnout going back to the 1700s. Heres the rundown: According to this chart, voter turnout percentages have settled into a range between the low 50s and the low 60s since the early decades of the 20th century -- well below what it was during most of the 1800s, but above what it was in the countrys first few decades of existence. But on Sanders specific point, the final turnout figure for 2016 -- 59.3 percent -- amounted to a middling result for the past 20-year period, which is the time frame he used. It was lower than the 2004 and 2008 turnout figures, but it exceeded the turnout rate for 1996, 2000, and 2012. Looking back even further, the 2016 turnout rate is actually even more impressive. Youd have to go back to 1968 to find a year other than 2004 and 2008 in which voter turnout was higher than it was in 2016. And 1968 was the last election before a constitutional amendment took effect guaranteeing that all 18-year-olds could vote. So, starting in 1972, millions of teenagers were added to the denominator in the voter turnout calculation, a change that tended to depress the percentage somewhat in the elections that followed. Using the turnout among the voting-eligible population tends to be a more useful measurement than the percentage of the voting-age population that cast a ballot, because the latter statistic counts ineligible voters in the denominator, including noncitizens and felons whose voting rights have not been restored. Because noncitizens and felons dont have a choice about whether to vote or not, turnout statistics that include them arent as enlightening as those about just the voters who have a choice about whether to vote. Still, even if you use voting-age population instead of voting-eligible population, Sanders isnt correct. In 2016, the turnout rate using that measurement was 54.7 percent. While that trailed the rates for 2004 and 2008, it exceeded the rates for 2000 and 2012. Our friends at FactCheck.org noted that Sanders may have been thinking about preliminary -- but inaccurate -- news reports shortly after the election that indicated that voter turnout in 2016 would hit a two-decade low. The counting of late-arriving ballots, such as those from the growing number of states that rely heavily on mailed-in ballots, rendered such assertions moot. Sanders office did not respond to an inquiry. For the record, Sanders' statistic for the 2014 midterm elections was accurate. Turnout among eligible voters was about 36 percent in 2014 -- the lowest since the 33.9 percent in 1942, when the nation was fighting World War II. Here is McDonalds full data set for midterm elections. Our ruling Sanders said that when Trump won, we had the lowest voter turnout in 20 years. Thats not correct. In 2016, turnout was lower than it was for two of the elections in that span (2004 and 2008) but it was higher than it was for three others (1996, 2000 and 2012).",0.2,0.5,1.0,0.5,0.0,0.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,Mostly False

Final Rating: Mostly False  ","Says in the last 20 years, the French have not stood by the United States on foreign policy.","At a presidential campaign event in Georgetown, Ohio, on Feb. 17, 2012, Rick Santorum took a shot at France.President Barack Obama, Santorum said, actually went to France a year or so ago and was with Nicolas Sarkozy and said that, 'Here I am with the French Prime Minister, our best ally in the world.' Now think about this. Name one time in the last 20 years that the French stood by us with anything. But in Barack Obama's eyes, that makes them our best ally, because they fought what was in the best interest of our country.Well overlook the fact that Santorum misstated Sarkozys title -- hes Frances president. What we were wondering about is whether Santorum is right that its impossible to name one time in the last 20 years that the French stood by us with anything. Well focus on his underlying point, that France has consistently gone its own way on foreign policy rather than standing by the United States.We emailed the Santorum campaign asking for support for the candidate's statement, but we received no response.Its true that France pushed for a more multilateral approach to confronting Saddam Hussein's Iraq than the George W. Bush adminstration wanted. The run-up to the Iraq war in 2002 and 2003 represented a major break in the normally amicable U.S.-French relationship, epitomized by the House of Representatives decision to change the name of french fries to freedom fries in its cafeteria.But experts on United States and European diplomacy say its wrong to extrapolate from that one case. Overall, they agreed, Santorums claim is way off base.Its inaccurate and terribly misleading, said Richard Kuisel, an adjunct professor at Georgetown Universitys BMW Center for German and European Studies and author of The French Way: How France Embraced and Rejected American Values and Power (2011) and Seducing the French: The Dilemma of Americanization (1993).Santorums clock stopped in 2003, added Justin Vaïsse, senior fellow and director of research at the Center on the U.S. and Europe at the Brookings Institution.The role of SarkozyA major reason for the improvement in the U.S.-French relationship has been the shift from former president Jacques Chirac to Sarkozy in 2007.French-American military and diplomatic relations have been excellent under Sarkozy, who is an open admirer of American culture and society, said Jean-Philippe Mathy, a professor of French at the University of Illinois and author of French Resistance: The French-American Culture Wars (2000).When Sarkozy came to Washington to address a joint session of Congress in 2007, he found himself met by a standing ovation and occasional whoops, the New York Times reported. He at first appeared to revel in it, but as it extended to two minutes and longer, he began to appear almost embarrassed.We may have differences, we may disagree on things, we may even have arguments, as in any family, Sarkozy said. But in times of difficulty, in times of hardship, one stands true to ones friends, one stands shoulder to shoulder with them, and one helps them.Sarkozys reception was a far cry from Chiracs, when only about 100 members of Congress attended and young pages were recruited to fill empty seats, the Times reported.AfghanistanThe most prominent example of U.S.-French cooperation has been Frances contribution to the NATO forces in Afghanistan -- an operation instigated and heavily supported by the U.S. As of mid-January, France had 3,832 troops deployed, the fifth-largest number of any country after the U.S., the United Kingdom, Germany and Italy. About 600 French troops have been training the Afghan National Army and Afghan National Police Force, according to the Congressional Research Service. Since the start of operations, France has lost 82 servicemembers in Afghanistan.None other than George W. Bush praised Frances commitment to the Afghanistan operation in a speech on the six-month anniversary of the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. The power and vitality of our coalition have been proven in Afghanistan, Bush said. More than half of the forces now assisting the heroic Afghan fighters, or providing security in Kabul, are from countries other than the United States. There are many examples of commitment: our good ally, France, has deployed nearly one-fourth of its navy to support Operation Enduring Freedom.Côte dIvoire, Libya and NATOAfghanistan is not the full extent of Frances military engagement alongside the United States. As of February 2011, France had nearly 9,000 troops in a variety of military operations across the globe, CRS wrote. In addition to Afghanistan, which is a NATO operation, France had almost 1,500 military personnel under U.N. auspices in Lebanon and at least 1,000 soldiers in Côte dIvoire.France and the U.S. have been constantly on the same line regarding Côte dIvoire since 2002, even when the two countries were at odds over Iraq, Vaïsse said. Last year, with the approval of Washington, France provided the troops and helicopters for the U.N. mission to oust Laurent Gbagbo and install Alassane Ouattara, the democratically elected president.France also cooperated with the U.S. in Libya -- in fact, France, along with the U.K., pushed the U.S. to action there in the first place.More quietly, but significantly, Sarkozy in 2009 ended a self-imposed exile from NATOs integrated command structure, an absence that dated back more than 40 years to French president Charles de Gaulle.France is currently the fourth largest contributor of troops to alliance operations and a significant financial contributor to NATO, CRS wrote. However, it had only very limited participation in the alliances military decision-making structures after then-President de Gaulle withdrew the country from NATOs integrated command structure in 1966. Despite domestic opposition from critics who fear that the move could limit French military independence, the French parliament approved Sarkozys decision by a vote of 329-238 on March 17, 2009. U.S. officials have welcomed French reintegration as an important step toward improving alliance cohesion and strengthening the European role within NATO.During the past 20 years or so, France has also fought in cooperation with the United States in the Persian Gulf War in the early 1990s and in Bosnia and Kosovo in the mid-1990s.Anti-terrorism and Iran sanctionsFrance has been a strong partner with the U.S. on anti-terrorism intelligence and coordination, especially under Sarkozy, a former Interior Minister. France has been the best ally in the war on terrorism, having had a head start on al-Qaida networks because of bombings in Paris in the 1990s that were linked with the Algerian civil war, Vaïsse said.Finally, France has sought stringent sanctions against Iran for its pursuit of nuclear technology.France has played a central role in pushing for three rounds of U.N. sanctions related to Irans nuclear program, CRS wrote, including a key role in passing the latest and most stringent U.N. sanctions against Iran to date. Those sanctions, imposed in 2010, included a ban on new investment in Iranian oil and gas industries, a ban on insurance and re-insurance of Iranian government institutions and their affiliates; and extensive asset freezes of Iranian companies and individuals.In fact, France has sometimes sought more stringent sanctions against Iran than some of its allies. On Iran sanctions, the French are actually on a tougher line than the Obama administration -- a hard line that would be closer to Republican candidates like Santorum and Romney, and Congress in general, Vaïsse said.Our rulingSantorums mockery of Frances willingness to advance U.S. foreign policy goals is misplaced. Its true that the two allies broke over Iraq policy, but thats the exception rather than the rule. On a wide range of issues over two decades -- from the Persian Gulf War to the Balkans to Afghanistan to counter-terrorism to Iran sanctions -- France has worked diplomatically with the U.S. and has repeatedly put its troops in harms way.",0,0.8,1,0,0,0.5,0.8,0,0.5,Mostly False

Final Rating: False","Says a powder has been developed that, when mixed with water, is being used in Germany as a mist. Health care workers go through a misting tent going into the hospital and it kills the coronavirus completely dead not only right then, but any time in the next 14 days that the virus touches anything thats been sprayed, it is killed.","During a live interview on a local television station in East Texas, U.S. Rep. Louie Gohmert discussed the coronavirus and measures he says some health care workers around the world are taking to stay safe while treating patients who have tested positive for the virus. Gohmert, a Republican from Tyler, said he recently spoke with an Arizona-based company that is producing a powder that, when mixed with water, can kill the coronavirus on contact. He said the same product, or one like it, is already in use in Germany, and he is trying to get the Arizona-based product fast-tracked in the United States. It is being used in Germany as a mist, he said. Health care workers go through a misting tent going into the hospital and it kills the coronavirus completely dead not only right then, but any time in the next 14 days that the virus touches anything thats been sprayed it is killed. The problem with Gohmerts statement? No such product exists and nothing similar is in use in Germany. What your congressman said is absolute nonsense, said Dr. Jörn Wegner, a spokesman for Deutsche Krankenhausgesellschaft, or the German Hospital Association. There are no such tents and theres no powder or magical cure. Gohmerts office did not return a request for more information about his statement, including what substance constitutes this powder and the name of the company in Arizona that he says is working on such a product. It is possible Gohmert was thinking of recent news reports of sterilization stations in use in China — images show individuals being sprayed with mist as they walk through a tunnel — but experts said the bleach-type sprays being used at these stations are likely not effective against the coronavirus. Protective measures in Germany A search of top news publications in Germany and the United States revealed no recent articles published about a powder or disinfectant being used on hospital employees that kills the virus on contact and for 14 days after the fact. While Germany has been hit hard by the coronavirus, it is also among the countries with the lowest fatality rate. News outlets have explored why Germany has reported such a low fatality rate, including analyzing how its hospitals are handling the outbreak. But those reports have not mentioned a substance like the one Gohmert described. In Germany, health authorities at the state level are responsible for hospital planning and operation while the Federal Ministry of Health drafts overarching policies and regulations. Sebastian Gülde, spokesman for the Bundesministerium für Gesundheit, or Federal Ministry of Health, said he is aware of some hospitals that are using tents for screening for symptoms of the virus, but he did not have knowledge of a product like the one Gohmert described. I did not hear of a disinfecting agent that keeps pathogens away for two weeks, Gülde said. Gülde directed PolitiFacts inquiry to the Deutsche Gesellschaft für Krankenhaushygiene, the German Society of Hospital Hygiene, which issues recommendations on best practices for hospital hygiene and health. Thomas Ruttkowski, the organizations spokesman, said there is no product like the one Gohmert described. Im sorry, but we did not heard about that magic powder, he said in an email. Thank you for your mail.  Finally, something to laugh about. Protecting against the virus During the interview, Gohmert mentioned that a company in Arizona was developing a similar product, but his team did not return a request for more information about the company or its product. A thorough web search did not return results for news stories or company websites for a business that may be working on producing this kind of powder-like product that can kill the coronavirus on contact. Currently, no disinfectant of this nature has been highlighted by the Environmental Protective Agency as being effective for use against SARS-CoV-2 (the coronavirus that causes COVID-19). None of these products registered with the EPA are approved for use on people. They are strictly surface disinfectants. Amy Cross, project coordinator at the National Pesticide Information Center, said she is not aware of a product on the list of EPA-regulated surface disinfectants that meets the description Gohmert offered. There are some products that are powder-based and can be combined with water and used in a liquid form, Cross said. But like all of the disinfectants on the list, the product is a liquid and has a set contact time — the amount of time a surface needs to stay wet with a product for it to be effective. Cross said this time varies by product, ranging from 15 seconds to 15 minutes. The idea that it would have residual activity after the surface is no longer wet to kill that virus is incredibly surprising to me, because I havent found any other products that have those similar claims, she said of the powder Gohmert described. When reached for comment, a World Health Organization spokesperson pointed to the groups guidelines for infection prevention and control geared towards health care workers treating individuals who are likely infected with the coronavirus. The guidelines do not make mention of a disinfectant like the one Gohmert mentioned. They emphasize the need for workers to use personal protective equipment when necessary and practice rigorous hand hygiene. The WHO guidelines also emphasize the importance of environmental cleaning and disinfection procedures and state that washing surfaces with water and detergent and applying commonly used hospital-level disinfectants (such as sodium hypochlorite) are effective and sufficient procedures. Wegner of the German Hospital Association echoed these recommendations. The only protection against the virus are personal protection equipment – masks, disposable coats and gloves – and proper hygiene, he said. Our ruling Gohmert said that there is a powder substance that, when mixed with water, is being used as a disinfecting mist in Germany. Health care workers go through a misting tent going into the hospital and it kills the coronavirus completely dead not only right then, but any time in the next 14 days that the virus touches anything thats been sprayed it is killed, he said. But no such product seems to exist and no similar product is in use in Germany. There are no products currently in use as disinfecting agents in the United States that come close to meeting the description Gohmert offered. Gohmert did not return a request seeking more information about his statement.",0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,False

Final Rating: False  ",Ted Cruz is in negotiations to be Donald Trumps running mate.,"We spotted this headline below a post on the Dallas Morning News Trailblazers political news blog: Breaking: Cruz Negotiating With Trump for VP Spot. Of course, that would be Texas Sen. Ted Cruz negotiating with Republican presidential frontrunner Donald Trump to serve as Trumps November 2016 running mate. Huge! But wait--wheres the breathless CNN report, the insiders analysis on Fox News or even the basic newspaper scoop? We found nothing of the sort in online searches or in the Nexis news database and when we asked Cruzs campaign about the Feb. 25, 2016, Elect Leaders post, spokesman Brian Phillips replied by email: Is this a serious request? Well, the Cruz-negotiating-with-Trump item, also posted on ElectLeaders.com, which describes itself as keeping watch on our leaders and wannabe leaders, has a little traction. When we saw the headline March 21, 2016, the post had been shared on Facebook more than 34,000 times. Historical precedent And history shows a joint ticket could play out. In 2008, Barack Obama chose to run with a failed presidential hopeful, Joe Biden. In 1980, Ronald Reagan reached out to the defeated George H.W. Bush. Twenty years before, Democrat John F. Kennedy picked Texan Lyndon B. Johnson. So Trump-Cruz, pairing the frontrunner with the fellow running second, is possible. On the other hand, Phillips followed up with an email calling the post categorically false. Anonymous sourcing For our part, we noticed a red flag in that the Elect Leaders item doesnt quote named sources, not even a campaign spokeswomanoffering a no comment. Heres what the post says: A high ranking Cruz campaign official has told Elect Leaders that Sen. Cruz is in negotiations with Mr. Trump to become his Vice Presidential Nominee after Rubio dropped out Tuesday. Thats confusing timewise in that Sen. Marco Rubio dropped his presidential bid Tuesday March 15, 2016, after falling short of victory in his home state of Florida. The item goes on to say Cruz has been the most consistent performer in primaries behind Trump. They are seeing the writing on the wall and want to negotiate from a point of strength which will evaporate over time. The official, again unnamed, stated Mr. Trump is interested in using Sen. Cruzs ground game in the general election, likes his appeal to the conservative base and his stance on immigration. Of the other options for VP none hold as strong of an opinion on immigration outside of Gov. Jan Brewer from Arizona who is also being considered.Brewer, by the way, is no longer governor. Finally, the post says, Cruz, the former solicitor general of Texas, has an eye on shifting from vice president to the Supreme Court. Cruz, the item says, in exchange for his support is wanting to be named to the Supreme Court if an opening occurs while Mr. Trump is president. Mr. Trump does not see this as an issue and a small price to pay to bring Sen. Cruz his fundraisers, donors and staff on board, the post says. We tried to reach out to Elect Leaders about the post and didnt hear back. Otherwise, we found no indication Trump-Cruz negotiations were (or are) afoot. A Trump maybe, Cruz'szero interest In November 2015 -- eons ago in politicking time maybe especially given Trumps references to Cruz as LyinTed-- Trump told conservative talk-show host Laura Ingraham that Cruz might be his choice for the No. 2 slot. To be fair, Trumpdeclined to name a potential running matefrom among his GOP opponents before noting his affection for Cruz. Well, I like like him, Trump said at the time. Hes backed everything Ive said  Ted Cruz is now agreeing with me 100 percent. But Trump also didnt go further down the veep path, saying: I like to think of victory, Ive had a lot of victories, and I like to do victories first, then start thinking about other things. Cruz, meantime, said March 15, 2016 that he wasnt inclined to join Trump on a single ticket, if offered the vice presidency. Conservative talk-show host Hugh Hewittasked if Cruz would ever agree to serve as Trumps vice president? I have absolutely zero interest in doing that, Cruz replied, going on to say he expected to overtake Trump and win the delegates needed to secure the presidential nomination. And on March 21, 2016, just before we completed this fact check, Cruz told CNNs Wolf Blitzer: I have zero interest whatsoever in being Trumps running mate. Blitzer had asked Cruz about the possibility by noting Trump earlier responded to Blitzers question about choosing Cruz as his running mate by saying: Crazier things happen in politics. Our ruling On Facebook, Elect Leaders said Cruz and Trump are negotiating a Trump-Cruz Republican ticket. Anything is possible. But we don't see evidence the two camps are latelyplotting a shared ticket. FALSE – The statement is not accurate.

Final Rating: False  ",Our children do not spend any time in school learning about our own U.S. Constitution.,"In a recent column criticizing the Mansfield school districts plans to introduce an Arabic program to its schools, state Rep. Dan Flynn, R-Canton, wondered why Arabic culture is a priority at a time when our children do not spend any time in school learning our own U.S. Constitution.We wondered whether Texas students spend no time studying the Constitution, as Flynn says in the opinion piece published Feb. 14 on the North Texas Navigator news website.When we contacted the representatives office, Flynns chief of staff, David Erinakes told us there is no dedicated class on the U.S. Constitution as early as first grade, and (Flynns) implication is that he believes all Texas school children should have a class on the U.S. Constitution while theyre in school at least one time.Erinakes said that while the Constitution is written into the states curriculum standards for the public schools, there isnt very much time spent on it. Erinakes said Flynn based this conclusion on conversations with teachers who have recently visited the representatives office.We turned next to the Texas Essential Knowledge and Skills for social studies, curriculum standards outlining what students must be taught in Texas classrooms. In an online post of the standards now in place — an update takes effect in 2011-12 — we spotted about 35 references to teaching students about the constitution.According to the standards, students are introduced to the U.S. Constitution in fifth grade when they must identify the important ideas in the Declaration of Independence and the U.S. Constitution and examine fundamental rights guaranteed in the Bill of Rights. Seventh graders should be able to explain the influence of the U.S. Constitution on the Texas Constitution. Eighth graders are supposed to study the creation and ratification of the U.S. Constitution.History and government comes under the heading of social studies until high school, when specific courses in those subjects are offered. In a course in U.S. history since the Reconstruction, students are expected to identify and analyze methods on expanding the right to participate in the Democratic process, including... amendments to the U.S. Constitution. A significant focus of the states mandatory high school U.S. government class is on the U.S. Constitution, its underlying principles and ideas and the form of government it created.Next we looked at online versions of the Texas Assessment of Knowledge and Skills tests annually administered to students from grades 3 to 11. Fifth- and eighth-graders must pass the reading and math tests, and 11th-grade students must pass all portions of test, which include social studies, to graduate.Searching for constitution in the social-studies portion of the 2009 test for eighth-graders, we found four references, including one question asking students to identify how the 13th Amendment changed the Constitution (B. Abolished slavery).We found five references to the Constitution in the tenth-grade test, including a question about what principle the Constitutions establishment of the executive, legislative and judicial branches reflects.And in 11th grade? Two references to the U.S. Constitution.Debbie Ratcliffe, an education agency spokeswoman, told us that local educators determine how much time is spent on the Constitution, but she pointed out that each grade is required to observe Celebrate Freedom Week, which falls on the week of Constitution Day — Sept. 17. The standards going into effect in 2011-12 reflect the observance. According to the pending standards, third through eighth grade classes, for example, must include appropriate instruction concerning the intent, meaning and importance of the Declaration of Independence and the U.S. Constitution during Celebrate Freedom Week, or during another full school week as determined by each school districts board of trustees.Andy Welch, a spokesman for the Austin school district, told us that Austin teachers teach what the state standards require.Richie Escovedo, a Mansfield district spokesman, told us: We definitely do teach the Constitution. He pointed us to the districts curriculum specifying that students study the Constitution in fifth, seventh and 12th grade. Also, Escovedo noted, district third-graders study questions such as, Why was a new Constitution needed after the American Revolution? and How does the Bill of Rights protect you, even as a child?When we told Flynn that we couldnt find evidence to support his claim, Erinakes responded: You are correct that it is in the standards, but as to the time spent it seems to be minimal at best... Relative to the amount of time spent on other subjects, our children do not spend any time at all learning about the U.S. Constitution.Flynns statement, though, was absolute. Lacking back-up information from his end or any other evidence that either schools are flouting the states curriculum standards or students arent being held to them, the statement more than fails.

Vance said, People who voted for Trump voted for him for racist reasons.","Of the five Ohio Republicans hoping to be their partys nominee for U.S. Senator, four openly angled for the endorsement of former President Donald Trump. Trump picked Hillbilly Elegy author and venture capitalist J.D. Vance. Less than a week before the May 3 primary, Club for Growth Action, a super PAC backing one of Vances competitors Josh Mandel, ran an ad that said Trump got it wrong with Vance. Heres the transcript: Vance on video: The elites were right about Donald Trump, right. I'm a never Trump guy. Male actor: Has Trump seen this? Newscast clip: President Trump tweeting a surprise endorsement of Mitt Romney for his run for  Female actor 1: How'd that turn out? Male actor: Look, I love Trump, but he's getting it wrong with J.D. Vance, too. Vance on video: I might have to vote for Hillary Clinton. Vance on video: People who voted for Trump voted for him for racist reasons. Male actor: Where does he get off saying that? Female actor 2: We've got our own eyes in our own ears. Female actor 1: J.D. Vance is a fraud. The clip that caught our ear was of Vance saying, People who voted for Trump voted for him for racist reasons. Theres an obvious video edit in that section, and we wanted to see what the ad left out. Turns out, it was a deceptive edit that changed the meaning of Vances words. The video comes from an on-stage discussion with Vance in 2017 at the University of Chicagos Institute of Politics. The theme was America in the Trump era, and its worthwhile to see both how the interviewer teed up his question, and how Vance answered it. Where do you think race played into all this? the interviewer asked. Because I think the sort of myth is that all these Trump supporters are vehement racists and anti-immigrant. And so where do you think it played in? Race definitely played a role in the 2016 election, Vance said. I think that race will always play a role in our country. It's just sort of a constant fact of American life. And definitely some people who voted for Trump were racists, and they voted for him for racist reasons. I always resist the idea that the real thing driving most Trump voters was racial anxiety or racial animus, partially because I didn't see it. Vance goes on to say that the primary reason most people voted for Trump was his focus on jobs. That was the core thesis of Trump's entire argument, Vance said. And so it strikes me as a little bizarre to chalk it up to sort of racial animus. Because, one, the country is less racist now than it was 15 years ago. And we weren't electing Donald Trump 15 years ago. And two, that wasn't the core part of his message, and that wasn't what a lot of his voters were really connecting with. The Club for Growth attack ad made small but telling edits in Vances words. Someone watching the ad heard, People who voted for Trump voted for him for racist reasons. The full version was, Definitely some people who voted for Trump were racists, and they voted for him for racist reasons. I always resist the idea that the real thing driving most Trump voters was racial anxiety or racial animus. First, the ad cut his first word, some. That made it sound like Vance was talking about all Trump voters. The next edit is subtle. It deletes were racists, and they. This makes the statement more blunt. But the most misleading edit was dropping Vances very next sentence: I always resist the idea that the real thing driving most Trump voters was racial anxiety or racial animus. Club for Growth vice president for communication Joe Kildea rejected the idea that the edits changed Vances meaning. A Club for Growth Action ad said Vance had said, People who voted for Trump voted for him for racist reasons. In the full interview from which those words were drawn, Vance allowed that some people voted for Trump for racist reasons, but he said most people voted for Trump for his policies on jobs. Vance rejected the idea that racism played much of a role in Trumps win.

Final Rating: False  ",Says Democrats are on vacation until May 4 and refuse to come back to sign a bill to help small businesses.,"President Donald Trump recently said that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi needs to come back from vacation, blaming her for a stalemate over a deal to add funds to the exhausted small business loan program, which ran out of money on April 16. Posts on Facebook take the vacation claim further, and suggest that all Democrats are on vacation until May 4 and refuse to come back to sign a bill to replenish the program. This is misleading. All of Congress, which includes House and Senate Republicans, are in recess to avoid spreading the coronavirus. The post was flagged as part of Facebooks efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Congress announced it would extend its recess until May 4 to continue practicing social distancing and avoid transmitting the coronavirus. As the country continues working together to flatten the curve, following the advice of health experts, the full Senate is not expected to travel back to Washington D.C. sooner than Monday, May 4th, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said in a statement on April 14. All members will receive at least 24 hours notice if this changes. This bipartisan decision reflects consultation with Leader Schumer and my colleagues in Senate leadership. House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer made a similar announcement April 13, saying that absent an emergency, the House is not expected to meet prior to Monday, May 4, 2020. Senate leaders announced on April 21 that the two parties reached a deal for another relief package. The legislation could be approved by unanimous consent, which does not require a majority of members to be present. But Democrats have not refused to come back from vacation. Both the Senate and the House are in recess until May 4 to avoid spreading the coronavirus. The decision was made by congressional leadership. This post rates False.",0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,False

Final Rating: Half True  ","In Buffalo's SolarCity project, Andrew Cuomo will create maybe 500 jobs if it ever happens at all, at about $1.5 million per job.","Buffalo developer Carl Paladino, whos no fan of New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, has worked to boost Donald Trumps electoral chances in New York State. Now, hes showering praise on Trumps pick for vice president, Indiana Gov. Mike Pence, and hes using Cuomo as his foil. Speaking to The Buffalo News at the Republican National Convention, Paladino praised Pences jobs record. I've been reading up on Pence. Pence created 2,000 jobs with an investment that cost about $5,000 per job. Andrew Cuomo will create maybe 500 jobs if it ever happens at all, at about $1.5 million per job, Paladino said, referring to Buffalos SolarCity project. It's so obviously incompetent, if not corrupt. Cuomos investment in the SolarCity project, seen by many as a boost for Buffalo, has been criticized by others. Is Paladino right about Cuomos effort in Buffalo? Indianas 2,000 new jobs Paladino did not reply to our request on what formed the basis for his claim. Abby Gras of the Indiana Economic Development Corp. - a state entity similar to Empire State Development - pointed to one possibility.Subaru of Indiana Automotive announced last year it would create 1,204 jobs in Lafayette, Indiana. The state offered the company up to $7.9 million in performance-based tax credits, which comes out to roughly $6,500 per job. While not the numbers Paladino cited, he came close. The economic development agency has said the average investment in performance based tax credit for jobs created statewide in 2016 was about $9,400 per job. Cost of SolarCity jobs When the RiverBend facility was announced, the state said it would invest $750 million to build the facility and buy equipment that SolarCity needs to open. The state does not give money directly to the company. The state invested the money on the condition the company creates more than 1,400 jobs in the Buffalo area. Initially the jobs were expected to be in manufacturing. Earlier this year, the company said it will still create the same number of jobs - but not all in manufacturing. As The News previously reported, more automation at the facility will mean fewer manufacturing workers will be needed. SolarCity said it is still committed to a minimum of 500 manufacturing positions at RiverBend, while other positions will be shifted to sales, project development and other functions. If you count only the 500 manufacturing jobs, Paladino's statement would be correct. Spending $750 million on a facility for 500 manufacturing jobs comes out to $1.5 million per job. But the companys agreement with the state calls for creating 1,460jobs in the Buffalo area.The company also agreed to invest $5 billion in New York State and create 5,000 jobs statewide. If the company doesnt fulfill its end of the bargain, it has to pay the state $41 million in penalties per year. Based on those numbers the cost per job for the company's commitment statewide is $160,000 per job, but the state says thats not a fair way to look at it. The problem with using grade school math to analyze an economic development project of this magnitude is that it doesnt take into account the multi-billion dollar investment from SolarCity, and impact of the thousands of direct and indirect jobs that will be created statewide, said Jason Conwall from Empire State Development. When we evaluate supporting a project, we base our decision on all of its merits. So, while thousands of new jobs are part of the project, our investment is based on the project in its entirety, including the investment, new jobs and overall economic impact in both Western NY and New York State. The state also owns the building and the equipment it bought, which the state can use to attract another company should SolarCity leave. In the meantime, the state says the project has created about 1,500 temporary construction jobs. This is not the first time the state has undertaken a project like this. Since 1997 the state has spent about $947 million over two decades building the NanoTech Complex in Albany. The building houses both the College of Nanoscale Science and Engineering and 4,000 employees from more than 300 corporate partners. The original building was a $16.5 million investment that was built and equipped to attract companies interested in investing in nanotechnology. Since then, more than $20 billion has been invested by companies into work being done at the facility. The project has largely been a success, attracting corporate partners like IBM and Samsung. The same idea is now being replicated in a handful of cities upstate like Rochester where a photonics manufacturing facility is planned. Comparing both Experts say comparing the SolarCity project to Indianas tax incentive program is like apples to oranges. Indiana offers a simple tax break. New York State is building and equipping a factory. The value of New Yorks approach – and thus the cost per job created – depends on what would happen if SolarCity fails. If New York State could find a new tenant or even sell the factory and equipment, the states investment per job is much lower than if the factory and equipment has no value if SolarCity leaves. Ron Deutsch from the Fiscal Policy Institute agreed the two situations were largely incomparable. Our ruling Carl Paladino referred toBuffalos SolarCity project when he said at the Republican National Convention that Cuomo will create maybe 500 jobs if it ever happens at all, at about $1.5 million per job.Paladino understated the number of jobs being created by SolarCity, which overstated the cost. The agreement between SolarCity and the state called for 1,460 total jobs to be created in Buffalo.",0.5,0.5,1.0,0.5,0.3,0.5,0.4,1.0,0.5,Half True
