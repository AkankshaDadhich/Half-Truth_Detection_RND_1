10844,false,Frank Keating,"In the United States, 50 percent of social services are provided by the Catholic church.","Former Oklahoma Gov. Frank Keating, a Republican, appeared on NBCs Meet the Press just days after the selection of Cardinal Jorge Mario Bergoglio of Argentina to be the new pope. In praising Pope Francis life of humility, Keating said that judging by his selection, the church was poised to focus on caring for the poor and vulnerable. In his remarks, Keating offered a statistic to demonstrate the depth of the churchs commitment to charity. In the United States, 50 percent of social services are provided by the Catholic church, said Keating, who now serves as president and CEO of the American Bankers Association. Keating did not return an inquiry for this story, nor did Catholic Charities USA, the largest charitable organization run by the Catholic church. We asked a variety of experts on philanthropy whether they had heard this statistic or knew where it came from, but none did. We should start by noting that Catholic charity work is extensive and widely considered a crucial part of the nations social safety net. By itself, Catholic Charities USA, has more than 2,500 local agencies that serve 10 million people annually, said Mary L. Gautier, a senior research associate at the Center for Applied Research in the Apostolate, an institute at Georgetown University that studies the church. And Catholic Charities is supplemented by a panoply of other Catholic-affiliated groups, Gautier said, including St. Vincent De Paul societies, social justice committees, soup kitchens, food pantries, and other similar programs organized independently by thousands of Catholic parishes each year. For a variety of reasons, its difficult to quantify exactly how big Catholic-backed charity is, but we tried our best to sift the data with the help of the National Center for Charitable Statistics, a project of the Urban Institute, a nonpartisan think tank in Washington. The first question we asked is whether the sum of all Catholic-sponsored charity amounts to half of all charitable activity by private groups in the United States. We started with the biggest, Catholic Charities USA, then worked outward. In 2010, Catholic Charities USA reported expenditures of between $4.2 billion and $4.4 billion, according to the Chronicle of Philanthropy, which publishes an annual list of the 400 biggest charities in the United States, ranked by the amount of donations they receive. This enabled it to rank near the top of the 400 list, behind two major social-services charities -- the United Way and the Salvation Army, neither of which is affiliated with the Catholic church. Meanwhile, Catholic News Service has noted a few other Catholic organizations that made the Chronicles annual 400 list, including Father Flanagan Boys Home and Covenant House. This excludes Catholic universities, which mainly provide higher education; hospitals, which are categorized separately from social services; and groups that focus on overseas work. Lets assume that other Catholic groups that didnt crack the top 400 list spent six times what Catholic Charities USA spent, a multiplier that experts we contacted thought was reasonable. That would make the figure about $26 billion. Then if you suppose that the 18,000 Catholic parishes spent an average of $200,000 on the needy every year beyond what they contribute to any of these charitable organizations, a number also considered plausible by our experts, that would add another $3.6 billion to the total. All told, this would equal about $30 billion. So how does that slice compare to the entire pie? National Center for Charitable Statistics researchers tallied up expenditures by nonprofits in the broad category of human services, which includes nutrition, employment assistance, legal aid, housing, disaster relief and youth development. In 2010, the most recent year available, they came up with total expenditures of $168 billion in that category. So by our estimate, Catholic-affiliated charity amounts to 17 percent of the funds spent by nonprofits on social services -- well short of the 50 percent Keating cited. Even doubling this share to create a generous margin of error brings it to 34 percent -- still well short of half. But even this may overestimate the footprint of Catholic-supported charities, since it doesnt include social-service expenditures by the government. In his comment, Keating didnt specify that he was only talking about social services funded by private groups. According to the Congressional Budget Office, federal spending on means-tested programs and tax credits totaled $588 billion in 2012, more than triple what the private sector spent. If you factor in federal spending on these programs, the Catholic share shrinks further, to somewhere in the mid-single digits, depending on how generous your estimate is. Indeed, the government even foots a notable share of the bill for Catholic charitable work through social service contracts. According to NETWORK, a Catholic social-justice lobbying group, the federal government sent more than $1.5 billion to Catholic organizations over a recent two-year period. In 2012, the Economist reported that 62 percent of Catholic Charities support came from local, state and federal government agencies. And indirectly, the government maintains a tax exemption for churches and charities, which enables all religious groups to devote more of their funds to charitable work. Taxpayers who itemize can also deduct their donations to charities, including Catholic ones. Our ruling Keating said, In the United States, 50 percent of social services are provided by the Catholic church. Hes right that Catholic groups are among the biggest providers of social-service charity in the nation, but it doesnt appear that they account for half of all such charity. Were admittedly using a bit of guesswork, but Catholic charity seems to account for 17 percent to 34 percent of all nonprofit social-service charity, depending on how generous an estimate you make. And that share drops to single digits once you factor in the money the federal government spends on means-tested programs."
16880,half-true,Greg Abbott,"In Texas, we've had three ISIS-related incidents already.","After the recent terrorist attacks in France, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott was among governors declaring they would not accept Syrian refugees because of a potential for terrorism. Abbott appeared on The Real Story, a Fox News program, on Nov.17, 2015, to explain his stance on keeping refugees out of Texas because of security concerns. We've had three ISIS-related incidents already and now with the possible connection of one of the Syrian refugees being involved in the terrorist attack in Paris, Abbott said, Texas is saying 'no more.  We wondered whether Texas was really the site of so many ISIS plots. Abbott spokesman John Wittman pointed us to a letter from Abbott to Obama dated Nov. 16, 2015, which said: The threat posed to Texas by ISIS is very real. ISIS claimed credit last May when two terrorist gunmen launched an attack in Garland, Texas. Less than two weeks later, the FBI arrested an Iraqi-born man in North Texas and charged him with lying to federal agents about traveling to Syria to fight with ISIS. The letter went on to say that in 2014, when I served as Texas attorney general, we participated in a Joint Terrorism Task Force that arrested two Austin residents for providing material support to terrorists -- including ISIS. To determine if Abbott got his facts straight, we looked at each of the incidents. An Austin-area arrest and conviction Some of this was old ground for us. In September 2014, when Abbott was the state attorney general also running for governor, he claimed hed been involved in prosecuting a terrorist member of ISIS. We found that claim False; Abbott offered no evidence to back up his declaration aside from a press release crediting a range of agencies including the attorney general as well as the Killeen Police Department and Texas Alcoholic Beverage Commission. Abbotts statement also relied on a broad definition of terrorist and ISIS member. A federal complaint indicated Michael Todd Wolfe of Austin may have sought to be those things. But the complaint didnt confirm hed become a terrorist or ISIS member. In the case in question, Wolfe and Rahatul Khan of Round Rock, Texas, were charged with attempting to provide material support to terrorists. Wolfe had tried to board an international flight out of George Bush Intercontinental Airport that would take him to the first stop on a planned journey to Syria. In June 2015, Wolfe was sentenced to seven years in prison for attempting to provide material support to terrorists. According to the criminal complaint, Khan attempted to recruit an undercover FBI agent to a terrorist cell over the Internet. He was sentenced to 10 years imprisonment. The pipeline was affiliated with al-Shabaab — the al-Qaeda-linked Somali militant group behind the mass slaying of Christian students at a Kenyan university earlier this year—not ISIS. Abbotts second described incident In his 2015 letter to Obama, Abbott also referenced concerns about Bilal Abood, the Iraqi-born man in North Texas. Court documents show Abood migrated to the United States in 2009, and offer the following account of his subsequent movement and activities: On March 29, 2013, FBI agents prevented Abood from boarding a flight at Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport. He told them he was planning to visit family. Interviewed a second time five days later, Abood said his intent was to join the Free Syrian Army (FSA) in the struggle against Bashar al-Assad, the president of Syria. Later in April 2013, Abood travelled to Turkey via Mexico, on or about April 29. Agents again interviewed Abood upon his return to the United States on Sept. 16, 2013. He admitted he had travelled to Syria and stayed in an FSA camp, but denied financially supporting any terrorist group. A search of Aboods computer in July 2014 found that he had tweeted a pledge of allegiance to Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the leader of ISIS, on June 19, 2014. He later denied pledging allegiance to ISIS and was arrested for making a materially false, fictitious and fraudulent statement and representation, in a matter within the jurisdiction of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Abbotts letter mischaracterizes the nature of Aboods offense; he wrote that Abood was charged with lying to federal agents about traveling to Syria to fight with ISIS, not lying about a tweet. Shootings in Garland The third incident referenced by Abbott was the Garland, Texas, shooting scheme attempted by Elton Simpson and Nadir Soofi on May 5, 2015. According to a criminal complaint the FBI later filed against a Florida man who claimed to have encouraged the attack, the two planned to shoot attendees at a contest centered around cartoons of the prophet Muhammad (drawing the prophet Muhammad is forbidden in Islam). However, they were shot and killed outside the event by police. This incident is the only foiled attack included in a Department Homeland Security analysis of all ISIS-related arrests on United States soil from January 2014 to September 2015 (the other cases were unsuccessful and successful attempts to travel to fight with ISIS, provide material support to ISIS, and engage in early stage aspirational attack planning). In the aftermath of the shooting, ISIS claimed credit. However, by the time Abbott made his claim, investigators had yet to issue any statement characterizing the Garland attack as having been ordered by members of ISIS. Simpson was involved in terrorist causes before ISIS even split off from Al-Qaeda. He was arrested by the FBI in 2010 after discussing jihad and potential travel to Somalia with an informant the previous year. Allison Mahan, an FBI spokeswoman in Dallas, told us via email, The Garland attackers were ISIS-inspired and the investigation is ongoing. ISIS-inspired terrorist attacks are much more common than attacks directly ordered by members of the group, according to an analysis published in the October 2015 issue of the Terrorism Research Initiatives Perspectives on Terrorism. The TRI is an international consortium of scholars founded in 2007 to facilitate security studies research. Our ruling In his opposition to resettlement of Syrian refugees in Texas, Gov. Greg Abbott said he was concerned about potential terrorism from devotees to the Islamic State. In Texas, Abbott said, we've had three ISIS-related incidents already. Abbottis on solid ground with one Islamic State-related incident — the Garland shooting plot. In other Texas arrests related tothe group, he uses the term incident to cover things including lying about a tweet and trying to travel to Syria.
